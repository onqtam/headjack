We mean something analogous to the idea of social engineering, a concept that came about at the end of the 19th century that refers to the intentional design of specific social arrangements and ways of operating. The Reddit platform itself is not social technology, but its use of moderators is...
>
> It’s important to note that all except the simplest social technologies are designed. Though many of our crucial social technologies seem like natural parts of reality today, this was not always so. At some point they required intentional construction and adoption. Many social technologies we take for granted, including the very idea of having such critical systems as currency, law, and government, were born from concerted human agency. It is for this reason that we call it social technology, rather than social “norms”, or take a broader anthropological or philosophical approach. Much like material technology, social technology is designed, adopted, and scaled. It is proceduralized and documentable.

The giver and recipient collaborate to publicly assert that the recipient is worthy of prestige, and that the giver has the authority to grant it. Honors are thus acts of an alliance to mutually boost prestige...

> "If one looks closely at any society, one will observe that its rulers—and their prestige—subsidize all other sources of prestige. Thus, when the landscape of power shifts, the landscape of prestige shifts accordingly. It is then critical that rulers are incentivized to allocate prestige well—that is, in accordance with the actual distribution of excellence. If they aren’t, as in the case of Stalin, the resulting distortions in the allocation of prestige produce distortions in their society’s understanding of what is good and what is true. Lysenkoism was an epistemic and moral disaster. This kind of corruption can ultimately have catastrophic effects on the society’s health, because the ability to ascertain the truth is fundamental to the functionality of a society’s people and its institutions." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)
^^ not sure how to use this quote... maybe parts of it?

> "Among the many different kinds of honors, we can pick out two especially common ones: those meant to incentivize a particular achievement with a financial reward, which I call prizes, and those meant to afford prestige on the basis of past achievement, which I call awards. Prizes aim to get some specific thing done, whereas awards aim to affect the distribution of prestige, incentivizing achievement in a more indirect way. With a prize, money is fundamental. With an award, it is incidental. The Millennium Prizes are a prime example of the former, the Academy Awards of the latter.
>
> This distinction is often muddled, leading honors to be less effective than they could be. I have to clarify what I mean by each term, because in practice they aren’t used in a reliable way. There are awards that are called prizes and prizes that are called awards. Despite its name, the Nobel Prize is a hybrid case that is more of an award. Though it comes with a financial reward, it is primarily about affording prestige, and this is what those who try to win it are after. The money is nice, but the glory is better.
>
> It’s for this reason that I think that awards are more effective than prizes in incentivizing the production of knowledge. Glory is a greater motivator than money...
>
> A prize also provides less return on its creator’s investment of social capital than an award. Once the goal is achieved and the prize won, there is no longer a reason for it to exist. It is self-abolishing. An award, on the other hand, can continue to be given out year after year, compounding the investment of prestige." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "The more closely social status corresponds to activity that’s ultimately beneficial for society, the more such activity is incentivized, much more strongly than by even a large financial reward.

> "Status is one of the irreplaceable currencies whose necessary transfer is often denounced in this way. Michael Sauder et al. define status as the relative respect and patterns of deference accorded to people, groups and organizations by wider society... People cannot engage in any common projects without some commonly agreed-upon deference to people, groups or organizations, nor can they engage in common projects without someone or something holding, and yes, spending status. Status is a coordination mechanism, and this makes it valuable.
>
> If we come together to do great things, much status is required, whether vested in an institution or an individual. That someone will be holding status in this sense, personally or as a representative of an organization, then, is an unavoidable consequence of people coming together to do things. Perhaps one can argue for a dispersed distribution of status as the best way for us to organize such efforts, but the fact is that deference by some towards others on technical and resource distribution questions is still the central guiding factor." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

The key problems here are the creation and identification of sufficient skill, together with ensuring the next founder has inherited a position of sufficient power to remake the institution. Of course, even if the succession problem is handled once, it remains a problem for the next generation.
>
> If the succession problem remains unsolved, the only process of institutional reform available is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as “creative destruction”. That our society valorizes rather than bemoans such outcomes unfortunately demonstrates that we have become accustomed to failed succession and notable dysfunction.

> "In the West today, we operate under the influence of our own key philosophy, which we can call scientism: the tendency to rely on scientific claims to describe the functioning of society, even when there is no empirical reason to assume that they apply. We act as if we are already living in a scientifically-planned society, immune to collapse on a timescale that any of us have to worry about. This is very far from the truth. We are certainly living in socially-engineered societies, but they are not scientifically planned in any straightforward way. Our organs of economic management do not secretly know how the economy really works. Our systems of political regulation are operating on the fumes of their institutional inheritance from two or three generations ago—the last spurt of institutional growth in Western societies happened roughly during the 1970s." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "Our society is dominated by large bureaucracies. These bureaucracies break down the processing of physical goods and information into discrete tasks, such as how a factory worker puts doors on a car, or a stock trader buys futures contracts. These tasks are shorn of their context and executed in a systematized environment whose constraints are quite narrow: put the car door in, increase the portfolio value. Our society is thoroughly compartmentalized. This compartmentalization isn’t driven by the division of labor, but rather by the need to make use of misaligned talent without empowering it. By radically limiting employees’ scope of action, you make office politics more predictable. By fragmenting available knowledge, you can leverage information asymmetries to the intellectual or material advantage of the center. Some of this is necessary for scaling organizations beyond what socially connected networks can manage—but move too far towards compartmentalization, and it becomes impossible to accomplish the original mission of the organization." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

Some could be distinguished by their focus on economic concerns, others on scientific, martial, religious, or humanitarian ones. But all of them had a system of awarding, regulating, and seizing status and prestige and, in fact, that system is the engine that drives a society to concern itself with something or other beyond its mere survival... The assignment of status and prestige to one field or another will directly affect how much effort is put into it, and thus how much a society achieves in that field." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)




> "We are bad at allocating attention, both individually and collectively. For example, how much attention do you pay to your friends and family, or to the existential question of the meaning of your life? And how much attention are we paying as humanity to the great challenges and opportunities of our time, such as the climate crisis and space travel? Markets are not able to help us better allocate attention because prices do not, and cannot, exist for many of the issues that we should be paying attention to. Consider paying attention to finding your purpose in life: there is no supply and demand that will form a ‘purpose price’ for an individual; it’s ultimately up to you to allocate enough attention to this existential question." - [The World After Capital, by Albert Wenger](https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/readme#:~:text=We%20are%20bad,this%20existential%20question.)

If we all used bots to interact with Facebook and didn’t like how our newsfeed was prioritized, we could ask our friends to instruct their bots to send us status updates directly, so that we could form our own feeds.

The reason users don’t wield the same power on mobile is that native apps relegate end users to interacting with services using our eyes, ears, brain and fingers. We cannot use the computing capabilities of our smartphones, which are as powerful as supercomputers were until quite recently, in order to interact with the apps on our behalf. The apps control us, instead of us controlling the apps. Like a Web browser, a mobile user agent could do things such as block ads, keep copies of responses to services and let users participate in multiple services simultaneously.

Unfortunately, in the US there are three separate laws that make those steps illegal. The first is the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The second is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). And the third is the legal construction that by clicking ‘I accept’ on an End User License Agreement (EULA) or a set of Terms of Service (TOS), I am legally bound to respect whatever restrictions Facebook decides to impose.

> "It is a matter of power. If we compare the level of voter turn-out in different elections for different forms of political body, a clear pattern emerges. There is a direct link between power and turn-out: the more power is up for grabs, or, to put it another way, the more power is connected to the position or body to which people are being elected, the greater the level of voter interest. This means that the crisis of democracy has nothing to do with a loss of faith in active politicians per se, but is mainly to do with a growing concern about the increasing impotence of politicians. The silent protest of a growing number of couch potatoes is not directed towards politicians’ abuse of power, but towards their loss of power.
>
> This fact is, unfortunately, not particularly 'sexy’, and does not fit in with media dramaturgy; it does not provide any attention-grabbing headlines and it does not provide ammunition for a bout of populist mud slinging. And, above all, it does not serve the interests of the media. So, instead, we are supplied with a constant stream of propaganda telling us about the righteous contempt that the people feel for the corrupt political class, which only serves to weaken the position of politicians still further, which in turn leads to a new round of gauntlet running in the media. This process continues in a vicious circle, the inevitable culmination of which is the death of representative democracy, the complete impotence of politicians and a hyper-real media dictatorship. This process is strengthened by feedback. Through the use of opinion polls, whose questions are obviously phrased by the media to serve their own purposes, the population is told what it thinks and what it is ‘natural’ to think. Then the media go on to show how the adaptable politicians are adapting to this norm, or pretend to be adapting, and so the process goes on and on, ad infinitum. The investigations of the mass media are, on their most profound level, investigations into the mass media themselves. Statistics that purport to represent public opinion are actually the tools used by the media to manufacture opinion." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "Speed and the abolishment of distance hastened the materialization of information. The telegraph revolutionized the transport of information over long distances and, as a consequence, a great deal of contemporary attention was paid to transportation and speed, while other aspects - such as interpretation, context and comprehension - were neglected. A piece of quickly transported information came to be regarded as something valuable in itself, quite regardless of what it meant or could be used for. But the fact that technology solves one problem does not mean that all related problems disappear or become less pressing. Working out how to transport information over great distances does not mean that people know how to interpret and understand the information in a relevant context. What happens is simply that some things are left in the shade when the sun rises over a new paradigm. For every problem solved by a technology, at least one new problem usually appears." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

What we lack today is not information, but overview and context.

> "How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the elite in power within a democracy - the best-organized lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates - can effectively achieve the same result. Against any given collection of Tacts’, another instantly appears; against the report of any given piece of alarming scientific research, another more reassuring one appears. And so on. And afterwards everything gets back to business as usual. It looks like a vital democracy, but it is merely a spectacle for the masses. This torrent of information is thus no unforeseen phenomenon and certainly in no way a fortuitous lottery jackpot for the citizens and consumers, but is actually a conscious strategy for maintaining social control. Powerful interest groups send out murky clouds of distracting information in order to maintain the secrecy of certain essential knowledge. The overload of information and the lack of context are intimately linked, two aspects of the same subject." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

The frequent showers of contradictory information have one single coherent message: don’t trust your experiences and perceptions - listen to The Latest instead. But The Latest is quickly succeeded by The Very Latest, and it is practically impossible to imagine any information, any combination of new facts, that could affect the status quo to any noticeable degree: partly for practical reasons, because facts are so fickle and their rate of replacement so high, partly purely theoretically, because there is an absence of any context that is valid for the whole of the social collective, from which the implications of these facts could be determined.

> The public, consisting of engaged citizens with a common interest in and responsibility for the general good - the classic precondition of democracy - never materialized in reality. Instead, the ever more vocal mass of the population and the ever more ambitious middle class, which had so terrified the privileged elite of the nineteenth century, are being transformed under the relentlessly increasing pressure of information into a divided and ruler-friendly multitude of antagonistic special-interest groups. This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, in other words, all this torrent of new information that is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, ‘precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure’.

> "If the eighteenth century’s newspapers and pamphlets had reflected a genuine, revolutionary opinion that was critical of power, then the press during the nineteenth century was considerably more of an instrument of power with which the public was consciously manipulated and a general opinion manufactured. This means that it is still correct to regard the press, and information, as a weapon. But also that it is important to keep an eye on whose finger is on the trigger, and which interests this person represents. The capitalist elite, like every other, sought to maintain the status quo. The primary task of its propaganda was to protect social, economic and political privileges in an age when privileges were no longer the fashion and when increasing welfare and improved education were leading to demands for more rapid increases in equality. Those in power sought, quite consciously, with the help of the PR experts who were beginning to sharpen their tools by the beginning of the twentieth century, to turn the increase in welfare and the improvements in education to their own advantage and persuade the ambitious middle class of the advantages of entering into a tacit but nonetheless effective pact. The trick was to present the alternative - political change - as something extremely unpleasant. The message was that the newspaper-reading middle class risked losing its hard-won gilt-edged life if the existing order was disturbed: that chaos and mob rule threatened if the winds of change were set free. The trick worked. It was possible, it turned out, to manufacture opinion. PR methods were built on science - what else? The PR experts regarded themselves as scientists." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The electronic mass media offered even better opportunities to set people’s tongues in motion. The printed word still requires a certain level of education in order to be understood, whereas radio, for instance, requires nothing but the flick of a switch and adequate hearing. This gave propagandists of all descriptions an opportunity to get inside people’s homes in a way that was historically unique. Film, and eventually television, offered the opportunity to communicate directly through images. For someone looking at images, either moving or frozen, their perspective and the act of seeing are determined by the originator of the image. This opens what the critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin calls ‘the optics of the unconscious’: a shortcut for the camera to bypass the intellectual censorship that comes into effect when we have to adopt a position towards a message on the abstract level of words; a direct channel into the individual’s private dream factory where unexpressed desires and fears roam about. Anyone who can manage to stay awake will experience a stimulating massage of his or her irrational inner self.
>
> The theatrical presentation of democracy demanded steady direction if it was not to go off the rails: this was the main creed and business idea of the developing PR industry. Historical factors - welfare and education - made it necessary for the ruling and - naturally - responsible elite to develop a well-stocked toolbox of power so as to be prepared for all eventualities. General opinion was in constant need of tending and pruning - no undesirable weeds could be permitted to grow too tall. The masses could easily start to think a mass of foolish ideas. The medicine for this was information, but it must be administered by experts within the mass media and the world of social psychology. With the help of precise science it would be possible, in theory at least, to fine-tune the intellectual and emotional life of the masses.

> "This activity is carried out to an extent unimagined by the general population. One tangible example, taken from the sociologist Stuart Ewen, is how American opinion was programmed fundamentally and in good time for a potential military offensive against Iraq in the early 1990s. One congressional inquiry that gained a great deal of media attention involved a 15-year-old girl from Kuwait, a hospital volunteer who testified that she had witnessed with her own eyes how, after the invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi troops had entered the hospital in Kuwait City, dragged premature babies out of their incubators and left them to die on cold corridor floors. This grim act of barbarism outraged the USA. No one paid any heed to the fact that the girl in question remained anonymous, for the stated reason that her own safety was at risk. Only in retrospect, when the war was long over, did it emerge that the girl was actually Nayirah al-Sabah, daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the USA, and that she could not possibly have seen the things she testified to having seen. It also became apparent that her appearance before the inquiry had been arranged by one Gary Hymel, vice-MD of Hill & Knowlton, one of the largest PR companies in the world, which counted the Kuwaiti royal family among its wealthy clients. Nayirah’s testimony was part of a conscious and successful strategy and was one of a great number of manufactured media events, all designed to direct American fury at Baghdad." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Increased competition is not visible so much in the form of direct confrontations as it is in the division of every market into several smaller, ever more specialized sub-departments. Every player, both individuals and entire cultures, is forced to distil those qualities that are in demand by the particular niche of the market holding sway at that moment, to the detriment of general knowledge and overview. This leads to the development of an increasingly tightly connected, finely meshed network of mutual dependency.

The principle of transparency is that all the members of the network have access to all relevant information, and that at any time they wish they can make their own contribution to the internal debate. All cards are on the table, everyone can form their own opinion and make comments, everyone can participate in the decision-making process. If transparency is the dominant principle in informational society, this will entail a revolution in the labour market. When a traditional business is transformed into a transparent network, the employer can no longer treat employees according to feudal principles governing the exercise of power.

Each successful decision one way or another might lead to spectacular gains, while each unsuccessful decision about access or exclusion might have devastating consequences for the curators’, and therefore the network’s, reputation and credibility. It is reputation, or capital of trust, that is the network’s most important asset; with the help of reputation, attention is attracted to the networks, and there is a great shortage of attention, rather than money, on the net.

The curator will assume the state’s function as moral guardian and will punish all transgressions against netiquette by expelling the delinquent from attractive networks. Exclusion, restricted access to information and other forms of rescinded membership privileges are the netocracy’s methods for deterring and controlling dissidents. Severe limitations of virtual mobility will be the informational equivalent to internment. To protect their common interests and make the administration of the networks more effective, the curators will establish their powerful meta-networks for policy questions about net policing.

> "So much ideological capital has been invested in the idea of bourgeois democracy that every attempt to examine its propaganda critically and every discussion of possible faults in the democratic theory have been rejected with distaste and labelled as heresy by the immense forces guarding this myth. A cult has been constructed around democracy and its rituals: a cult with strikingly irrational elements, a mass movement whose cohesive idea is the notion that the magical power of the correct political procedure can solve, or at least ameliorate, all serious social problems. The forms of democracy themselves are believed to conjure up sound political content. The correct method of making decisions always results in wise decisions, according to this most potent of democracy’s dogmas. The self-appointed representatives of political goodness have persuaded themselves, and anyone who has cared to listen, that there is no difference between the correct method of making decisions and wise decisions, and whenever someone has the bad manners to point out that the Nazis, to take one striking example, came to power as a result of democracy and parliamentary elections, the response is always a series of diffuse explanations about the German population’s ‘democratic immaturity’, and the existence of that specific situation at that particular time. There is seldom or never a recognition that democracy itself is no guarantee for good and wise decision making.
>
> Every exception is turned around so that it confirms the general rule: as soon as the democratic maturity of the population has reached a certain acceptable level, democracy will automatically produce wise decisions like a well-oiled political machine. This faith in the process of democratic maturity of the population is as unshakeabie as it is unfounded. It is a matter of religious faith rather than empirical knowledge. According to the axiom, voters cannot vote wrongly, and if the people should nonetheless do so - like the Austrian people did when a populist rightwing party was elevated to government in the dying weeks of the twentieth century, a result which the rest of the European Union strongly opposed - then it is simply a matter of pronouncing loudly that a mistake has been made and bringing about a correction through suitable actions.
>
> This is all about the bourgeoisie’s parading democracy as if it in itself were something holy, yet being unable to accept democracy when it conflicts with the bourgeoisie’s own interests. There is a considerable amount of hypocrisy in the ceremonial rhetoric of democracy. What is at best a problematic and fragile compromise between conflicting political forces, and at worst a method of legitimizing the decisions that the elite wants to force through, is elevated as something good, eternal and beyond all doubt - something in accordance with the laws of nature. Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The real traditional family is something entirely different: an economic union and socialization project that links various generations together. The nuclear family - which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another late-twentieth-century phenomenon, nuclear weapons - ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of late-capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital (once again in the same boat), that people develop into ‘independent individuals’ rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realization, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.
>
> The nuclear family arose because it was the smallest, most individualized social entity that was feasible once the necessary requirements of reproduction had been taken into consideration. But as far as the state, and capital, are concerned, it does not need to be stable at all. A single parent is more dependent upon subsidies than a couple, and is therefore more submissive and more easily controlled. A marked increase in the number of single-occupancy homes also means, naturally, that consumption increases dramatically. The ideal would be for everyone to live alone in their own home, with their own car, so that optimal demand for houses, cars, sofas, cookers, etc., could be achieved. The path of the isolated, independent individual towards self-realization always passes through increased consumption." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Similarly, if we ask ourselves what politics really is, the answer is that politics is merely a continuation of religion by other means. And it definitely not only applies to Bolshevism or to other more or less doctrinal and airy-fairy movements with distinct features of sectarianism.

This is what people do and devote their lives to. We are, as Haidt writes, no saints, but sometimes we are really good team players. “Religion is loyalty to the world”, as the forefather of syntheism Alfred North Whitehead puts it." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "We all constantly act like believers in our everyday lives... We are all laymen in all conceivable subject areas that lie outside our own professional fields. We have first-hand knowledge of extremely little of everything that lies at the core of our existence and our societies. Accordingly, we choose our authorities on more or less arbitrary grounds, and we then choose to believe in what they claim without being able to investigate the matter to any extent at all. Dennett uses the formula e=mc2 as an example. Do we believe in it? Many of us have heard about it, and many believe they know it to be accepted by a number of experts within physics, which makes it appear truthful and plausible. But few of us can actually explain in any detail why, because few of us can be said to understand the formula in any reasonable sense of the word “understand”. So how can we believe in something we do not understand?
>
> What we do, according to Dennett, is believe that anything asserted about the formula e=mc2 is actually true. But in truth we do not know. And for this reason, it is impossible to attain anything even resembling consensus on, for example, the issue of the climate crisis. What opinion the layman has about it depends largely on what authorities he chooses to believe in, which in turn is governed by his political positions on issues that pertain to economic growth and government regulation, among other things. We believe in what agrees with what we already believe in. We are religious...
>
> The new, rational human being, freed from superstition and systematic self-delusion by the sciences that are making heroic progress, is a completely unrealistic utopia without any foundation in what research actually tells us about how people really function. We are religious, whether we understand it or not. We believe, and believe that we know much more than we actually do know. And actually it really does not matter at all what content is proclaimed from pulpits or in scripture. The person who enters into a discussion about the apparent self-contradictions or absurdities in a religious doctrine is barking up the wrong tree. Some believe in God X, endowed with certain attributes and preferences, while others believe in something else, which is either called God or something else. What is important and interesting is whether, and in that case how, religion actually works. Trying to understand religion’s tenacity and fervour by studying various ideas of God is, writes Jonathan Haidt, like trying to understand the attraction of football games to their audience by studying how the ball moves on the pitch.
>
> Religion has developed through cultural evolution, just like all other social-collective phenomena. Today we can reject a number of features of the content of many religions – it would be strange if it were not so – but we can hardly deny that they have served certain purposes under certain historically determined sets of conditions; and nor can we reasonably deny that they have in fact served these purposes with considerable success; otherwise religions would have perished without leaving many traces. But they did not. Along with psychologists such as Haidt and anthropologists such as Scott Atran and Joe Henrich we argue that the main reason is that this cultural innovation increased the coherence within groups and made them cooperate better internally compared to other groups. This did not necessarily mean that the other groups were outcompeted, but rather that they allowed themselves to be absorbed by the more effective religions.
>
> The crucial point of having a god is that the god is said to reward loyalty and cooperation, while punishing selfishness and mendacity. An all-seeing god is particularly effective in such a context, since people cheat less when they feel that they are being watched. Common sacrifices and collective rites increase coherence, which creates the trust within the group that enables intimate and trusting cooperation outside the circle of family members. According to Haidt with support from Charles Darwin and the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, the main function of religion is that it produces groups whose coherence makes them function like organisms. The biologist David Sloan Wilson writes in his book Darwin’s Cathedral that religions primarily exist in order for it to be possible for people to accomplish together what they cannot accomplish on their own.
>
> This productive coherence exercises a powerful allure for reasons that we need not address further. We humans are social creatures who experience well-being by doing things together with others, and its contrast – alienation and isolation – is not something on which one can build dynamic and prosperous societies. This in turn means, as Haidt points out, that in the sense of being modern people, enlightened and rational, we can choose to reject organised religion, but even if we do so, we cannot emancipate ourselves just like that from the basic religious psychology that we are concerned with here. However, we can, as stated, always manipulate the terminology and imagine that religion is something other than religion, because we have decided to call it something else, if this makes us feel modern and clear-thinking.
>
> Thus we have actually answered our opening question. God does exist. At least and without a doubt in an ontological sense. We have ourselves created the idea, just as we have created the ideas of democracy and art and a host of others. Religion lives, even among those who believe they have left it. Everything is religion and everyone is a believer. Anyone claiming the opposite, is truly, literally speaking, blinded by their faith. The really interesting question which thereby opens up is what to do with God and religion in the Internet age, when all the basic assumptions of our lives and existence are changing. How can God and religion become relevant, credible and engaging concepts for us and for future generations? That is the question which Syntheism seeks to answer." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The term religion stems from Medieval French where it signified the strong and heartfelt sense of community that prevails within a collective, a group of people who make up a congregation through establishing this loyalty to each other. This French term in turn originates from the Latin re-ligare: to reconnect with somebody or something, to connect again with those who, for some reason or other, have lost contact with each other but who ought to, and/or want to, belong together. So if we follow this term back to its source, we find that in its original sense religion ought to be seen as a social practice, organised with the purpose of creating strong and enduring ties between people, an affinity that in some cases, but far from always, also includes affinity between people and a set of gods, a theism.
>
> According to the Austrian monk David Steindl-Rast, religious practice starts with doctrine, which is followed by ethics and finally consummated in ritual – all with the purpose of creating a social emergence, to unite people around an entity that they experience as greater than themselves individually, and greater than the sum of the group of individuals. This is definitely something worth bearing in mind: the original point of religion was to create affinity and loyalty within a dynamic collective. In this context, God is no more than the arbitrarily chosen name for the sense of belonging that people seek. Nowhere is this usage of God as a productive object of projection clearer than in the person who has failed in life in his or her own mind and is bravely struggling for self-restitution. When Bill Wilson founds Alcoholics Anonymous in the United States in the 1930s for example, it was with the unshakeable conviction that religion – in whichever form it appears, as long as it preaches a sense of belonging that is greater and mightier than the small, cramped prison, which is how the addict experiences his/her own subjectivity – is the best possible springboard out of alcohol addiction. Religion is that within us which is greater than ourselves and for precisely this reason it is closer to our hearts than our fragile little egos." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

And if we do not find any such patterns, we don’t hesitate to quite simply invent them. With a utopia on the horizon, we give our lives a direction and a context. God is another name for utopia, and utopia is another name for God.
>
> The productive and fruitful response to atheism is not to indifferently accept the death of God, but to instead realise that it was a mistake to place God in the past as the ageless progenitor of us and the cosmos. We have already killed the God of the past by producing and accumulating large quantities of knowledge with which this divinity is not compatible. God as a functional utopia is instead the name of what we dream of creating; God is Syntheos, the created rather than the creating God. God is not (any longer) dead, since (we have now realised that) God has never been born: God belongs to us because God belongs to the future, and we already live in the future. The French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux expresses the syntheist passion in the words: “God is too important a concept to be left in the hands of the religious.”" - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

The Internet is thereby transformed from a technological into a theological phenomenon. The Internet is the God of the new age, and furthermore extremely appropriate for an age characterised by an unlimited faith in the possibilities of creativity. Thus, the Internet is a god that even those who regard themselves as atheists can devote themselves to. Syntheologically, we express this state of affairs as that the Internet is a manifestation of Syntheos, the new god that we humans are creating rather than the old god which, according to our ancestors, is said to have created us once upon a time in a distant past." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "If there is anything we can say with certainty, it is that alienation in the new network society will increase dramatically. A growing alienation is the price we pay for every increase in the technological and social complexity that we are experiencing now and for years to come. With the Internet’s breakthrough, it is literally exploding. And there is only one functional weapon against alienation, namely its opposite: religion. Traditional religion’s mistake was to place the name of its longing for another world, God, in the past (theism, belief in a preordained God), when the logically correct and only reasonable manoeuvre of course is to place the object of all human longing, God, in the future (syntheism, the belief in a God that man himself creates).
>
> The atheism that denies longing – between theism and syntheism – has played out its role as the necessary antipole between thesis and synthesis. For in its lack of content, and as pure negation, atheism is completely meaningless as the goal of the dialectical process. This acute lack of essence explains why atheists have never succeeded in building any cathedrals or anything at all except vapid paper monuments to their own excellence. It is like a philosophical temperance movement: you meet and are sober together, totally oblivious of the ecstatic party that is going on somewhere else entirely. Classical atheism can only say what it is not, but not what it de facto is. This purely negative and in essence substance-less doctrine is quite simply a worthless weapon against alienation. It consoles no one and explains nothing." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Only through a new syntheistic meta-narrative, constructed on the utopian conviction that humanity’s only possible salvation is through its creation of Syntheos, can the ecological apocalypse be avoided. It is not possible to preserve human life on the planet with any amount of politics. For politics is subservient to the capitalist death drive – there is no chance of becoming a leading politician without first becoming dependent on the statist-corporativistic power structure – which does its utmost to grind on relentlessly with its ruthless plundering of resources until the planet is uninhabitable and lifeless.

The Western welfare state, which is based on precisely such institutionalised wishful thinking about strong and continuous growth, is looking more and more like a cynical pyramid scheme.

> "If history is viewed as a Hegelian dialectics, we see a clear pattern: monotheism is the thesis, individualism is the antithesis and syntheism is the synthesis. That syntheism is the synthesis in this dialectical process is a consequence of the fact that theism and atheism can never meet; they are fundamentally and definitionally incompatible. Syntheism should absolutely not be understood as a compromise between theism and atheism – in Hegelian dialectics, a synthesis is something considerably more sophisticated than just a banal coalescence of thesis and antithesis – rather, it is a necessary continuation of theism’s and atheism’s combined dichotomy, the only possible way out of the paralysing deadlock that arises when theism and atheism are pitted against each other. As the logical synthesis of this pair of opposites (theism versus atheism), syntheism offers a possibility for the atheist to go further and uncompromisingly deepen atheism...
>
> Only through perfecting the individualist paradigm can mankind grasp its terrible consequences, and then, and only then, the door to the syntheist possibility swings open... Atheism robs the human being of her access to the holy and the divine by first sharing theism’s conviction that the holy and the divine must be synonymous with the transcendental, and then murdering the transcendental and thus reducing the human being to a cold and indifferent immanence, which is axiomatic for atheism. What syntheism does is that it picks up mankind in precisely the immanence where atheism has abandoned him and makes him apprehend the immanent as the truly holy and divine without any nostalgic longing for transcendentalism at all.

> "German philosopher Jürgen Habermas launches intersubjectivity as the highest truth that humans can aspire to after Kant has shifted objective reality to where it is hopelessly out of reach. According to Habermas, the absence of this objectivity can only be confronted and militated against by an extensive plurality of subjective voices. Habermas imagines that intersubjectivity is negotiated between actors on an equal footing in the public sphere, which is both laborious and time-consuming, but which in the end nonetheless yields a satisfactory result, due to lots of subjective positions confronting and interacting with each other. To take one example, the credibility of science is based on the conviction that intersubjective truth can be fished out through the process referred to as peer review.

> "If religion happens to be the answer, which it apparently has been in every type of society that we know of throughout all of human history up until today – what then is the question? What is it that makes the religious memeplex in particular so attractive and successful in the cultural evolutionary process?
>
> To start with, we cannot help but note that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to eagerly welcome religious memes and become a believer brain. Being part of the religious community is thus something that in one way or another feels satisfying for the individual member of the congregation, while the religious collective gains competitive advantages in relation to other groups because of their special form of cohesion and mutual understanding which creates trust, impetus and efficiency to an extent that is hard to top. Moreover, at least in the transition from the nomadic existence of hunters and gatherers to a settled agricultural one, religious memes are blessed with dedicated propagandists and watchdogs, who regard it as their mission in life to spread these memes in particular further, and to protect them from dangerous competitors in the struggle for survival.
>
> So what is it then that religion has to offer and that makes up for the small and big sacrifices that have always been connected with the practice of religion?...
>
> But the crass and simple answer to the question of what value religion – or what we call religion today – had and still has to offer its practitioners, is survival. Man is a flock animal and can only cope with the hard struggle for survival to the extent that he can create well-functioning groups. A lone individual is easy prey on the savannah. In order to achieve a well-functioning group, at least two things are required: effective communication, and mutual trust which functions best when in it based on common values. And it is precisely that you share the values and feelings of the collective which the devoted practice of religion signals to the world around you. You show that you can be trusted, that your loyalties are the right ones, and that you are a worthy member of the community. Therefore, there are also invariably costs involved in the practice of religion: through paying what it costs to demonstrate your commitment and loyalty to the continued existence of the group you signal that you are prepared to set aside self-interest. A religion, argues the anthropologist William Irons, is basically a control system where the loyalty and devotion of the members of the congregation is monitored by examining the zeal with which they carry out the mandated and preferably also costly rituals.
>
> In this way, you lay the foundation for the necessary trust within the group, and also lay the foundation for the body of regulations that has the task of governing the actions of its individual members, which in turn creates order and security within the system. Accordingly, the selfish deviant is provided with strong incentives to align herself with the group and subordinate herself to its values and set of beliefs. Or at least act as if subservience were the obvious choice. The alternative would be ostracisation or some other powerful sanction. And considering that our hunting and gathering forefathers in principle were constantly at war with other groups of species kinsfolk, who constituted their determined and dangerous competitors in the daily struggle for crucial resources, the cohesion of the collective has always been of the greatest importance. With time Man develops such an intense dependence on the chemicals serotonin and oxytocin, which are released in a torrential stream right at the point when feelings of belonging to the collective are felt, that this dependence in itself appears to be an equally strong foundation for Man’s special status as language or consciousness are.
>
> Warfare necessitates collaboration, in both people and ants, as the science journalist Nicholas Wade observes in his perceptive book The Faith Instinct. For both these species, it is necessary to be able to reliably identify group membership. The ants handle this exclusively with the aid of chemical signals and therefore, in contrast to humans, have no need for religious symbolism. In this context and from this point of view, the fear of the wrath of all-seeing divinities is a good thing: it increases the precision of the signalling system. People believe that selfish behaviour is punished and therefore submit to the given rules. The stronger this fear, the stronger the fabric that binds the society together will be. And the stronger this fabric, the more powerfully the chemical-hormonal reward system that the human being partly shares with the ant will be strengthened. This explains why soldiers who return from the most brutal conflicts often long to be back on the battlefield so intensely that they find it completely impossible to adapt to the peaceful environment at home. They quite simply lack the intense fellowship in the trenches and the chemical-hormonal rewards this sense of belonging is associated with – an experience whose strength only war and religion have succeeded in matching throughout history. With this fact in mind, it is not particularly easy for pacifist atheists to find satisfaction in life.

> Islam originally means precisely submission and every faithful Muslim submits to a strictly circumscribed way of life filled with more or less arduous duties in the form of daily prayers, fasts, pilgrimages, etc. The believer thus becomes a small but significant cog in an infinitely much greater machinery. In key respects, religion is precisely this: a liberation from the petty perspective of one’s own ego and the limited possibilities for asserting oneself in the world, which leads to a merging into a collective organism with everything that this means in terms of the feelings of expansion and ecstasy associated with coordinated behaviour, that is, participation in a socio-cultural emergence process. Singing, dancing, speaking in tongues: through various types of liturgical rites, religion binds the collective together emotionally and creates at least one convincing illusion of access to the transcendental. Personal antipathies and conflicts are lessened or disappear in the rhythmically synchronised intoxication of the community." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "Everything is religion, but everything is also politics. And politics is religion, and religion is to a high degree politics. Without utopias there are no visions, and without visions there is no collective and organised hope of a better life in a society that has undergone desirable changes. In a society without utopias, cynical isolationism reigns supreme in the public arena. For this reason, such a society is the most dangerous society of all. Each and every person at the most cares about herself and her loved ones, but displays a programmatic disinterest in how everyone else fares. This lack of social cohesion sooner or later leads to societal collapse within all key areas. The opposite of utopia is, as we know, dystopia. The approaching ecological apocalypse has emerged as our time’s great and dominant dystopia. The fateful question that will be decisive for the 21st century is how the approaching ecological apocalypse is to be prevented or at least tackled in order to ameliorate or postpone it if possible.
>
> We thus live in an age that lacks a credible utopia, but that at the same time is coloured by a doomsday narrative that is every bit as powerful as it is threatening in the political discourse. Environmental issues are constantly on the agenda, as is the collective guilty conscience because these issues are constantly being down-prioritised by politicians who instead give priority to short-term measures on hip-pocket issues, measures that might perhaps yield the odd job opportunity but that also damage or preclude the necessary improvements in the environment. The growing plurarchy in a society where everyone talks at cross purposes, and increasingly vociferously focuses on pseudo-issues, evokes a paralysing state of hypercynicism (see The Netocrats). At the same time it is at precisely chaotic points in history of this type that new metaphysical systems are established – with Pauline Christianity in the crumbling Roman Empire and Kantian individualism in conjunction with the French Revolution as two very clear examples – and there is no reason to believe that our age should be any different in this respect.
>
> The hypercynical state is namely due to the fact that the prevailing ideological paradigm is no longer in step with its surrounding material reality. Rather, the lack of utopianism and the abundance of dystopianism is the final proof of the prevailing paradigm having reached the end of the road and lost all remaining remnants of relevance." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is hardly a coincidence that these two movements are arising in the same places in the world – namely in Northern Europe and along the coasts of North American – since it is in these places that the expansion of the Internet is most powerful, psychedelic experimentation most extensive, and thus the insight into the planet’s vulnerability is being disseminated most rapidly and is gaining first a foothold. These two movements are, quite simply, two sides of the same metaphysical coin, and it is syntheism that is the coin itself." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The key issue when we are talking about a free and open Internet is of course how much transparency a society should and can handle. It is then important to understand that the problem with transparency is never the transparency itself – to confess, to lay bare one’s heart of hearts for one’s fellow sisters and brothers in the community, is also a holy act within syntheism – but how it affects the network pyramid in question, that is, who lays himself bare for whom and thereby risks, at least in the short-term, a possible loss of power first? Does the current transparentisation strengthen the top, middle or bottom of the prevailing power structure in the society? Is the power structure levelled out in the direction of the syntheist utopia’s radical equality, or is the prevailing power structure reinforced in such a way that social inequality is preserved?
>
> We seek the answers to these questions for example in the French philosopher Michael Foucault’s pragmatist ethics: If the transparentisation begins from the top down – that is, if it is the rulers who have all of their secrets exposed first – it can be implemented painlessly throughout the entire power structure from the top and all the way down. On the other hand, if the transparentisation begins from the bottom up, the consequence will no doubt be a capitalist police state, and thereby – apart from all the other misery that such a development would entail – the ecological apocalypse would soon be unavoidable. It is the citizens who must first know everything about the activities of the nation state and the major corporations rather than the statist-corporatist establishment being allowed to bug and register the citizens’ opinions and preferences.
>
> Therefore, according to syntheism the battle of WikiLeaks and other whistle-blower organisations to disclose cover-ups of the activities of people in power is a sacred project, while conversely the attempts of the nation states and the major corporations to bug and register the views of citizens represent a flagrant violation of universal, human rights. Transparentisation in an increasingly transparent society must quite simply spread from the top down by being switched on from the bottom up. The order must be the following: first the person in power bares himself, then the citizen bares herself. And it is precisely here that the antagonism between the new syntheist netocracy and the old statist-corporatist power structure becomes most apparent. The netocracy regards the Internet as a relationalist phenomenon: to be a netocrat is to identify with the network itself, to act as the Internet’s agent. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, regard the Internet as a correlationist object, alien to and hostile towards the individualist subject and therefore a troubling object that must be tamed and controlled, by force if necessary." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Accordingly, the fight for the free and open Internet is the answer to what must be done; it is the engine that drives the new utopia rather than the brake that hinders the old dystopia. What we are talking about here is far more than just parallel phenomena in the market for the shaping public opinion: syntheism is de facto the name of the digital integrity movement’s underlying metaphysics. This explains why the fight for the free and open Internet is the central political struggle in the 21st century. All other important political conflicts that play out during, and contribute to giving colour to, informationalism’s growth, are completely dependent on how this conflict unfolds. It concerns far more than the growing netocracy’s striving to ignore the ruling bourgeoisie, which has controlled the world since the paradigm of the printing press gained broad acceptance. Beyond the fight for the free and open Internet, the approaching ecological apocalypse is rearing its ugly head: a potential catastrophe that capitalism is responsible for and at the same time evidently lacks the ability to prevent." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is difficult to think of a clearer illustration of how the democratic system de facto has collapsed under late capitalism and has now definitively morphed into a chaotic plurarchy. If an intelligence agency can grab the power from elected representatives, the word democracy loses all meaning. This is no longer about a democracy but about a massive, paranoid bureaucracy that does not need to take into account at all any form of democratic or even judicial influence over how certain State agencies operate. Late capitalism’s obsession with security, which is constantly mistaken for safety, could hardly have been exposed any more clearly.

This applies not least to the country that, more than any other, has acted as the emblem of liberal democracy, the USA. This once proud defender of universal freedom – in pace with an increasing number of hysterical narratives of fabricated external threats having been put forward – has been reduced to a lobby-controlled plurarchy in the hands of religious extremists and intelligence bureaucrats that operate in secret, backed up by interests that represent an enormous and thus depleting drain on resources (such as the NSA). It has gone so far that it is no longer the dream of individual freedom that is the engine in the American identity, but instead the collective paranoia.

Therefore new laws are constantly being produced, new crime classifications, new pathologies, new defects, new failures to rectify, new problems to investigate, which one can later expand on even further, rather than rectify them. Postmodern society offers no catharsis and lacks a narrative of how the capitalist tragedy is to be brought to an end. Capitalism quite simply lacks an exit strategy. Liberal democracy’s dilemma is not primarily that it is based on obsolete individualism – liberalism is individualism’s political ideology par excellence – but rather that it is based on the myth of the invisible hand’s mystical self-regulation. But such a hand does not exist, an unregulated market always moves towards sundry variants of corrupt monopolies or oligopolies as their terminuses. The invisible hand cannot do anything itself to stop this; that can only be done by visible hands. Pragmatism defeats liberalism every day of the week in actual politics.

Such a question of course assumes that we are intimately acquainted with some kind of god who does not exist anyway nor has ever existed, and beforehand at that. The correctly posed syntheological question is instead which god might come to exist, and the answer to this question is always synonymous with the core of the vision that is driving the paradigm in question. The syntheological response runs as follows: Tell me your utopia, and I will tell you what god you are seeking and following.

To solve the temporal credit assignment problem, brains must reinforce behaviors based on changes in predicted future rewards, not actual rewards.

Indeed, it makes sense that dopamine was the neuromodulator that evolution reshaped into a temporal difference learning signal, as the signal for nearby rewards it was the closest thing to a measure of predicted future reward. And so, dopamine was transformed from a good-things-are-nearby signal to a there-is-a-35 percent-chance-of-something-awesome-happening-in-exactly-ten-seconds signal.

Gambling and social feeds work by hacking into our five-hundred-million-year-old preference for surprise, producing a maladaptive edge case that evolution has not had time to account for. Curiosity and reinforcement learning coevolved because curiosity is a requirement for reinforcement learning to work. With the newfound ability to recognize patterns, remember places, and flexibly change behavior based on past rewards and punishments, the first vertebrates were presented with a new opportunity: for the first time, learning became, in and of itself, an extremely valuable activity. The more patterns a vertebrate recognized and the more places she remembered, the better she would survive. And the more new things she tried, the more likely she was to learn the correct contingencies between her actions and their corresponding outcomes.

Just as genes persist by hopping from parent cell to offspring cell, ideas persist by hopping from brain to brain, from generation to generation.

A functional equivalence between the mechanisms driving evolution, learning, and science suggests that adaptation and scientific knowledge are actually the same thing. Biological adaptation represents knowledge of the environment, and the knowledge we acquire through learning and science reflects adaptation to the environment. If you think about it, there really is no meaningful distinction between adaptive information and scientific knowledge—both allow life to predict an uncertain world, control matter, constrain chaos, and construct order from disorder.

> "Realizing that only a conscious entity has the ability to doubt inspired Descartes to make the simple but powerful statement “Cogito, ergo sum,” which roughly translates to “I think, therefore I am.” In other words, the fact that I am having an experience right now means that I—as a conscious observer—must really exist." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "As we’ve established, even the simplest organisms have a primitive form of cognition, which allows them to sense and respond to the surroundings, but we should not mistake agency for consciousness. Agency only requires that a system have a world model—an internally embedded statistical mapping that represents the biologically relevant regularities in the environment. But the mere presence of a world model doesn’t mean that the contents of the model are being experienced by an observer. Subjective experience is always witnessed by a “self,” which forms the seat of a first-person perspective. So, it seems that progress in solving the hard problem of consciousness can be made by identifying the mechanism that brings about an observer with a point of view. What, then, is the source of the self?
>
> According to the cognitive philosopher Douglas Hofstadter, for a point of view to emerge, the agent’s world model must model itself. We call this example of self-reference self-modeling, and for reasons that will soon be explained, it is an ability that would seem to require a brain. If Hofstadter’s model of minds as models with self-models is correct—which he described in qualitative detail in his 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop—we finally have a relatively precise answer for when consciousness comes into the picture as a result of cosmic evolution. Mind, in the full sense of the word, emerges with brain. Self-modeling as the source of self might sound too obvious, but sometimes the answers to problems that appear difficult are staring us in the face.
>
> Want proof that you are an observer with a model of the world and of yourself inside your head? Let’s do the exercise we did in Chapter Six. Close your eyes and try to envision yourself in a room. Zoom out to see your house and your neighborhood from a bird’s-eye view. Zoom out and see the planet Earth from space. Now imagine a friend sitting next to you in your room. You have not only modeled the world in your brain, you have modeled other modelers, and those familiar agents come to life in your dreams, complete with personalities and trademark quirks!
>
> These models of other minds were built up from accumulated experience with those people. While we are all unique individuals, we are also in many ways the sum total of all the minds we have modeled, and without knowing we consult with these other minds when making difficult decisions. For example, you may call on a famous musician you admire when writing a melody for a song, and you may call on a role model when trying to make a decision about your future, like a parent or an influential teacher you once had, without any real conscious thought or reflection.
>
> These agents need not be real agents that we’ve encountered in reality either. The popular saying “What would Jesus do?” reveals that Christians who ask this question have modeled their deity and look to that model for advice, support, and existential insight. The same goes for every other religion, and when we realize this, we see why there can be practical benefits to modeling abstract entities that have useful characteristics or properties. This general process has been called “thinking through other minds” by the same researchers who have applied the Bayesian brain hypothesis/free-energy principle to high-level hierarchical systems beyond brains, like ecosystems and societies.
>
> Friston and colleagues Maxwell Ramstead, director of research at the Spatial Web Foundation in California, and cognitive scientist Samuel Veissière at McGill University in Montreal have argued that the process of inferring other agents’ beliefs and expectations about the world informs us on how to behave in social situations and brings stability to society by coordinating collective behavior.
>
> Now imagine yourself in your room, and try to stare at yourself from above. How do you look? This is proof that you’ve modeled yourself as well. Pretty loopy, right? Now ask yourself, how accurate is your model of you?" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Hofstadter believes that the self, the I, the conscious observer, has true causal power on the world. He also gives us a vague but powerful insight into how this observer capable of causation comes into existence. By his account, the self emerges from self-reference “via a kind of vortex whereby patterns in a brain mirror the brain’s mirroring of the world, and eventually mirror themselves, whereupon the vortex of ‘I’ becomes a real, causal entity.”" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Details aside, the brain generates conscious experience when coordinated global activity emerges from the local electrical interactions of billions of neurons—the synchronous firing of those neurons integrates information from multiple processing streams into a single field of experience. It is not that synchronous firing of any kind produces conscious states, as we also see long-range synchronies with epilepsy. So, it is more careful to say that coordinated global firing at a particular synchrony (thought to be ~40 Hz) is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. This global activity is made possible by a phenomenon we are now quite familiar with, thanks to cybernetics: feedback. Feedback loops running from the thalamus to the cortex—so-called thalamo-cortical loops—integrate information and bind features into a cohesive perceptual landscape.
>
> When does consciousness disappear? When the feedback loops disappear, because it is these loops that entrain the activity of the component parts, bringing about the global integration of information. Whenever there is feedback, there is some form of self-reference at play, and in brains, it can be a signature of self-modeling. Without feedback, the brain still functions as a physiological organ controlling autonomic functions, but consciousness fades into nonexistence. We know the mental model is still encoded in the neuronal architecture of the brain, but what disappears is the observer, the self, which comes from the self-reference we get from real-time self-modeling. When the strange loop is disrupted—the multilevel feedback loop that mirrors itself—consciousness fades. So, the mind should no longer be thought of as a nonphysical entity moving things around; it is a multilevel cybernetic controller with causal power over itself and its environment." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Global neuronal workspace theory proposes a computational model for how separate processing streams are integrated into a unified conscious perception through emergent synchronous activity that produces a “global workspace.” If the global workspace is the mental workspace that we call the conscious mind, how exactly is that workspace created?
>
> We can answer that question by recognizing that the workspace corresponds to a neural attractor, and loops are obviously involved in the formation and maintenance of any attractor. It is specifically fronto-parietal loops that create the global workspace—or loops between functionally connected regions in the frontal lobes and the parietal lobes. When the activity of neurons in these areas become coordinated past a certain critical threshold, waves of global order propagate through the network, synchronous brain-wide firing occurs, and a global attractor of persistent electrical activity emerges from a phase transition that Dehaene calls an “ignition event.”
>
> This phase transition in the brain broadcasts the information in the global workspace to other neural modules that typically process information separately, leading to what Daniel Dennett calls “fame in the brain.” Now the information in the conscious representation is available for all kinds of additional processing not possible without the global workspace. Specifically, information in the workspace becomes the focus of selective attention, and its contents can be manipulated by working memory, or it can be used to make high-level decisions that the brain has no stored solution for. Planning and imagination are also made possible by the global workspace, which momentarily subsumes those independently working systems into the neural attractor, allowing minds to do things that can’t be done without consciousness, like running mental simulations of possible futures in order to select the one that is most desirable. Why should we think the global workspace has something to do with self-modeling? Because, again, we see feedback loops, and when the loops disappear, so does the mental workspace. Conscious processing of globally available information is disrupted and higher-level cognition dissipates.
>
> So, the neuroscience suggests that Hofstadter is right. It is the causal loops running across levels that create consciousness, what neuroscientist Anil Seth characterizes as a “controlled hallucination,” which is a step up from “illusion,” as Dennett described it in his landmark 1991 book Consciousness Explained." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "A sentient system must have a cohesive model of the world, built up through interaction with it, and that world model must include a model of the system doing the modeling." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "In this way, the continuation of cosmic evolution toward higher complexity and greater knowledge crucially depends on intelligent agents that can and will exercise free will. It is the power to simulate counterfactuals, or “what if” scenarios, that will illuminate the causal path that is consistent with the continued persistence of life in the cosmos. By using our conscious mind to imagine the future implied by an open-ended evolutionary process, we can see that intelligence-aided recursive self-organization will continually add new levels to the growing hierarchy of life and mind, making metasystems of increasing computational complexity, causal power, and self-referential richness. That gives us a duty to fulfill as sentient citizens of the cosmos.
>
> In the model of reality proposed by poetic meta-naturalism, there is room for destiny and free will. Because the future is not determined in the strict sense imagined by Laplace, there is no paradox. As individuals, we are truly free to choose our future path, but because it is in our nature to try and survive, our actions are not random; they are directed toward a goal, a goal that we all share as living agents. This shared goal—evading equilibrium—harmonizes our collective activity, and because human civilization learns from its mistakes, progress becomes inevitable.
>
> Since cosmic evolution inexorably generates increasingly robust and powerful multilevel cybernetic control systems, the emergence and outward expansion of intelligence in the cosmos was predestined, but in a completely natural sense of the word, as Christian de Duve, Freeman Dyson, Harold Morowitz, Ray Kurzweil, Christof Koch, and other renaissance men of science have argued. The freedom is at the level of the agent who exercises conscious causal control, not the aggregate behavior of humanity, which settles into increasingly stable and integrated attractors as knowledge accumulates in cultural memory." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "If we are to take the idea of multiple realizability (substrate independence) seriously, then minds can be realized on different mediums and on different scales, as long as the relevant causal and computational mechanisms are duplicated in brain-like hardware. If this is true, we must entertain the idea that an information-processing system like the internet, which in this definition includes the humans it connects, can possess conscious states similar to those generated by a biological nervous system. As long as information is being integrated by feedback loops that generate models of the world and the self—in this case, the “self” being the system that is the global brain—mind will presumably emerge." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Cosmic teleology is a worldview that recognizes the goal-directed nature of our universe, a dynamical system that is becoming increasingly complex and sentient as time moves forward and natural processes play out. The cosmic teleology presented in this book is an entirely natural teleology—specifically an evolutionary-computational teleology that is fully compatible with the laws of physics—and a scientifically rigorous theory, as it can be described in quantitative terms and makes testable predictions.
>
> Because in the past the word “teleology” has sometimes been associated with a religious belief in a supernatural or mystical force that guides evolution toward progress, the label will undoubtedly bother some skeptics and atheists who have an aversion to religion. But this should not deter us from using the most appropriate and recognizable terminology. It is worth reiterating that the cosmic self-organization process being described here is entirely mechanistic—a sort of “blind groping” toward an increasingly complex state, driven by the universe’s proclivity to process information and accumulate knowledge in the architecture of adaptive complexity. It is not guided by any external force or metaphysical entity; functional organization is internally generated from the physical laws and the evolutionary dynamics that emerge from the constraints those laws impose on matter in motion." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "A modern cosmic teleology—a computational or Darwinian teleology—eliminates all “explanatory gaps” in the evolutionary story, shattering the creationist’s claim of “irreducible complexity,” and in turn putting the nail in the coffin for any “intelligent design” theories that invoke the supernatural to explain life’s origin. But reducing the teleological development of the cosmos to a series of natural mechanisms does not explain away the mystery of why we find ourselves in a self-organizing world that becomes increasingly self-aware and computationally powerful through a series of inevitable emergences. We no longer have “irreducible complexity” in the creationist’s sense, but we have irreducible emergent phenomena like life and consciousness, which can’t be explained away reductively—that is, in terms of atoms following fixed trajectories—without losing something critical in the explanation." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "We have a responsibility to do what is good for the living network, which includes not only humans but all sentient life, as well as the biosphere, since life critically depends on entire ecosystems for survival. If we care about the futures of our children, and their children, such a task is a moral obligation. If we want to see a universe that isn’t cold and lifeless, but increasingly sentient and creative, then it is also a spiritual obligation.
>
> Many assume that when you get down to the nuts and bolts of nature, a spiritual worldview is simply incompatible with a scientific one. While that is the common assumption, it couldn’t be more wrong. Spirituality simply refers to a sense of connection to something larger than oneself, and it has nothing to do with the supernatural. To quote Carl Sagan again, “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.”9 Einstein not only shared this view but also believed that the only path to true spiritual enlightenment was the trail we travel along when we pursue scientific discovery. “The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.”10" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "“Religion” is another a loaded term, but a spiritual ideology that is guided by science and aided by technology, that has a universal morality and a shared existential goal, will be the worldview of the future. It has to be if we want our civilization to survive. Under the cosmic perspective, there is no “us versus them,” there’s only “we.” Since we’re all part of an interdependent whole, our goal should be to try to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Knowledge is enlightenment, knowledge is transcendence, and knowledge is power. The tendency toward disorder described by the second law requires that life acquire knowledge forever, giving us all an individual and collective purpose by creating the constraint that forces us to create.

> "All progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal, cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations.

If elites choose to dig in, they are likely to resort to repression. To avoid these extreme outcomes, both elites and the public have to change. Elites will have to cede authority and permit more local variation and experimentation. The public will have to be more tolerant. Imperfections and bad outcomes should not be taken as proof of conspiracy or evil intent. We should pay less heed to those who only can pour out condemnation and blame.

Famous landmarks of the old regime, like the daily newspaper and the political party, have begun to disintegrate under the pressure of this slow-motion collision. Many features we prized about the old world are also threatened: for example, liberal democracy and economic stability. Some of them will emerge permanently distorted by the stress.

Hierarchy has ruled the world since the human race attained meaningful numbers. The industrial mind just made it bigger, steeper, and more efficient. From the era of Rameses to that of Hosni Mubarak, it has exhibited predictable patterns of behavior: top-down, centralizing, painfully deliberate in action, process- obsessed, mesmerized by grand strategies and five-year plans, respectful of rank and order but contemptuous of the outsider, the amateur.

Nothing within the bounds of human nature could be less like a hierarchy. Where the latter is slow and plodding, networked action is lightning quick but unsteady in purpose. Where hierarchy has evolved a hard exoskeleton to keep every part in place, the network is loose and pliable—it can swell into millions or dissipate in an instant.

A significant fraction of the public must find the status quo acceptable, and the larger the number of true believers, the more solid the foundation underneath a regime.

Most significantly, the regime in its blindness fails to adjust its story of legitimacy to make it plausible in a crowded, fiercely competitive environment.

This is how H. informaticus experiences the changed environment: as an Amazonian flood of irreverent, controversy-ridden, anti-authority content, including direct criticism of the regime.
>
> The consequences are predictable and irreversible. The regime accumulates pain points: police brutality, economic mismanagement, foreign policy failures, botched responses to disasters. These problems can no longer be concealed or explained away. Instead, they are seized on by the newly-empowered public, and placed front-and-center in open discussions. In essence, government failure now sets the agenda.

> As the regime’s story of legitimacy becomes less and less persuasive, Homo informaticus adjusts his story of the world in opposition to that of the regime. He joins the ranks of similarly disaffected members of the public, who are hostile to the status quo, eager to pick fights with authority, and seek the means to broadcast their opinions and turn the tables on their rulers.

> The means of communication are of course provided by the information sphere. The unit of broadcasting can be a single individual—a Hoder, a Wael Ghonim, any member of the public, including Homo informaticus. The level of reach is billions, distributed across the face of the world.

> At this stage, the public, clustered around networked communities of interest, has effectively taken control of the means of communication. Vital communities revolve around favorite themes and channels, which in the aggregate reveal the true tastes of the public, as opposed to what mass media, corporations, or governments wish the public to be interested in.
>
> Under authoritarian governments, vital communities will tend to coalesce in political opposition as they bump into regime surveillance and control. The regime still controls the apparatus of repression. It can deny service, physically attack, imprison, or even kill H. informaticus—but it can’t silence his message, because this message is constantly amplified and propagated by the opposition community. Since the opposition commands the means of communication and is embedded in the global information sphere, its voice carries beyond the reach of any national government.

> This was the situation in Egypt before the uprising of January 25, 2011. This is the situation in China today. The wealth and brute strength of the modern state are counterbalanced by the vast communicative powers of the public. Filters are placed on web access, police agents monitor suspect websites, foreign newscasters are blocked, domestic bloggers are harassed and thrown in jail—but every incident which tears away at the legitimacy of the regime is seized on by a rebellious public, and is then broadcast and magnified until criticism goes viral.

This is the situation today for authoritarian governments and liberal democracies alike. The crisis in the world that I seek to depict concerns loss of trust in government, writ large. The mass extinction of stories of legitimacy leaves no margin for error, no residual store of public good will. Any spark can blow up any political system at any time, anywhere.

> "Propaganda was the totalitarian’s admission that his power wasn’t total. Unlike democratic politicians, leaders of mass movements lacked feedback mechanisms: they had no idea what the masses were thinking, and could only hope to inject the desired opinions directly into the brains of their followers." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "My story—I repeat—concerns the tectonic collision between a public which will not rule and institutions of authority progressively less able to do so. My misgiving is that democracy will be ground to pieces under the stress. An immense psychological distance separates the two sides, even as they come together in conflict. This gulf is filled with dark matter: distrust. The elites who control the institutions have never really trusted the public, which they considered animalistic and prone to bouts of destructiveness. In effect, they sought to neuter the public by herding it into a mass and attaching it to established hierarchies. A glimpse at any American airport today will confirm that this horror of the top for the bottom has, if anything, grown more intense. What has changed, then, is the public’s distrust for authority—and its increased power, in the age of the Fifth Wave, to translate that distrust into action." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

When the crisis arrives, they are slow to grasp its dimensions. When the effects become palpable, they reflexively reach for the crude tools they have at their disposal, whether or not these will improve the situation. In essence, governments can throw money at unwanted change, or they can hurl bombs and policemen." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Like money and marriage, legitimacy exists objectively because vast numbers of the public agree, subjectively, that it does exist.

> "Authority, as I use the term, flows from legitimacy, derived from monopoly. To some indeterminate degree, the public must trust and heed authority, or it is no authority at all. An important social function of authority is to deliver certainty in an uncertain world. It explains reality in the context of the shared story of the group. For this it must rely on persuasion rather than compulsion, since naked force is a destroyer of trust and faith. The need to persuade in turn explains the institutional propensity for visible symbols of authority—the patrician’s toga, the doctor’s white frock, the financier’s Armani suit. Authority being an intangible quality, those who wield it wish to be recognized for what they are. And they have been, historically, the only actors in the social drama, with the public relegated to the audience, able only to weep or applaud. Authority is an expansion of author, which originally meant something like “initiator”—the active human element in an otherwise inert population. Current structures of authority are a legacy of the industrial age. The public, when it needs answers, turns to institutions rather than to charismatic individuals. These institutions have been subjected to a Taylorist process of rationalization: they are, without exception, top-down, specialized, professionalized, prone to pseudo-scientific rituals and jargon. To enter such a precinct of authority requires a long and costly accreditation process—years of academic education and apprenticeship. Many are called, few are chosen. The elect believe themselves to be unquestioned masters of their special domain— and so they were for many years. From the middle of the nineteenth to the end of the twentieth centuries, the public lacked the means to question, much less contradict, authoritative judgments derived from monopolies of information. Most people in authority today came to their positions in that happy time. On moral as well as intellectual grounds, they dismiss the outsider out of hand. Their reflexive loathing of the amateur trespasser inspired Hoder’s 19½-year sentence and the mutual annihilation lawsuits against Shawn Fanning and Napster. Of course, the ferocity of this response can be explained in part by a fear of losing access to power and money. Authority has been closely associated with both—it’s a natural connection. Power needs accurate intelligence on which to act. Monopoly has always been a position from which to exploit the market. If I stop thinking in generalities and imagine a concrete person in authority, I’ll conjure up a policeman, a politician, a banker. The links between authority on one side and power and money on the other are dense and often invisible to the public. But each exerts a discrete influence on social relations, and of the three, I believe authority to be easily the most consequential. Even in purely practical terms, persuasion has always trumped compulsion or bribery. The authorizing magic of legitimacy can channel social behavior more deeply and permanently than the policeman’s club or the millionaire’s check. These propositions should be considered truisms, but they are not. Not by the public, which, as we have seen, assumes that every failure of authority must be explained by a collusion of money with power...

> When asked about the impact of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai was supposed to have responded: “It is too soon to say.” In that one instance, if true, Zhou spoke as an honest political analyst rather than a revolutionary prophet. The crisis of authority hollowing out existing institutions didn’t arise because these institutions prostituted themselves to power or money. That was an explanation after the fact—one that happened to be believed by much of the public and many experts. The fact that needed to be explained, however, was failure: the painfully visible gap between the institutions’ claims of competence and their actual performance. The gap, I maintain, was a function of the limits of human knowledge. It had always been there. What changed was the public’s awareness of it. In the industrial age, the pratfalls of authority had been managed discreetly, camouflaged by the mystique of the expert at the top of his game. Today failure happens out in the open, in public, where everyone can see. With the arrival of the global information sphere, each failure is captured, reproduced, multiplied, amplified, and made to stand for authority as a whole. Crisis has followed logically from the destruction of the persuasive power—the legitimacy and credibility—possessed by established institutions. The focus of this book has been on politics, because I am personally concerned about the future of democracy, but also because I was an analyst of political events for most of my life. That was my own special domain. But I could just as well have made the precarious future of scientific institutions or the universities the overarching theme of my book. The battleground is everywhere. The assault on authority has expanded to virtually every point in the social landscape where an established hierarchy confronts a public in command of the new platforms of communication." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

The world cannot be run by such a minority of escaped and re-educated minds alone, with all the rest of the heap against them.

> But hitherto religion has never been presented simply as a devotion to a universal cause. The devotion has always been in it, but it has been complicated by other considerations. The leaders in every great religious movement have considered it necessary that it should explain itself in the form of history and a cosmogony. It has been felt necessary to say Why? and To what end? Every religion therefore has had to adopt the physical conceptions, and usually also to assume many of the moral and social values, current at the time of its formation. It could not transcend the philosophical phrases and attitudes that seemed then to supply the natural frame for a faith, nor draw upon anything beyond the store of scientific knowledge of its time.

We have to get clear of that clutter. The reasonable desire of all of us is that we should have the collective affairs of the world managed by suitably equipped groups of the most interested, intelligent, and devoted people, and that their activities should be subjected to a free, open, watchful criticism, restrained from making spasmodic interruptions but powerful enough to modify or supersede without haste or delay whatever is weakening or unsatisfactory in the general direction.
>
> A number of readers will be disposed to say that this is a very vague, undefined, and complicated conception of world government. But indeed it is a simplification. Not only are the present governments of the world a fragmentary competitive confusion, but none of them is as simple as it appears. They seem to be simple because they have formal heads and definite forms, councils, voting assemblies, and so forth, for arriving at decisions. But the formal heads, the kings, presidents, and so forth, are really not the directive heads. They are merely the figure heads. They do not decide. They merely make gestures of potent and dignified acquiescence when decisions are put to them. They are complicating shams. Nor do the councils and assemblies really decide. They record, often very imperfectly and exasperatingly, the accumulating purpose of outer forces. These outer really directive forces are no doubt very intricate in their operation; they depend finally on religious and educational forms and upon waves of gregarious feeling, but it does not in the least simplify the process of collective human activity to pretend that it is simple and to set up symbols and dummies in the guise of rulers and dictators to embody that pretence. To recognize the incurable intricacy of collective action is a mental simplification; to remain satisfied with the pretensions of existing governmental institutions, and to bring in all the problems of their procedure and interaction is to complicate the question.
>
> The present rudimentary development of collective psychology obliges us to be vague and provisional about the way in which the collective mind may best define its will for the purpose of administrative action. We may know that a thing is possible and still be unable to do it as yet, just as we knew that aviation was possible in 1900. Some method of decision there must certainly be and a definite administrative machinery. But it may turn out to be a much slighter, less elaborate organization than a consideration of existing methods might lead us to imagine. It may never become one single interlocking administrative system. We may have systems of world control rather than a single world state. The practical regulations, enforcements, and officials needed to keep the world in good health, for example may be only very loosely related to the system of controls that will maintain its communications in a state of efficiency. Enforcement and legal decisions, as we know them now, may be found to be enormously and needlessly cumbrous by our descendants. As the reasonableness of a thing is made plain, the need for its enforcement is diminished, and the necessity for litigation disappears.

> The Open Conspiracy, the world movement for the supercession or enlargement or fusion of existing political, economic, and social institutions must necessarily, as it grows, draw closer and closer to questions of practical control. It is likely in its growth to incorporate many active public servants and many industrial and financial leaders and directors. It may assimilate great masses of intelligent workers. As its activities spread it will work out a whole system of special methods of co-operation. As it grows, and by growing, it will learn the business of general direction and how to develop its critical function. A lucid, dispassionate, and immanent criticism is the primary necessity, the living spirit of a world civilization. The Open Conspiracy is essentially such a criticism, and the carrying out of such a criticism into working reality is the task of the Open Conspiracy. It will by its very nature be aiming not so much to set up a world direction, as to become itself a world direction, and the educational and militant forms of its opening phase will evoke, step by step, as experience is gained and power and responsibility acquired, forms of administration and research and correlation." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

> "But as soon as this time-honoured preoccupation with the allotment of the shares of originators, organizers, workers, owners of material, credit dealers, and tax collectors in the total product, ceases to be dealt with as the primary question in economics; as soon as we liberate our minds from a preoccupation which from the outset necessarily makes that science a squabble rather than a science, and begin our attack upon the subject with a survey of the machinery and other productive material required in order that the staple needs of mankind should be satisfied, if we go on from that to consider the way in which all this material and machinery can be worked and the product distributed with the least labour and the greatest possible satisfaction, we shift our treatment of economic questions towards standards by which all current methods of exploitation, employment, and finance can be judged rather than wrangled over. We can dismiss the question of the claims of this sort of participant or that, for later and subordinate consideration, and view each variety of human assistance in the general effort entirely from the standpoint of what makes that assistance least onerous and most effective.
>
> The germs of such really scientific economics exist already in the study of industrial organization and industrial psychology. As the science of industrial psychology in particular develops, we shall find all this discussion of ownership, profit, wages, finance, and accumulation, which has been treated hitherto as the primary issues of economics, falling into place under the larger enquiry of what conventions in these matters, what system of money and what conceptions of property, yield the greatest stimulus and the least friction in that world-wide system of co-operation which must constitute the general economic basis to the activities of a unified mankind.
>
> Manifestly the supreme direction of the complex of human economic activities in such a world must centre upon a bureau of information and advice, which will take account of all the resources of the planet, estimate current needs, apportion productive activities and control distribution. The topographical and geological surveys of modern civilized communities, their government maps, their periodic issue of agricultural and industrial statistics, are the first crude and unco-ordinated beginnings of such an economic world intelligence. In the propaganda work of David Lubin, a pioneer whom mankind must not forget, and in his International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, there were the beginnings of an impartial review month by month and year by year of world production, world needs and world transport. Such a great central organization of economic science would necessarily produce direction; it would indicate what had best be done here, there, and everywhere, solve general tangles, examine, approve and initiate fresh methods and arrange the transitional process from old to new. It would not be an organization of will, imposing its will upon a reluctant or recalcitrant race; it would be a direction, just as a map is a direction.
>
> A map imposes no will on anyone, breaks no one in to its "policy." And yet we obey our maps.
>
> The will to have the map full, accurate, and up to date, and the determination to have its indications respected, would have to pervade the whole community. To nourish and sustain that will must be the task not of any particular social or economic division of the community, but of the whole body of right-minded people in that community. The organization and preservation of that power of will is the primary undertaking, therefore, of a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity. And through that will it will produce as the central organ the brain of the modern community, a great encyclopædic organization, kept constantly up to date and giving approximate estimates and directions for all the material activities of mankind.
>
> The older and still prevalent conception of government is bullying, is the breaking-in and subjugation of the "subject," to the God, or king, or lords of the community. Will-bending, the overcoming of the recalcitrant junior and inferior, was an essential process in the establishment of primitive societies, and its tradition still rules our education and law. No doubt there must be a necessary accommodation of the normal human will to every form of society; no man is innately virtuous; but compulsion and restraint are the friction of the social machine and, other things being equal, the less compulsive social arrangements are, the more willingly, naturally, and easily they are accepted, the less wasteful of moral effort and the happier that community will be. The ideal state, other things being equal, is the state with the fewest possible number of will fights and will suppressions. This must be a primary consideration in arranging the economic, biological, and mental organization of the world community at which we aim.
>
> We have advanced the opinion that the control of population pressure is practicable without any violent conflict with "human nature," that given a proper atmosphere of knowledge and intention, there need be far less suppression of will in relation to production than prevails to-day. In the same way, it is possible that the general economic life of mankind may be made universally satisfactory that there may be an abundance out of all comparison greater than the existing supply of things necessary for human well-being, freedom, and activity, with not merely not more, but infinitely less subjugation and enslavement than now occurs. Man is still but half born out of the blind struggle for existence, and his nature still partakes of the infinite wastefulness of his mother Nature. He has still to learn how to price the commodities he covets in terms of human life. He is indeed only beginning to realize that there is anything to be learnt in that matter. He wastes will and human possibility extravagantly in his current economic methods.

> We know nowadays that the nineteenth century expended a great wealth of intelligence upon a barren controversy between Individualism and Socialism. They were treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, instead of being questions of degree. Human society has been is and always must be an intricate system of adjustments between unconditional liberty and the disciplines and subordinations of co-operative enterprise. Affairs do not move simply from a more individualist to a more socialist state or vice versa; there may be a release of individual initiative going on here and standardization or restraint increasing there. Personal property never can be socially guaranteed as the extremer individualists desired, nor can it be "abolished" as the extremer socialists proposed. Property is not robbery, as Proudhon asserted; it is the protection of things against promiscuous and mainly wasteful use. Property is not necessarily personal. In some cases property may restrict or forbid a use of things that could be generally advantageous, and it may be and is frequently unfair in its assignment of initiative, but the remedy for that is not an abolition but a revision of property. In the concrete it is a form necessary for liberty of action upon material, while abstracted as money, which is a liquidated generalized form of property; it is a ticket for individual liberty of movement and individual choice of reward.
>
> The economic history of mankind is a history of the operation of the idea of property; it relates the conflict of the unlimited acquisitiveness of egoistic individuals against the resentment of the disinherited and unsuccessful and the far less effective consciousness of a general welfare. Money grew out of a system of abstracting conventions and has been subjected to a great variety of restrictions, monopolizations, and regulations. It has never been an altogether logical device, and it has permitted the most extensive and complex developments of credit, debt, and dispossession. All these developments have brought with them characteristic forms of misuse and corruption. The story is intricate, and the tangle of relationships, of dependence, of pressure, of interception, of misdirected services, crippling embarrassments, and crushing obligations in which we live to-day admits of no such simple and general solutions as many exponents of socialism, for example, seem to consider possible.

> But the thought and investigations of the past century or so have made it clear that a classification of property, according to the nature of the rights exercisable and according to the range of ownership involved, must be the basis of any system of social justice in the future.
>
> Certain things, the ocean, the air, rare wild animals, must be the collective property of all mankind and cannot be altogether safe until they are so regarded, and until some concrete body exists to exercise these proprietary rights. Whatever collective control exists must protect these universal properties, the sea from derelicts, the strange shy things of the wild from extermination by the hunter and the foolish collector. The extinction of many beautiful creatures is one of the penalties our world is paying for its sluggishness in developing a collective common rule. And there are many staple things and general needs that now also demand a unified control in the common interest. The raw material of the earth should be for all, not to be monopolized by any acquisitive individual or acquisitive sovereign state, and not to be withheld from exploitation for the general benefit of any chance claims to territorial priority of this or that backward or bargaining person or tribe.
>
> In the past, most of these universal concerns have had to be left to the competitive enterprise of profit-seeking individuals because there were as yet no collectivities organized to the pitch of ability needed to develop and control these concerns, but surely nobody in his senses believes that the supply and distribution of staple commodities about the earth by irresponsible persons and companies working entirely for monetary gain is the best possible method from the point of view of the race as a whole. The land of the earth, all utilizable natural products, have fallen very largely under the rules and usages of personal property because in the past that was the only recognized and practicable form of administrative proprietorship. The development both of extensive proprietary companies and of government departments with economic functions has been a matter of the last few centuries, the development, that is to say, of communal, more or less impersonal ownership, and it is only through these developments that the idea of organized collectivity of proprietorship has become credible.
>
> ...
>
> But when we have stipulated for the replacement of individual private ownership by more highly organized forms of collective ownership, subject to free criticism and responsible to the whole republic of mankind, in the general control of sea and land, in the getting, preparation, and distribution of staple products and in transport, we have really named all the possible generalizations of concrete ownership that the most socialistic of contemporaries will be disposed to demand. And if we add to that the necessary maintenance of a money system by a central world authority upon a basis that will make money keep faith with the worker who earns it, and represent from first to last for him the value in staple commodities he was given to understand it was to have, and if we conceive credit adequately controlled in the general interest by a socialized world banking organization, we shall have defined the entire realm from which individual property and unrestricted individual enterprise have been excluded. Beyond that, the science of social psychology will probably assure us that the best work will be done for the world by individuals free to exploit their abilities as they wish. If the individual landowner or mineral-owner disappears altogether from the world, he will probably be replaced over large areas by tenants with considerable security of tenure, by householders and by licensees under collective proprietors. It will be the practice, the recognized best course, to allow the cultivator to profit as fully as possible by his own individual productivity and to leave the householder to fashion his house and garden after his own desire.
>
> Such in the very broadest terms is the character of the world commonweal towards which the modern imagination is moving, so far as its direction and economic life are concerned. The organization of collective bodies capable of exercising these wider proprietorships, which cannot be properly used in the common interest by uncorrelated individual owners, is the positive practical problem before the intelligent portion of mankind to-day. The nature of such collective bodies is still a series of open questions, even upon such points as whether they will be elected bodies or groups deriving their authority from other sanctions. Their scope and methods of operation, their relations to one another and to the central bureau of intelligence, remain also to be defined. But before we conclude this essay we may be able to find precisions for at least the beginning of such definition.
>
> Nineteenth-century socialism in its various forms, including the highly indurated formulae of communism, has been a series of projects for the establishment of such collective controls, for the most part very sketchy projects from which the necessary factor of a sound psychological analysis was almost completely wanting. Primarily movements of protest and revolt against the blazing injustices arising out of the selfishly individualistic exploitation of the new and more productive technical and financial methods of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they have been apt to go beyond the limits of reasonable socialization in their demands and to minimize absurdly the difficulties and dangers of collective control. Indignation and impatience were their ruling moods, and if they constructed little they exposed much. We are better able to measure the magnitude of the task before us because of the clearances and lessons achieved by these pioneer movements." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

We believe that the persistent exploration of our outward and inward worlds by scientific and artistic endeavour will lead to developments of power and activity upon which at present we can set no limits nor give any certain form." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

> "THIS open and declared intention of establishing a world order out of the present patchwork of particularist governments, of effacing the militarist conceptions that have hitherto given governments their typical form, and of removing credit and the broad fundamental processes of economic life out of reach of private profit-seeking and individual monopolization, which is the substance of this Open Conspiracy to which the modern religious mind must necessarily address its practical activities, cannot fail to arouse enormous opposition. It is not a creative effort in a clear field; it is a creative effort that can hardly stir without attacking established things. It is the repudiation of drift, of "leaving things alone." It criticizes everything in human life from the top to the bottom and finds everything not good enough. It strikes at the universal human desire to feel that things are "all right."
>
> One might conclude, and it would be a hasty, unsound conclusion, that the only people to whom we could look for sympathy and any passionate energy in forwarding the revolutionary change would be the unhappy, the discontented, the dispossessed, and the defeated in life's struggle. This idea lies at the root of the class-war dogmas of the Marxists, and it rests on an entirely crude conception of human nature. The successful minority is supposed to have no effective motive but a desire to retain and intensify its advantages. A quite imaginary solidarity to that end is attributed to it, a preposterous, base class activity. On the other hand, the unsuccessful mass—"proletariat"—is supposed to be capable of a clear apprehension of its disadvantages, and the more it is impoverished and embittered, the clearer-minded it becomes, and the nearer draws its uprising, its constructive "dictatorship," and the Millennium.
>
> No doubt a considerable amount of truth is to be found in this theory of the Marxist revolution. Human beings, like other animals, are disposed to remain where their circumstances are tolerable and to want change when they are uncomfortable, and so a great proportion of the people who are "well off" want little or no change in present conditions, particularly those who are too dull to be bored by an unprogressive life, while a great proportion of those who actually feel the inconveniences of straitened means and population pressure, do. But much vaster masses of the rank and file of humanity are accustomed to inferiority and dispossession, they do not feel these things to the extent even of desiring change, or even if they do feel their disadvantages, they still fear change more than they dislike their disadvantages. Moreover, those who are sufficiently distressed to realize that "something ought to be done about it" are much more disposed to childish and threatening demands upon heaven and the government for redress and vindictive and punitive action against the envied fortunate with whom they happen to be in immediate contact, than to any reaction towards such complex, tentative, disciplined constructive work as alone can better the lot of mankind. In practice Marxism is found to work out in a ready resort to malignantly destructive activities, and to be so uncreative as to be practically impotent in the face of material difficulties. In Russia, where—in and about the urban centres, at least—Marxism has been put to the test, the doctrine of the Workers' Republic remains as a unifying cant, a test of orthodoxy of as little practical significance there as the communism of Jesus and communion with Christ in Christendom, while beneath this creed a small oligarchy which has attained power by its profession does its obstinate best, much hampered by the suspicion and hostility of the Western financiers and politicians, to carry on a series of interesting and varyingly successful experiments in the socialization of economic life. Here we have no scope to discuss the N.E.P. and the Five Year Plan. They are dealt with in The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind. Neither was properly Communist. The Five Year Plan is carried out as an autocratic state capitalism. Each year shows more and more clearly that Marxism and Communism are divagations from the path of human progress and that the line of advance must follow a course more intricate and less flattering to the common impulses of our nature.

> The one main strand of truth in the theory of social development woven by Marx and Engels is that successful, comfortable people are disposed to dislike, obstruct and even resist actively any substantial changes in the current patchwork of arrangements, however great the ultimate dangers of that patchwork may be or the privations and sufferings of other people involved in it. The one main strand of error in that theory is the facile assumption that the people at a disadvantage will be stirred to anything more than chaotic and destructive expressions of resentment. If now we reject the error and accept the truth, we lose the delusive comfort of belief in that magic giant, the Proletariat, who will dictate, arrange, restore, and create, but we clear the way for the recognition of an élite of intelligent, creative-minded people scattered through the whole community, and for a study of the method of making this creative element effective in human affairs against the massive oppositions of selfishness and unimaginative self-protective conservatism.

> Now, certain classes of people such as thugs and burglars seem to be harmful to society without a redeeming point about them, and others, such as racecourse bookmakers, seem to provide the minimum of distraction and entertainment with a maximum of mischief. Wilful idlers are a mere burthen on the community. Other social classes again, professional soldiers, for example, have a certain traditional honourableness which disguises the essentially parasitic relationship of their services to the developing modern community. Armies and armaments are cancers produced by the malignant development of the patriotic virus under modern conditions of exaggeration and mass suggestion. But since there are armies prepared to act coercively in the world to-day, it is necessary that the Open Conspiracy should develop within itself the competence to resist military coercion and combat and destroy armies that stand in the way of its emergence. Possibly the first two types here instanced may be condemned as classes and excluded as classes from any participation in the organized effort to recast the world, but quite obviously the soldier cannot. The world commonweal will need its own scientific methods of protection so long as there are people running about the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons, offering violence to their fellow men and interfering with the free movements of commodities in the name of national sovereignty.
>
> And when we come to the general functioning classes, landowners, industrial organizers, bankers, and so forth, who control the present system, such as it is, it should be still plainer that it is very largely from the ranks of these classes, and from their stores of experience and traditions of method, that the directive forces of the new order must emerge. The Open Conspiracy can have nothing to do with the heresy that the path of human progress lies through an extensive class war.
>
> Let us consider, for example, how the Open Conspiracy stands to such a complex of activities, usages, accumulations, advantages as constitutes the banking world. There are no doubt many bankers and many practices in banking which make for personal or group advantage to the general detriment. They forestall, monopolize, constrain, and extort, and so increase their riches. And another large part of that banking world follows routine and established usage; it is carrying on and keeping things going, and it is neither inimical nor conducive to the development of a progressive world organization of finance. But there remains a residuum of original and intelligent people in banking or associated with banking or mentally interested in banking, who do realize that banking plays a very important, interesting part in the world's affairs, who are curious about their own intricate function and disposed towards a scientific investigation of its origins, conditions, and future possibilities. Such types move naturally towards the Open Conspiracy. Their enquiries carry them inevitably outside the bankers' habitual field to an examination of the nature, drift, and destiny of the entire economic process.
>
> Now the theme of the preceding paragraph might be repeated with variations through a score of paragraphs in which appropriate modifications would adapt it to the industrial organizer, the merchant and organizer of transport, the advertiser, the retail distributor, the agriculturalist, the engineer, the builder, the economic chemist, and a number of other types functional in the contemporary community. In all we should distinguish firstly a base and harmful section, then a mediocre section following established usage, and lastly, an active, progressive section to whom we turn naturally for developments leading towards the progressive world commonweal of our desires. And our analysis might penetrate further than separation into types of individuals. In nearly every individual instance we should find a mixed composition, a human being of fluctuating moods and confused purposes, sometimes base, sometimes drifting with the tide and sometimes alert and intellectually and morally quickened. The Open Conspiracy must be content to take a fraction of a man, as it appeals to fractions of many classes, if it cannot get him altogether.
>
> This idea of drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection is a fairly obvious one—and yet it has still to win practical recognition. Man is a morbidly gregarious and partisan creature; he is deep in his immediate struggles and stands by his own kind because in so doing he defends himself; the industrialist is best equipped to criticize his fellow industrialist, but he finds the root of all evil in the banker; the wages worker shifts the blame for all social wrongs on the "employing class." There is an element of exasperation in most economic and social reactions, and there is hardly a reforming or revolutionary movement in history which is not essentially an indiscriminate attack of one functioning class or type upon another, on the assumption that the attacked class is entirely to blame for the clash and that the attacking class is self-sufficient in the commonweal and can dispense with its annoying collaborator. A considerable element of justice usually enters into such recriminations. But the Open Conspiracy cannot avail itself of these class animosities for its driving force. It can have, therefore, no uniform method of approach. For each class it has a conception of modification and development, and each class it approaches therefore at a distinctive angle. Some classes, no doubt, it would supersede altogether; others—the scientific investigator, for example—it must regard as almost wholly good and seek only to multiply and empower, but it can no more adopt the prejudices and extravagances of any particular class as its basis than it can adopt the claims of any existing state or empire.
>
> When it is clearly understood that the binding links of the Open Conspiracy we have in mind are certain broad general ideas, and that—except perhaps in the case of scientific workers—we have no current set of attitudes of mind and habits of activity which we can turn over directly and unmodified to the service of the conspiracy, we are in a position to realize that the movement we contemplate must from the outset be diversified in its traditions and elements and various in its methods. It must fight upon several fronts and with many sorts of equipment. It will have a common spirit, but it is quite conceivable that between many of its contributory factors there may be very wide gaps in understanding and sympathy. It is no sort of simple organization." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G. Wells](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1303661h.html)

> "We have now stated broadly but plainly the idea of the world commonweal which is the objective of the Open Conspiracy, and we have made a preliminary examination of the composition of that movement, showing that it must be necessarily not a class development, but a convergence of many different sorts of people upon a common idea. Its opening task must be the elaboration, exposition, and propaganda of this common idea, a steady campaign to revolutionize education and establish a modern ideology in men's minds and, arising out of this, the incomparably vaster task of the realization of its ideas." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

> "The Open Conspiracy is not necessarily antagonistic to any existing government. The Open Conspiracy is a creative, organizing movement and not an anarchistic one. It does not want to destroy existing controls and forms of human association, but either to supersede or amalgamate them into a common world directorate. If constitutions, parliaments, and kings can be dealt with as provisional institutions, trustees for the coming of age of the world commonweal, and in so far as they are conducted in that spirit, the Open Conspiracy makes no attack upon them." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.
