# Feeds, indexes & algorithms


We can build the classifiers in public - the ml models.
We can see which indexes other people prefer in terms of interfaces. The network state is 100% digital and is publicly expressed through client attribution - choice





computed & verifiable views?

promotion of videos will no longer be dominated just by the recommendation algorithm - when an influencer comments on a video his followers will see it and watch the said video too

We will be able to study the effects of recommendation algorithms for virality because all content has an interface where it came from

Interfaces will compete on the algorithms they let people use to filter and sort information - to look for signal through the noise.



# Transparency & choice of algorithms

Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data & being able to check the results for yourself

"Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with othersâ€”and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level."

with open data & transparent algorithms we could leverage AI to surface human collective intelligence at scale in a permissionless way - anyone could analyze the data and prove their results

one problem with twitter is the immediacy - the feed promotes recent engagement ONLY. and there's no good way to dig through history

We need control over feeds

Instead of a feed the home page could be a dashboard that shows areas of interest of your social graph and being able to selectively dive deeper in whatever you decide - feeds are primitive and extremely limiting
