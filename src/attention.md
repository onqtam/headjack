Is it a coincidence that one of the most important papers in AI/ML that introduced transformers was called `"Attention is all you need"`?

One of the most transformative (pun intended) papers in AI/ML is called ...

The importance of attention cannot be overstated

> "Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system." - [Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#:~:text=Attention%20is%20the%20flexible%20control%20of%20limited%20computational%20resources.%20Why%20those%20resources%20are%20limited%20and%20how%20they%20can%20best%20be%20controlled%20will%20vary%20across%20use%20cases%2C%20but%20the%20ability%20to%20dynamically%20alter%20and%20route%20the%20flow%20of%20information%20has%20clear%20benefits%20for%20the%20adaptiveness%20of%20any%20system.)

Facebook is a government with a monopoly not on violence but on attention and they are unaccountable to anyone for who or what they put in attention jail

Predatory tactics: inserting irrelevant entries along with search results with the aim of engagement


Attention has a cost - an opportunity cost. It is a resource and hence we "pay" attention
It also takes energy to process information and energy is just a resource as well


awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.
The phantom limb sensation is when the model is still operating according to the past - but the limb no longer exists. We still register the physical limb as present.

Humanity lacks a cohesive subjective awareness as a schematic model of itself - we lack an attention schema. We can't:
- control our attention
- model the attention of others and different groups of people

> "Awareness is the brain's way of describing to itself what it means to focus attention on something." - [Michael Graziano](https://youtu.be/H8twgvcA-Ko?t=349)
combining the capacity to build models and pay attention.



Reclaiming and directing attention




<!-- > "What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it." - [Herbert A. Simon](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/herbert_a_simon_181919) -->
