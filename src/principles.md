# Guiding principles

There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption & parity on convenience & UX with Web2 services:

- Aggregation and scale cannot be an afterthought - must be scalable to billions of users and that must be [obvious & provable](numbers.md) if entrepreneurs are expected to jump on the opportunity. The easiest mental model will win over developers - opinionated frameworks with a concrete direction are much simpler than a sea of standards, libraries & chains.

    - >"Developers care about risk." - [Haseeb](https://haseebq.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)

- Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices & explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers ([IDMs](IDM.md)) using email & pass / [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (`"login with Google"`) and would then be using these IDMs as [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) to authorize applications to post on their behalf. RSS was [too technical](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008) and it failed - [`"people jumped ship as soon as something better came along"`](https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss).

- Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data & blockchain interactions by default - costs & complexity should be shifted to services.
- Users should be able to own their identity & connections in a sovereign way with a keypair **even if by default** their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.
- Anyone should be able to have a pseudonymous identity, operate an [IDM](IDM.md), or serve media through an application. Anyone must be able to publish & broadcast through Headjack using their identity - [moderation & censorship](moderation.md) will happen at the application level.


<!-- TODO: key pillar: must not be worse than current web2 -->

<!-- "Sign-in with ethereum" will always be limited -->

<!-- TODO: key pillar: should make it hard for monopolies to form and data to be hoarded -->

Nobody wants to deal with keypairs.
Its ok to trust by default as long as there is a fallback option



<!-- TODO: Designed to stand the test of time - best crypto-economic guarantees, capital efficiency, and scalability. -->
