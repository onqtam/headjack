# Messages

<!-- TODO: take stuff form the other messages.md doc

signal/noise ratio - message types & why we shouldn't wait for AI classification

- fallback/default presentation/rendering - how to display content if an application doesn't support a new activity type

tag type: disprove/correct - to combat misinformation & help crowdsource truth?

Why Headjack won't fall victim to stagnation and being stuck in time with this open standard and sort-of federation
https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/
- because messages will have default renderability
- because you'll always be able to click on items that your application cannot display properly and go to the application that produced them and see them properly

message type/format: price predictions with percentage possibilities, so that later reputations can be plotted based on the message type

tag type idea: prediction, and later with oracles credibility & track records could be automated

- protobuf for message types?

subreddits would be implemented by a special message type with a tag for the subreddit that people are posting into

updates to old post...
    - how would old unique URLs to the original posts get updated?
multiple edit events in parallel to the same original message? a fork? :|


update to post - as a diff, with different kinds of diff algos?

dislike button/protocol/spec? ⇒ reactions

concern: message standards...

https://schema.org/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model

new types of messages get an on-chain ID so subscriptions are integer-based


messages contain their URIs and also a local timestamp - although that could be spoofed. It is however useful for ordering things in certain cases

also contain the current block height in addition to a unix timestamp

the <application_id>/<application_nonce> is embedded in a message that's being signed through an application/IDM such that it cannot suffer from a replay attack

- if a reply message has the URI to the original in non canonical form it would be harder for infrastructure to match those - it would have to translate the string URI to a number URI
