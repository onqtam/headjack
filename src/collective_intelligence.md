# collective intelligence & sensemaking
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

sunlight is the best disenfecatant
the fastest way for pro social behaviors is to make sure everyone's reputation is on the line

The role of something like change.org

your main job would be to be an annotator - such that you get scored based on performance

we need a shared view of reality and the ability to coordinate around that view of reality
we need social media that is rewarding synthesis of ideas
what if we rewarded those who find divisive fault lines and bridge the gap?


we need to enable freeform networking at scale in order to build a global brain - the host-centric model doesn't allow that - any type of data should be linkable & manipulatable with any other data type

high trust (social capital), shared stories & strong institutions - required for democracy, but social media is eroding them - Jonathan Haidt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu2jprZ50FY

"We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology." - Edward O. Wilson

media tells us what is salient but we lack the tools to question the framing

we should strive to separate causal patterns from correlated patterns

== A self-organizing system - in the sensemaking chapter
we can achieve cycles of differentiation (random exploration) followed by convergence & integration to refine our collective model of reality in a self-organizing system - just like our minds work
complexification followed by iterative integration - assimilation & compression - calibration against the real world is the constant flux between the two
zooming in and zooming out
https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=3112
stark contrast - Compare that to what we currently have - attention-driven feedback loops of psychosis & epileptic seizures - we are unable to integrate the signal - we have no capacity to adaptively re-fit itself to the world
The internet is suffering from epilepsy
our current systems optimize for efficiency (attention capture) - not the evolvability of ideas
the host-centric model hinders our ability to develop the tools for integration - for interlinking & coming to consensus - we're given one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator functionality in the race to the bottom of the brain stem

we lack precision weighting of the signals ==> hence our psychosis

> "the function of consciousness is to do enhanced relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4094)

> "what consciousness is doing is higher-order relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4199)

our capacity to pay attention in the right way was evolved - it is fundamentally an adaptive ability - it was selected for

building participatory governance at scale

This is the real DAO - the hivemind

distributed cognition or sensemaking?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition

let's boot up the collective intelligence

we need to build a strong central nervous system for this global organism

current platforms constrain our global neural network from freely wiring - we're allowed a very limited set of wiring

we should be able to come to consensus about questions such as "how much cobalt goes into EVs, how much EVs are not using cobalt at all anymore, and where is cobalt coming from (hint: not just the congo)"

there should be something like twitter's community notes for any kind of media - not just tweets

anyone should be able to construct graph narratives by selecting "facts" which can be observed & pointed at

just like we have a mental model when doing searches that we can request results only from the last month, the same way we'll learn to think in terms of filters & slices

we have a distorted view of reality because of the vocal and dominant minority - what if we allowed people to express themselves in aggregate without the consequences?

a dynamical system theory lays out the engine - the feedback loop between generation and governance/integration
> "there is a systematic relationship between a set of enabling & selective constraints" - [John Vervaeke](https://youtu.be/A_gH5VIZO0Q&t=1985&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&index=8)

sensemaking is when the pattern in the world matches the pattern in our head. Through crowdsourcing we feed distributed data, and through the system and the ability to look at data & its analysis from different angles we allow for its integration. We look for intersubjective agreement AKA consensus
^^ this needs more work

> "Technology for coordinating and coming to large-scale agreements (eg. [pol.is](https://pol.is/ ) is one of the industries that needs to be accelerated." - [Vitalik Buterin](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1599734481190998016)

The ability to take multiple perspectives and shift between them

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U2caURO-d4&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuj9U2DCHRN0gBfOwGy-Vcnq&index=61

The current web incentivizes differentiation and no integration - and thus we get group think and echo chambers & bubbles - we lack the complexification of multiple views of the real world - we need to make breaking our own frames & making new ones easier

> "We mistake having likes and friends with actually having participatory social connectedness" - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition / 24. 9. 2022](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=3373)

abstract meritocracy
the internet government
jamie joyce
what if technology could enable people to represent themselves and directly participate in federal legislative government themselves - politics without polititians

we can separate political ideas from people and representatives
what if we could inform our politics with such soft online governance in an abstract meritocracy

representative democracy is vulnerable

A bold idea to replace politicians | César Hidalgo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGWML6cI_k

representative polititians are packages and are full of compromises

what if we could submit all our views & morals and feed that through aggregation algorithms that then score different policies to determine which ones should be chosen? And what if all this data was anonymized and yet public so anyone can re-do the aggregates?
What if we could pull ZK credentials for different criteria from our real identity and input those (in some anonymized fashion) into the aggregation algorithm?

This algorithm can be public & open source



The third attractor is bottom-up emergent order

> "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." - [Melvin E. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

We’ve never had a true social network
A true social network allows data, events and identities to be linked in any way imaginable - today’s platforms are a lowest common denominator with hard constraints on how they can be extended

a bottom-up global governance system can only be built on top of a shared identity layer, trust, reputation & immutable history

boosting the competent through ranking their public information & track record objectively & transparently
we need to build the public introspection tool

# voting & liquid democracy
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

aggregation: the societal mirror - a chapter about signaling of public preferences & poll opinions
why are twitter polls only for 24 hours? and we can't see how specific people voted?
abstract polling: count & filter the results from any poll using any KYC filter or whatever ban list (so include/exclude for groups of people)
Reputation page and the message types that polls could be

the future of search is being able to re-run aggregation & statistics based on different filters

every claim and counter should be verifiable - even if at a processing cost
common knowledge should go there?

ranked choice voting
https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/

ability to specify criteria for the delegation - no need to pick specific people.

current twitter polls don't allow us to show our vote but we're free to express it in text publicly?

Study shows happiness doesnt increase above 200$k salary. Fuck that - do a poll

Trust is earned. In public.

Infinite digital twins - show different cross sections of polls based on dofferent filtering and oracle input data

Simulate reputation based on different sources of facts

tipranks-ify finance and predictions

we put way too much importance and give way too much attention to narrative builders and we underestimate the importance of transparency, track record & skin in the game


the skill tree in linkedin is completely fake - we could crowdsource it or have reputation systems based on real events & attestations and allow for any visualization

we can have a leaderboard for every topic under the sun

Replace signaling with competence

Skin in the game

"social reputation without settlement" - no oracle needed
Chapter on oracles and how theyre not necessary - just do a recount & recalculate reputation based on different facts

we should hold people who claim to be public intellectuals to a higher standard - not acknowledging that a comment might have been deleted by mistake and LATER commenting that it wasn't deleted and still there (although it's not there anymore)
