sunlight is the best disenfecatant
the fastest way for pro social behaviors is to make sure everyone's reputation is on the line

The role of something like change.org

your main job would be to be an annotator - such that you get scored based on performance

we need to enable freeform networking at scale in order to build a global brain - the host-centric model doesn't allow that - any type of data should be linkable & manipulatable with any other data type

high trust (social capital), shared stories & strong institutions - required for democracy, but social media is eroding them - Jonathan Haidt

"We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology." - Edward O. Wilson

media tells us what is salient but we lack the tools to question the framing

we should strive to separate causal patterns from correlated patterns

== A self-organizing system - in the sensemaking chapter
we can achieve cycles of differentiation (random exploration) followed by convergence & integration to refine our collective model of reality in a self-organizing system - just like our minds work
complexification followed by iterative integration - assimilation & compression - calibration against the real world is the constant flux between the two
zooming in and zooming out

stark contrast - Compare that to what we currently have - attention-driven feedback loops of psychosis & epileptic seizures - we are unable to integrate the signal - we have no capacity to adaptively re-fit itself to the world
The internet is suffering from epilepsy
our current systems optimize for efficiency (attention capture) - not the evolvability of ideas
the host-centric model hinders our ability to develop the tools for integration - for interlinking & coming to consensus - we're given one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator functionality in the race to the bottom of the brain stem

we lack precision weighting of the signals ==> hence our psychosis

> "the function of consciousness is to do enhanced relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4094)

> "what consciousness is doing is higher-order relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4199)

our capacity to pay attention in the right way was evolved - it is fundamentally an adaptive ability - it was selected for

building participatory governance at scale

This is the real DAO - the hivemind

distributed cognition or sensemaking?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition

let's boot up the collective intelligence

we need to build a strong central nervous system for this global organism

current platforms constrain our global neural network from freely wiring - we're allowed a very limited set of wiring

we should be able to come to consensus about questions such as "how much cobalt goes into EVs, how much EVs are not using cobalt at all anymore, and where is cobalt coming from (hint: not just the congo)"

there should be something like twitter's community notes for any kind of media - not just tweets

# voting & liquid democracy
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

ability to specify criteria for the delegation - no need to pick specific people.

current twitter polls don't allow us to show our vote but we're free to express it in text publicly?

Study shows happiness doesnt increase above 200$k salary. Fuck that - do a poll

# privacy

Private opinions for polls - you might not want them public but still to be able to compare with those who are public

Zk affiliation/attestations/credentials

# reputation systems
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

incentives & reputation
> "While no one can achieve perfect objectivity and fair-mindedness, those who strive for it get far closer than those who do not. This is true at both the scale of an individual and the scale of a society." - [Where Arguments Come From](https://consilienceproject.org/where-arguments-come-from/#:~:text=While%20no%20one%20can%20achieve%20perfect%20objectivity%20and%20fair%2Dmindedness%2C%20those%20who%20strive%20for%20it%20get%20far%20closer%20than%20those%20who%20do%20not.%20This%20is%20true%20at%20both%20the%20scale%20of%20an%20individual%20and%20the%20scale%20of%20a%20society.)


Trust is earned. In public.

Infinite digital twins - show different cross sections of polls based on dofferent filtering and oracle input data

Simulate reputation based on different sources of facts

tipranks-ify finance and predictions

we put way too much importance and give way too much attention to narrative builders and we underestimate the importance of transparency, track record & skin in the game


the skill tree in linkedin is completely fake - we could crowdsource it or have reputation systems based on real events & attestations and allow for any visualization

we can have a leaderboard for every topic under the sun

Replace signaling with competence

Skin in the game

"social reputation without settlement" - no oracle needed
Chapter on oracles and how theyre not necessary - just do a recount & recalculate reputation based on different facts

we should hold people who claim to be public intellectuals to a higher standard - not acknowledging that a comment might have been deleted by mistake and LATER commenting that it wasn't deleted and still there (although it's not there anymore)
