by default, if you don't have a handle, your comments aren't seen by everyone but only by the ones who own the content. They get to see everything and only if they quote-retweet you do others se your activity. and if they follow you they will see your posts always

this is making not only backends but also moderation lists & users liquid

The most common suggestion we received in regards to our CSAM problem was to connect our website to Facebook and send them every single file that our users upload, so that Facebook can scan the file and tell us whether the file should be allowed on our website. A similar service is offered by Microsoft, and I believe Apple and Google each have something as well.


hope for spam & moderation: if there is a market for it it could be solved faster as compared when a monopoly has to deal with that - like with spam and email - anyone can build tools to fight spam in email


this project doesn't have all the answers for moderation & spam protection but it is the base layer that can support anything on top.

Curation/upvote mechanic - every upvote costs a little of the token that goes to the creator, but the first to upvote get a % of the profits - incentivizing upvoting quality content

Of course freedom of reach is freedom of speech. Speech without reach isn’t free speech; it’s just mumbling to yourself.

"Do you think freedom of speech includes the right to say and believe obnoxious stupid shit that’s almost certainly false, or do you feel platforms have the responsibility to arbitrate truth and regulate online behavior for the sake of some supposed greater good?"
That’s the real question here, and everything else is either willfully (or accidentally) naive online posturing.
