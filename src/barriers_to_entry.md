# Vertical integration vs markets/competition

Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages & trade secrets.

This leads to:
- lack of cooperation, interoperability, duplicated effort & stifled innovation
- competition for scarce talent which leads to sub-par solutions
- company bloat & inefficiencies
    - companies are harder to manage as they are way bigger than what they could be
    - bigger size demands higher revenue - pricing out many business models
- differences in functionality between platforms => complexity for users

Contrast that to open protocols & exportable data where anyone can specialize, innovate & provide the best possible service for a specific vertical & sell it to others. The move from [host to data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing and open blockchains enable [interoperability](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/) and composability.

# Growth, network effects & monopolies

Social media platforms are growth-at-all-costs stories because the goal is to achieve a network effect first and become a monopoly with a [MOAT](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp) at which point the user [value extraction](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1473859531343949824) and cannibalization of ecosystems built on top of APIs can ramp up ([1](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/twitter-apis-ending), [2](https://nordicapis.com/twitter-10-year-struggle-with-developer-relations/), [3](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/meerkat-founder-on-getting-the-kill-call-from-twitter/), [4](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/), [5](https://mashable.com/article/gmail-ifttt-shutdown-google), [6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/04/11/how-to-kill-your-ecosystem-twitter-pulls-an-evil-move-with-its-firehose/?sh=4cd97d0f61d3)). At that point innovation is less necessary (+ is harder due to inertia) and even the quality of service may degrade. User data is the most valuable commodity and scale enables the best AI models & efficiency of value extraction in the advertising model which comes with a slew of problems & perverse incentives.

Users are usually locked-in and effectively have no [voice and exit](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1548725591687303168) either because:
- the network effects are insurmountable for incumbents and there are no alternatives
- or if they leave for an alternative service they'd lose all their connections, audience & reputation and would have to start from scratch

> "I think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

> "Twitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

# The cold start problem for startups

The barrier to entry for most types of platforms is very high:
- kickstarting a network effect & attracting a critical mass is very difficult
- need to reinvent the wheel & [vertically integrate](barriers_to_entry.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) many aspects instead of composing a service from already existing solutions

And thus few companies are started and even fewer are successful - leading to little innovation, slow progress & sub-par services.
