# Today's information ecology

<!-- addictive social media - toxic -->
<!-- 
The topic about algorithms and their influence on society is enormous and this chapter cannot do it justice - refer to Tristan Harris's work

we have a totally warped view of reality

we are at a position where the more we use social media, the worse we get at estimating what the other side believes

Algorithms are tuned for nutpicking - surfacing the nuttiest things

Arms race between social media companies

broken media

long form media is rife with misinformation - in an open system we could better tag and discuss it

we should be able to see all referenced facts & entities in long-form media - much easier to check for disinfo

But YouTube doesn't optimize for that - not at all.
