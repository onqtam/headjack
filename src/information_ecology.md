# The host-centric web & its decay

One major problem of the current [host-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md#todays-web-host-centric) internet architecture is that documents are host-certified - we refer to data by location instead of contents, but that leads to link rot & content drift. Information is fragile without an ecosystem of identity, reputation, references, context & liability - our digital history lacks a solid foundation. We can't expect everyone to be like [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) - linking to articles from the Internet Archive ([Example](https://balajis.com/synthesis/): look what `"Prussian"` in that text is [pointing to](https://archive.ph/O2D45)) - this doesn't scale, data is still not self-authenticating and is reliant on a central point of failure. The internet is a [collective hallucination](https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/2019-06_zittrainIP.pdf) and is rotting. It's as permanent as a [sand mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala) and its just a matter of time for it to go away. Some great quotes:

> "The problem is that the foundations are shifting sands, and we need something that has significantly more integrity at the bottom layer, we can't just bolt [URNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name) on as an afterthought. Some organizations are able to maintain persistent data over time, but it is in spite of the technology, not because of it." - [tgbugs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27691442)

# Cultural fragmentation & filter bubbles

The same document may be published through different platforms and because of the host-certified web of today it will get multiple different URLs. Discussion around it becomes fragmented & shallow in the different platforms with separate comment sections and there isn't a way to de-duplicate & unify it. This facilitates polarization as separate echo chambers can form without seeing the opinion of other types of people.

<!-- Alienating large parts of the population & pushing them to alternative closed platforms is not a net benefit. -->

> "Echo chambers are intellectual oppression - as opposed to idea labs where ideas are treated as experiments." - [Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDwzBYsED4)

Instead imagine being able to view the entire discussion around a specific event by tracing & aggregating all of the re-publications, references & re-tweets & quotes of it from anywhere and applying any type of filter to that.

That is what interoperable identity, content-addressing & broadcasted data enables - we can connect and de-duplicate everything and allow anyone to build tools around that - constructing a much bigger graph that what Google have created for themselves.

# Moderation & censorship

This is an incredibly hairy topic with many aspects - here are just a few of them:

- No clear rules for moderation & censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
    - account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like [shadow banning](https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/)
    - accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)
- There is no way for users to "fork" a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.
- There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter & YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal [vertically integrated](barriers_to_entry.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner. In an open system such as e-mail the competition & innovation for solving spam has been tremendous.

we are at a position where the more we use social media, the worse we get at estimating what the other side believes

Journalists routinely write about events from social media - it is fundamentally entrenched in our society and it affects everyone - even those that do not use it.

broken media
culture war, algorithms, audience capture, misaligned incentives, lack of accountability

The culture war and division are fueled by corporate and media interests

long form media is rife with misinformation - in an open system we could better tag and discuss it

we should be able to see all referenced facts & entities in long-form media - much easier to check for disinfo

the inability to refer specifically to documents or parts of them linked to their source has made the internet a breeding ground for misinformation

audience capture

It’s an unorganized mess of information

Misinformation is a plague in videos without context

the health of reporting on the web through video is appaling - decentralization and democratization are powerful but without the means to interleave everything into a shared ledger of record and actually have some accountability it all becomes an informational mess. But YouTube doesn't optimize for that - not at all.
