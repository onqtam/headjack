# Content addressing

The move from host-centric to data-centric addressing is a complete paradigm shift by itself but Headjack intertwines that with names and on-chain authorization & sequencing of anchors resulting in the best possible [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) in terms of human-readability & persistence - perhaps the most important aspect of the project. This chapter is broken down into a few sub-chapters:

1. [Today's web: host-centric](host_centric.md)
2. [Data-centric addressing](data_centric.md)
3. [Blob structure & addressing](blob_structure.md)
4. [Persistent & provable URIs](uris.md)
5. [Names & paths](names_and_paths.md)
