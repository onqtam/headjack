# The ambition

Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs & micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and [making it sovereign](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441) - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces & views that present & filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.

TODO: take this metaverse thing out of here and into the other page

It is an informational gravity well with a strong network effect that would suck all data to be cryptographically anchored to it

Headjack has an ecosystem effect - a product network effect, and identity is at the core of it. Case Study: Dropbox vs. Google Drive

Think of Headjack as an [information bus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf) on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self-describing messages, dynamically definable message types & permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity & authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage & retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain ([IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)) for which durability & retrievability is on a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) basis without guarantees. It can [scale](numbers.md) practically as much as necessary. Another way to look at it is as a global [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) messaging network similar to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway. It is the manifestation of Jack's [vision for decentralizing Twitter](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106).

[IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System), [Filecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filecoin), [Sia](https://sia.tech/) & [Arweave](https://arwiki.wiki/) are the drivers, Headjack is the filesystem, and the collection of media & services built on top will be the global OS. Moving to a data-centric model where everything is addressable under a common global namespace would force applications to be [interoperable](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/).

Headjack [definitively](https://boxkitemachine.net/posts/zero-to-one-peter-thiel-definite-vs-indefinite-thinking/) aims to be the backbone of the entire public web - the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088) where all content is cryptographically anchored and totally ordered. The confluence of human-readable & persistent addressing, indexing, identity, names, and the interest graph results in a winner-take-all network effect with unprecedented gravity that can organize the world's data - [`@naval: "The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything"`](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3527). It can succeed in completely decentralizing [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) and disaggregating traditional platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, YouTube & Instagram through unbundling, reconstruction & interoperability on top of Headjack's building blocks by mixing and matching various presentation layers, architectures, business models, content moderation policies, etc. [`"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."`](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20103-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts)

Headjack is the [15th and final](https://xkcd.com/927/) standard for decentralized identity and media - just because it's a lot of work doesn't mean we shouldn't be building on the right foundation. It is the supermassive digital gravity well and is going after the entire web as the coordination substrate of [cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).

The outcome is binary - **`success`** or **`failure`**.
