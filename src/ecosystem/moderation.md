The most common suggestion we received in regards to our CSAM problem was to connect our website to Facebook and send them every single file that our users upload, so that Facebook can scan the file and tell us whether the file should be allowed on our website. A similar service is offered by Microsoft, and I believe Apple and Google each have something as well.


hope for spam & moderation: if there is a market for it it could be solved faster as compared when a monopoly has to deal with that - like with spam and email - anyone can build tools to fight spam in email


this project doesn't have all the answers for moderation & spam protection but it is the base layer that can support anything on top.
