The public commons are gatekept and harvested by a select few platforms - we need to democratize access to what is public already


fragmentation

The great attention misallocation

today's media is an attention hijacker - one that shows us what is salient to us, but not necessarily what's true

> "The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses." - [Malcolm X](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/74430-the-media-s-the-most-powerful-entity-on-earth-they-have)

Current social media is garbage- garbage in, garbage out

We as a society dont know ourselves en masse - only a few companies are in that position

Context switching is terrible for the brain - Twitter is an ADHD/ADD machine

# incentives & the status quo
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

We're the cattle and the platforms are our ranchers
The media incentive alignment problem: what we're allowed to do with public data with no programmatic access to it
"realigning incentives"
By severing the connection between identity management and media we can better align the incentives of these systems - our IDMs would not be harvesting our attention and we could tune the addictiveness & notifications

the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled & recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization
time well spent: user empowerment in being able to control what they want to see & how much of it

> "He who controls identity controls the (social) world." - [Jordan Hall](https://deepcode.substack.com/p/sovereignty-as-a-service#:~:text=He%20who%20controls%20identity%20controls%20the%20(social)%20world.)

the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized & undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.

██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████


we should shift curation from explicit moderation by people to tagging & filtration preferences by the consumer

choice vs algorithmic recommendation

recommender algorithms incentivise clickbait. Explicit follow graphs incentivise quality & explicit recommendations by people you follow

recommender systems & search engines should NOT give you "other things you might be interested in" interleaved with the results for a specific query just to get you more engaged - but that's something YouTube is doing. You didn't ask for that but you got it

misaligned incentives

on attention:
https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-intellectual-obesity-crisis

the 2 sides of "the consumer is always right":
- the brain stem one - whatever they engage the most with is the right thing
- the frontral cortex one - whatever they explicitly choose is the right thing

we should all be labellers - in an open way such that anyone can harness our collective intelligence

What if the way an event or a piece of news to get to more eyes was not through recommendation algorithms but through explicit annotation of what's inside - such that people can have explicit interest in those? What if people would rank stories by importance and then subscribe to filters based on people they trust would rank stories properly? What if you could allocate an attention budget of say 30 minutes per day or 20 news items and get the top after sorting, with the option to get the next batch if you want more?

# organizing information - interlinking & deduplicating data

- knowledge graphs & the semantic web

google have failed with their mission - they have not organized the world's information - they have merely ranked it - organization is much broader
Google failed - they didnt organize the worlds information - they merely ranked it

just like in open source problems need to be solved only once, the same way in a world of unified identity & deduplicated concepts interwoven with social media debates need to be had only once

stable identity keys allows for stable concept/collection/noun keys which allows for stable mapping and deduplication of concepts

We need to deduplicate & reduce the amount of unique joinable keys for nouns, concepts, events & products. In the case when the same noun is published multiple times by different entities - maps of equivalence could be published so that nouns are equated to mean the same thing. We should be able to toggle which equivalence maps to enable.

joinability

key stability ==> information deduplication & integration

If you choose an obscure tag or even if its the same but from an unpopular collection you'd simply limit your visibility & discoverability - there's an implied incentive to use the most popular collections when tagging your content

We should be able to view the most pressing questions for public figures and CEOs
Integrating all these different use cases with social media and unified identity and notifications is how to make them viral
We should be able to surface questions to elites and leaders and make it glaringly obvious if they have responded to them or not
It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same identity & data network
Sporadic Reddit AMAs are absolutely ibadequate
every account should have an AMA associated with them
This is what connecting people looks like - facebook isnt even scratching t he surface

Disallowing comments on a youtube video is just dumb because you cannot disallow comments for it on reddit anyway - all you are doing is trying to hide commentary about what you are presenting

concern: negative reputation & "scarlet letters"

fine-grained control
When viewing a post - have the ability to choose wether to respect the OP’s blocks and not see comments from blocked users ot not 

https://twitter.com/SocietyLibrary
the internet is unstructured
linked knowledge database
libraries & debate maps
libraries - concepts can be linked to different multimedia expressions - resources that describe it
debate maps are the onthological structure of the debate - aimed at deliberation

what if wikipedia-like "pages" were sitting on top of debate maps, highlighting an editorialized take and perhaps generated/summarized by an LLM? And what if people could choose the editorialization?

knowledge graph

this needs to be intertwined with social media, identity & follow graphs

giant global graph
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph
a massively multiplayer interlinked knowledge database

machine-understandable knowledge representations
subject-predicate-object triplets in the semantic web
these are just like subject-verb-object of the human natural language - there's an equivalence

being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign

sensemaking is about creating maps

redundant knowledge & broken chains of provenance

interlinking enables discoverability - you'd want to reference something specific because then you could be discovered from the referenced thing with a "references" view

we should be able to annotate parts of movies that we are crituiquing and be able to see all public critiques when viewing the original media

provenance graphs - imagine being able to check if any of the inputs of a story has been influenced by a specific source

apps should be able to show you all references to a document - perhaps they might show specific UIs for those that are supported and all others should be in the "other" list without visualization

on-chain nouns with IDs so that no one person controls the set and DA is guaranteed? what if a quorum of validators/tokenholders is required for the approval of a noun set? what if only the keys of the nouns are on-chain, but for big values only the hash can be stored on-chain? but the key is still stable for joins?

# Structured data & improving the signal/noise ratio
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

nature has removed every unnecessary bit when it comes to exchange of information - and so should we.

information theory very well could be as important as or even fundamental to matter & the laws of physics and they are tightly interwoven - we should keep that as a perspective - as to why we should strive to optimize it

signal/noise ratio - language is unbelievably complex and it compacts so much implied and assumed meaning and expressions of truth

Let's take 2 sides of a debate around vaccines - Brett Weinstein & Scott Adams. It is impossible for someone to quickly see where they've been on the debate throughout time without pouring hundreds of hours sifting through old tweets & watching endless podcasts & episodes. Their opinions should have been codified with structured data & logged in a time-series.

the hammer is language and unfortunately every problem is a nail

hashtags should be separated from the text

Moving the vast majority of online activity to structured data and reducing the text reduces the load for content moderation
Also there's less room for emotive/russel conjugation & other such emotionally manipulative language & pre/re-framing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation

Mission: raise the signal/noise ratio

We need more than the current one size fits all model
Importance/severity threshold/levels?

we should be able to use AI to determine the level of plagiarism between online posts and reduce the noise

digital media is not supposed to be unstructured

Structured data should be incentivized - we’re drowning in text audio and video

we can use AI to generate podcast-like conversations that cover the digital interactions of structured data

currently we channel our energy in a useless way - the best we can do is get a hashtag trending. But with this system every type of interaction would count

using structured data circumvents the need to think about the right words - it reduces friction in expression - streamlined expression as a chapter?

Steve bannon is famous for saying to flood the zone with shit - lets drain the swamp

"Speech as proof of work is dead."
https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1622999277411741698

what if we enable communication through structured data and formal methods on top of it? What if we enable anyone to build any kind of sophisticated tool for formal modeling of the world around us?

so much expressed opinions & views are left unanalyzed & unaggregated because they're in text - they have an ephemeral impact for a moment and then fade
