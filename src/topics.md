The public commons are gatekept and harvested by a select few platforms - we need to democratize access to what is public already


fragmentation

The great attention misallocation

today's media is an attention hijacker - one that shows us what is salient to us, but not necessarily what's true

> "The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses." - [Malcolm X](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/74430-the-media-s-the-most-powerful-entity-on-earth-they-have)

Current social media is garbage- garbage in, garbage out

We as a society dont know ourselves en masse - only a few companies are in that position

Context switching is terrible for the brain - Twitter is an ADHD/ADD machine

We're the cattle and the platforms are our ranchers
The media incentive alignment problem: what we're allowed to do with public data with no programmatic access to it
"realigning incentives"
By severing the connection between identity management and media we can better align the incentives of these systems - our IDMs would not be harvesting our attention and we could tune the addictiveness & notifications

the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled & recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization
time well spent: user empowerment in being able to control what they want to see & how much of it

> "He who controls identity controls the (social) world." - [Jordan Hall](https://deepcode.substack.com/p/sovereignty-as-a-service#:~:text=He%20who%20controls%20identity%20controls%20the%20(social)%20world.)

YouTube recently removed the option to sort the videos of a channel by oldest first - because why not - because they can.

the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized & undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.

VERTICAL INTEGRATION:
    Youtube now has posts like twitter where you talk to your subscribers - why a separate network ?! why are all these platforms reinventing the same features ?!

    Why does spotify need to build video streaming to compete with youtube?

we should shift curation from explicit moderation by people to tagging & filtration preferences by the consumer

TODO: integrate these 2 (about the move from social/interest graph to recommendation algorithms):

choice vs algorithmic recommendation

recommender algorithms incentivise clickbait. Explicit follow graphs incentivise quality & explicit recommendations by people you follow

recommender systems & search engines should NOT give you "other things you might be interested in" interleaved with the results for a specific query just to get you more engaged - but that's something YouTube is doing. You didn't ask for that but you got it

misaligned incentives

on attention:
https://gurwinder.substack.com/p/the-intellectual-obesity-crisis

the 2 sides of "the consumer is always right":
- the brain stem one - whatever they engage the most with is the right thing
- the frontral cortex one - whatever they explicitly choose is the right thing

we should all be labellers - in an open way such that anyone can harness our collective intelligence

What if the way an event or a piece of news to get to more eyes was not through recommendation algorithms but through explicit annotation of what's inside - such that people can have explicit interest in those? What if people would rank stories by importance and then subscribe to filters based on people they trust would rank stories properly? What if you could allocate an attention budget of say 30 minutes per day or 20 news items and get the top after sorting, with the option to get the next batch if you want more?

Follow preferences of others - not just as notifications for changes but also the ability to automatically adopt them

Sociology and how anyone can do it - picture: mirror

- knowledge graphs & the semantic web

google have failed with their mission - they have not organized the world's information - they have merely ranked it - organization is much broader
Google failed - they didnt organize the worlds information - they merely ranked it

just like in open source problems need to be solved only once, the same way in a world of unified identity & deduplicated concepts interwoven with social media debates need to be had only once

stable identity keys allows for stable concept/collection/noun keys which allows for stable mapping and deduplication of concepts

We need to deduplicate & reduce the amount of unique joinable keys for nouns, concepts, events & products. In the case when the same noun is published multiple times by different entities - maps of equivalence could be published so that nouns are equated to mean the same thing. We should be able to toggle which equivalence maps to enable.

joinability

stability of identifiers is crucial for relational databases.
The relational model is built on the premise of stable identifiers.

key stability ==> information deduplication & integration

If you choose an obscure tag or even if its the same but from an unpopular collection you'd simply limit your visibility & discoverability - there's an implied incentive to use the most popular collections when tagging your content

We should be able to view the most pressing questions for public figures and CEOs
Integrating all these different use cases with social media and unified identity and notifications is how to make them viral
We should be able to surface questions to elites and leaders and make it glaringly obvious if they have responded to them or not
It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same identity & data network
Sporadic Reddit AMAs are absolutely ibadequate
every account should have an AMA associated with them
This is what connecting people looks like - facebook isnt even scratching t he surface

Disallowing comments on a youtube video is just dumb because you cannot disallow comments for it on reddit anyway - all you are doing is trying to hide commentary about what you are presenting

concern: negative reputation & "scarlet letters"

https://twitter.com/SocietyLibrary
the internet is unstructured
linked knowledge database
libraries & debate maps
libraries - concepts can be linked to different multimedia expressions - resources that describe it
debate maps are the onthological structure of the debate - aimed at deliberation

what if wikipedia-like "pages" were sitting on top of debate maps, highlighting an editorialized take and perhaps generated/summarized by an LLM? And what if people could choose the editorialization?

knowledge graph

this needs to be intertwined with social media, identity & follow graphs

giant global graph
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph
a massively multiplayer interlinked knowledge database

machine-understandable knowledge representations
subject-predicate-object triplets in the semantic web
these are just like subject-verb-object of the human natural language - there's an equivalence

being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign

sensemaking is about creating maps

redundant knowledge & broken chains of provenance

interlinking enables discoverability - you'd want to reference something specific because then you could be discovered from the referenced thing with a "references" view

we should be able to annotate parts of movies that we are crituiquing and be able to see all public critiques when viewing the original media

configuration attributes to accounts

history of seen tweets - like history of watched videos on youtube

we have many facets to our personalities - we could share a lot more
we are social creatures

complete control of what is public and what is not - what digital trail you leave, and the ability to subscribe to anything for events

not multidimensional subscriptions but fractal/granular

how to think about the digital world
- public/private

what can we build on top of this?

add tiny designs/screenshots for the different ideas - like a multi-level tree for subscriptions and how you could be partially subscribed to someone

multidimensionality - think about what "friendship" is

multi dimensionalism of accounts section
What if we could signal our values and then be held accountable according to them? Like "being considerate instead of tribal" or "considering both sides of an argument"

list explicitly all the different aspects of an online presence - goodreads, medium, quora, stack exchange, reddit, twitter, etc.

your profile page - a linktree-like thing
every change, every edit, every commit - all could be linked to your identity if you wished it

view profile relevant to the current app VS view full profile with all activity

copy & follow the viewing preferences of others

When you show your Attention (what algorithms, apps & settings you're using, & even your history) you get attention for it - in regards to the signaling

Currently only the platforms get to analyze your behavior - you should be able to choose to let anyone analyze it for the commons

imagine being able to not see the same things multiple times when you open your feed multiple times and scroll a bit - having a "seen" list with URIs which you can later browse like the history in youtube - something like this should exist

fighting spam - in this system every event has provable provenance of who sent it and who their IDM is - we can track & label/exclude/punish IDMs that are the originators of spam - this is much better than the crude ways email fought spam - by blacklisting IP ranges and all that

Let's take 2 sides of a debate around vaccines - Brett Weinstein & Scott Adams. It is impossible for someone to quickly see where they've been on the debate throughout time without pouring hundreds of hours sifting through old tweets & watching endless podcasts & episodes. Their opinions should have been codified with structured data & logged in a time-series.

the hammer is language and unfortunately every problem is a nail

hashtags should be separated from the text

Moving the vast majority of online activity to structured data and reducing the text reduces the load for content moderation
Also there's less room for emotive/russel conjugation & other such emotionally manipulative language & pre/re-framing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation

Mission: raise the signal/noise ratio

We need more than the current one size fits all model
Importance/severity threshold/levels?

we should be able to use AI to determine the level of plagiarism between online posts and reduce the noise

digital media is not supposed to be unstructured

Structured data should be incentivized - we’re drowning in text audio and video

we can use AI to generate podcast-like conversations that cover the digital interactions of structured data

currently we channel our energy in a useless way - the best we can do is get a hashtag trending. But with this system every type of interaction would count

using structured data circumvents the need to think about the right words - it reduces friction in expression - streamlined expression as a chapter?

what if we enable communication through structured data and formal methods on top of it? What if we enable anyone to build any kind of sophisticated tool for formal modeling of the world around us?

so much expressed opinions & views are left unanalyzed & unaggregated because they're in text - they have an ephemeral impact for a moment and then fade

by increasing the amount of structured data we'd lower the amount of text that has to be checked for the rules - such as incitement of violence. Many freeform posts can be replaced by structured data
