# The metaverse


<!-- 
Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.

the visual metaverse could be built on top of headjack and nvidia's omniverse
omniverse usd (universal scene description)


the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing applications & views that present & filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.


the early web was built on open protocols - and so will the metaverse


> "The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

- This is what the metaverse will be built on
- The metaverse is about provable activity linked to identity beyond the confines of any specific platform
- The metaverse is fully addressable and people create more than they transact
- The metaverse is being able to refer to anything and anyone.
- The metaverse is about agency in creation
- TODO: read this from "The Coming Evolution of Games" onward:

We need to persistently link activity with identity to build reputation systems


> "We think of the metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace."

you need to be able to pull and reference anything from any part of the metaverse

instance/nonce/collections from an identity - perhaps 100% off-chain issuance with on-chain integer-only updates to facilitate off-chain "namespaces" & libraries of objects

How would marketplaces for off-chain items from a collection work?


Look at improbable for metaverse and M2 - Herman Narula

the metaverse will be built as a layered stack

the metaverse is experiences with shared data linked to identity


The metaverse is digital creation tied to identity - not 3d
