# The metaverse

What is the Metaverse? Here are some of the best quotes about its nature:

> "The metaverse isn’t a 3D world owned by some corporation. It’s a permissionless market-network which respects and interconnects all user-owned and cryptographically-secured digital identities, reputations, wallets, communities, spaces, and objects.<!-- It’s bootstrapping right now. -->" - [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1434586449068756993)

> "We think of the metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace." - [source](https://blog.ceramic.network/into-the-dataverse/)

> "The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

<!-- > "Metaverse doesn’t mean 3D, it means decentralized." - [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1516477829134704641) -->

The metaverse is about entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing applications & views that present & filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable. **But how does Headjack fit in it?**

We believe the way forward is through a layered stack of technologies & open protocols and that underneath everything sit identity & content addressing as primitives. All experiences & events can & will be interlinked, tied to identity & made easily referencable. Anything can be built & made composable & interoperable on top of these building blocks as long as they don't impose any constraints - no more walled gardens and fractured experiences. Furthermore, the Metaverse is mostly about agency in creation - transaction, exchange & finance are not at the forefront and will be handled by other layers & protocols like public generalized smart contract chains & NFTs.

> "The metaverse has nothing to do with “view” modalities — the tools you use to see the metaverse. That’s a convenient meme for those who have control over manufacturing hardware." - [source](https://future.com/7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse/)


This section couldn't possibly do justice to all the aspects of what it would take to build the Metaverse - please refer to these 2 resources about it from a16z - perhaps the best ones around:

instance/nonce/collections from an identity - perhaps 100% off-chain issuance with on-chain integer-only updates to facilitate off-chain "namespaces" & libraries of objects

How would marketplaces for off-chain items from a collection work?

> "When thinking about the metaverse, however, the engine takes on a more important role. To break down the walls that separate one game or experience from another, it is likely that games will be wrapped and hosted within the engine, instead of the other way around. In this expanded view, engines become platforms, and communication between these engines will largely define what I think of as the shared metaverse." - [source](https://future.com/metaverse-infrastructure-technology-games/)

> "Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)
