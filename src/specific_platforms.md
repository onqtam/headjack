# Specific platforms

A non-exhaustive list of additional problems (beyond what's already listed) with some platforms:

- YouTube:
    - there is no longer a down vote count & like/dislike ratio
    - subscriptions are by now almost meaningless without the notification bell icon
    - the comment section is just an afterthought - they don't care about it
        - the presentation is extremely basic & limiting
        - you cannot even link to a specific comment with a URL
        - financial scams in comments are abundant - moderation is non-existent
- Twitter:
    - we can't even sort the tweets of someone based on engagement
    - we pin threads of threads on our profiles and sequence them with X/YY numbers
    - cannot sort quotes/replies of a tweet based on engagement/age
    - no unrolled thread view option even though it's a no-brainer at this point
    - filtering & tuning what is shown in lists is nonexistent
        - lists don't show replies that are not to accounts in that list
        - can't display likes in lists
    - we [can't see other people's feeds](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1502846781150822402) (although there's this [third-party app](https://vicariously.io/))
    - no way to opt-out of recommendations in the main feed for topics you don't care about or unrelated activity such as `X received a reply from someone you don't follow`
    - find the beginning of [this thread](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1531668215541145601) - is that readable & usable? There should be an alternative Reddit-style application


Twitter should have added this feature years ago: "follow" a thread (w/o having to comment as a hack way to do this).


<!-- tweets & comments without tagging is primitive and inefficient -->

when twitter decide engagement is low they shove down your throat nonsense algorithmic "recent tweets" notifications you can't turn off - that's what it has devolved into. "See less often" from the dropdown menu does nothing. Misaligned incentives.
