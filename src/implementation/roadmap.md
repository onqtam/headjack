# Go to market & growth strategy

- first 1k/10k indexes reserved & given with auctions/randomly to influential ppl
    - elon could get index 42 - the answer to the universe


- the OAuth-like experience - a major selling point, web2 feel

- an open source "twitter core" so that others can spin up competing interfaces easily

- incentive to be earlier in the system - lower index proves that

- bootstrapping with ppl will be the hardest problem actually.
    - developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset & how to attract influencers.

TODO: think about
- tech talent
- growth strategy
- do a table with different groups & types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted

having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass
TODO: this goes in the growth strat!





Whitepaper (+ brainstorming with some giga brains)
Funding, operations (legal, accounting, tokenomics), hiring
In parallel:
    Blockchain
    Block Graph explorer
    OAuth-like service (SSO)
    Defining a set of messages (post, reply, repost, like, etc).
        Based on existing standards & data models - ActivityPub
    Open source Twitter core (a centralized Twitter implementation)
    A for-profit Twitter clone utilizing the core
    Other types of for-profit interfaces - unpinch?
    Talking to other platforms & partnerships - Odysee, etc.
