# reconstructing analogs to current internet tech

Blueprints page instead of architectures

TODO: rename to "possible use cases & architectures"


# Aggregator service - pay and go on chain


PoV of interface:
- I want to route & display content as fast and correctly as possible depending on the interest graph, my current users & their interests

TODO: think about creator monetization and how google currently gets the lions share of the ad revenue
What if some platforms don't freely provide the content but just anchor it and provide APIs like embedding youtube?


substack

Clubhouse

Downsides: echochamber specific frontends that exacerbate them on purpose


this can fold substack, instagram, twitter, reddit, youtube - all into one.

Picture the global git & reddified wikipedia - twitter is just scratching the surface. Full accountability
Wikipedia analog as an example

Wikipedia needs to be rebuilt on this - imagine a q&a section like twitter for every paraphrase and also a git slider to see the history for each paragraph. This index can also be moved interplanetary


Todo: takerate - what it is for other platforms and how it fits in headjack beyond youtube

Business models page in ecosystem?




## Content & interface architectures

- store content off-chain ==> infinite horizontal scalability

infinite amounts of content can be anchored & adressable

think of it as a spine/backbone to which everything attaches to


the persistent URL of content is an advertisement of the interface by itself
similar to twitter's client attribution



social networks will become interfaces/views - different compositions of available services that someone pays to have them developed

some level of centralization is required - both for UX and for the sophistication of services. The sheer scale of the public web is daunting.
AWS-like stuff incoming

different AWS-like services will index, process & filter data differently based on different moderation policies. But anyone could enter the business

Social media will be broken by verticals and companies will compete to offer services


Disadvantage: different criteria for counting engagement would result in different views => confusing?

traditional web2 companies/apps/websites will be able to gradually transition and anchor their content into this namespace - cost of entry would be marginal and the first to do so would get indexed and start getting shown in search results in this ecosystem first

    With verifiable computation, these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.
    We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.
