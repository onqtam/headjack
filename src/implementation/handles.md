A global mapping of `handle` (`string`) to X helps resolve queries. X contains:
- 

- maybe they should not be properties of accounts but a separate map structure that just maps handles to IDs and on which block were they acquired? What would be traded - handles on IDs?

if a handle changes hands that shouldn't affect the ID & all the connections (no need to shuffle that much database numbers around)

- `handle` (`string`) - the name of the account
    - currently no idea how to 
    - TODO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle
- `handle_change`





handles can be sold without affecting the interest graph - handles are not accounts.
entire accounts can be also sold with the transition to a new keypair

gradually lowering the cost for new handles, such that it costs 10k$ initially for a handle, and going lower slowly.

Names must be between 1 and 16 characters and can only be made of letters (a-z), numbers(0-9) and underscores (_).

Users acquire a name by making two transactions â€” the first is to commit a secret hash of the username, and the second is to reveal the secret and claim the username to the address. During the reveal phase it also:

backwards-compatibility of the handles - can mimic typical DNS like "twitter.com"

TODO: think about namespaces & hierarchies like in DNS & also ENS - is ENS a namespace?

Another key differentiator is that Handshake is the first to pre-reserve names for existing trademark name holders.

Why is Handshake pre-reserving the top tens of thousands of domain names according to Alexa.com?
TODO: maybe also reserve the top 100k twitter handles?

"The other major problem with Handshake auctions is that they are Vickrey auctions."
"Handshake would be a lot better if it had a bidding system that assumed users were unskilled and naive, and attempted to optimize the outcome for users assuming that they made bad or uninformed decisions."
