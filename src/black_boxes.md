# Black boxes & bias

# Black boxes & algorithmic bias

The recommendation algorithms & the social graph are the architecture of virality - the dynamics of amplification & interaction dictate how ideas surface, propagate, compound & evolve. The people writing the algorithmic feeds are the most powerful in the world - [@naval](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3616).

Ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions & results leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as [Dr. Robert Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies) would [attest](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4q0cNkAHQQMBTu4NmeNW7E) - there is 0 accountability.

> "But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm." - [the original Google search engine whitepaper](https://perma.cc/8GDJ-K6AX)

Does such a search engine exist today? Competition & a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.

The explicit user preferences such as subscriptions & the social graph (following/connections) are routinely discounted in our feeds in favor of algorithm recommendations - platforms optimize for engagement & attention and not for utility & value to end users. We all respond to outrage & enjoy the occasional viral cat video but we should be able to tune & filter what gets shown to us. Have you ever heard a YouTuber tell you to hit the notification bell in addition to subscribing?

Everything will be going fine and then suddenly I'm getting the cold-shoulder and I don't even really know what I did and just have to wait it out." - [Tim Urban](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1506755880578166788)
