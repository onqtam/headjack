# Black boxes & bias

# Black boxes & algorithmic bias

The recommendation algorithms & the social graph are the architecture of virality - the dynamics of amplification & interaction dictate how ideas surface, propagate, compound & evolve. The people writing the algorithmic feeds are the most powerful in the world - [@naval](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3616).

Ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions & results leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as [Dr. Robert Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies) would [attest](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4q0cNkAHQQMBTu4NmeNW7E) - there is 0 accountability.

> "But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm." - [the original Google search engine whitepaper](https://perma.cc/8GDJ-K6AX)

Does such a search engine exist today? Competition & a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.

The explicit user preferences such as subscriptions & the social graph (following/connections) are routinely discounted in our feeds in favor of algorithm recommendations - platforms optimize for engagement & attention and not for utility & value to end users. We all respond to outrage & enjoy the occasional viral cat video but we should be able to tune & filter what gets shown to us. Have you ever heard a YouTuber tell you to hit the notification bell in addition to subscribing?

Everything will be going fine and then suddenly I'm getting the cold-shoulder and I don't even really know what I did and just have to wait it out." - [Tim Urban](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1506755880578166788)

# Problems with specific platforms

A non-exhaustive list of additional problems (beyond what's already listed) with some platforms:

- YouTube:
    - there is no longer a down vote count & like/dislike ratio
    - subscriptions are by now almost meaningless without the notification bell icon
    - the comment section is just an afterthought - they don't care about it
        - the presentation is extremely basic & limiting
        - you cannot even link to a specific comment with a URL
        - financial scams in comments are abundant - moderation is non-existent
- Twitter:
    - we can't even sort the tweets of someone based on engagement
    - we pin threads of threads on our profiles and sequence them with X/YY numbers
    - cannot sort quotes/replies of a tweet based on engagement/age
    - no unrolled thread view option even though it's a no-brainer at this point
    - filtering & tuning what is shown in lists is nonexistent
        - lists don't show replies that are not to accounts in that list
        - can't display likes in lists
    - we [can't see other people's feeds](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1502846781150822402) (although there's this [third-party app](https://vicariously.io/))
    - no way to opt-out of recommendations in the main feed for topics you don't care about or unrelated activity such as `X received a reply from someone you don't follow`
    - find the beginning of [this thread](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1531668215541145601) - is that readable & usable? There should be an alternative Reddit-style application

<!-- tweets & comments without tagging is primitive and inefficient -->

when twitter decide engagement is low they shove down your throat nonsense algorithmic "recent tweets" notifications you can't turn off - that's what it has devolved into. "See less often" from the dropdown menu does nothing. Misaligned incentives.
