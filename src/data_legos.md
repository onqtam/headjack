The public conversation shouldn't be fractured between platforms such as Twitter, YouTube & Reddit - instead it should be one but viewed through different lenses (based on moderation / indexing / visualization). The Twitter view of a discussion is basically the same as just the top level comments (without the children) in a Reddit thread. Segregated discussion in the open web serves nobody - there should be canonical IDs for events & information that we can all refer to. It doesn't make sense that comments can be arbitrarily disabled for some document on one platform (YouTube) but enabled on another one where a URL from the first is shared. All content could be interlinked, deduplicated, referencable, quotable, commentable & shareable.

<!-- Linkedin is literally an attestation network that allows the curation of your skills. Imagine if we merged all the web - you could effectively build your resume based on your public successes and expertise - expertise which is provable. Open global science -->

<!-- view all actions by an account on any platform -->
