# Algorithms, feeds & aggregation

The most important aspect of today's media are the [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) that guide our attention and ultimately our thoughts, opinions & culture at scale. Most algorithms we use are [black boxes](problems_with_the_web.md#black-boxes--algorithmic-bias) - we don't know what they are nor how the ML models are parameterized & trained and if there's any (intentional) bias. And even if that was public information - there would be no way to check because we don't have access to the data either. Furthermore, nobody can build new competing indexes, models & recommendation engines and we're left with the lowest common denominator that optimizes mostly for engagement & time spent in the attention economy.

# Verifiable algorithms, indexes & models

Within Headjack, all public data is freely accessible and the [data network effect](https://mattturck.com/the-power-of-data-network-effects/) is shared by every actor in the ecosystem - anyone can train new ML models, compute views and analyze data in new ways. There will be demand for all kinds of indexes & models but because entry is permissionless a market will appear and the ones that process data the most efficiently will be rewarded. The results of such batch processing jobs could be public or private (available only to those who pay for access) and the product would be verifiable - either optimistically (trust by default but with the option to recreate them and check for equivalence at some cost) or through [verifiable computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing).

> "Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level." - [Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)

# Feeds & home pages

We have no control over what social media shows us - we're presented with their best attempt at engaging us and nothing more. Feeds are primitive/limited and have their own agenda. Once access to data has been democratized we could finally have a choice as new entrants will differentiate themselves in ways that weren't possible before. What if:
- you want [the first thing you see to be a dashboard](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1442863553497554944) with graphs & charts about the things you care about instead of an endless feed to scroll?
- instead of a feed you were shown a map with events grouped by category/people/activity and choose selectively which zones to "zoom" into based on your interest?
- you're interested in all events from the past week - not just those from the last 24 hours?
- you want things sorted differently, or to tune out certain kinds of content?
- you want your video feed to show content that people you follow have engaged with?

# Aggregate sentiment - the big picture

<!-- # Aggregate sentiment, democracy & history -->

The aggregate sentiment on Twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) with the [spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%93ask_spread) being the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) - we could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics and have a societal mirror if not for the current information asymmetry that Big Tech has (point taken [from here](https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=883)). Furthermore, we cannot see the "border" between Twitter and Facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data & backends are private (point taken [from here](https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631)).

With open data systems could show the overlap of communities and focus on what's shared and unites them - bridging the gap, making “the others” less foreign, and reducing polarization. We should be taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism and their [Computational Democracy Project](https://compdemocracy.org/) & [G0v movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v) - building better tools for social consensus - relaxing the culture war. Everything could be visualized through dashboards & graphs - including global [heat maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) of interests & activity based on topic/region/etc. Learning from history & making analogies could be [much more quantifiable and precise](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1557247912874086400) if everything was in [the ledger of record](authenticity.md#the-ledger-of-record).

with open data & transparent algorithms we could leverage AI to surface human collective intelligence at scale in a permissionless way - anyone could analyze the data and prove their results

# Signaling filtration choices

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature.

Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

We can have a choice and simply refuse to use opaque infrastructure & applications that use black box algorithms that are unverifiable.

what if reactions from reputable people were taken into account by recommendation algorithms so that untrue things get downregulated that way?


improving transparency.


ultra virality may be bad
https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1561032192947458048

Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

We can see which indexes other people prefer in terms of applications & their openly advertised preferences. The network state is 100% digital and is publicly expressed through client attribution - choice

We will be able to study the effects of recommendation algorithms for virality because all content has an application where it came from & we would be able to see the public preferences of people for which indexes to use

Applications will compete on the algorithms they let people use to filter and sort information - to look for signal through the noise.

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains/layers of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution
