# Algorithms, feeds & aggregation

The most important aspect of today's media are the [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) that guide our attention and ultimately our thoughts, opinions & culture at scale.

# Algorithms & transparency

Currently most algorithms in use are black boxes - we don't know what they are and we don't know how they're parameterized & trained. And even if we did - there would be no way to check. Furthermore, only the private companies have access to their data and nobody can analyze and build new indexes, models & recommendation engines and we're left with the lowest common denominator that optimizes solely for engagement & time spent on the platforms.

With all public data being shared & accessible by anyone a new market would emerge - that for 

neither now 

the public shouldn't be using black-box recommendation algorithms - we can actually have a choice and choose the transparent ones and they can be really good - we can make a functioning market for those and they can be verifiable

Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data & being able to check the results for yourself

what if reactions from reputable people were taken into account by recommendation algorithms so that untrue things get downregulated that way?

We can build the classifiers in public - the ml models.


# Feeds

dashboards instead of feeds

Instead of a feed the home page could be a dashboard that shows areas of interest of your social graph and being able to selectively dive deeper in whatever you decide - feeds are primitive, extremely limiting, and have their own agenda

one problem with twitter is the immediacy - the feed promotes recent engagement ONLY. and there's no good way to dig through history

We need control over feeds

promotion of videos will no longer be dominated just by the recommendation algorithm - when an influencer comments on a video his followers will see it and watch the said video too

# Aggregate sentiment - the big picture

<!-- # Aggregate sentiment, democracy & history -->

The aggregate sentiment on Twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book) with the [spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%93ask_spread) being the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) - we could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics and have a societal mirror if not for the current information asymmetry that Big Tech has (point taken [from here](https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=883)). Furthermore, we cannot see the "border" between Twitter and Facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data & backends are private (point taken [from here](https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631)).

With open data systems could show the overlap of communities and focus on what's shared and unites them - bridging the gap, making “the others” less foreign, and reducing polarization. We should be taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism and their [Computational Democracy Project](https://compdemocracy.org/) & [G0v movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v) - building better tools for social consensus - relaxing the culture war. Everything could be visualized through dashboards & graphs - including global [heat maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) of interests & activity based on topic/region/etc. Learning from history & making analogies could be [much more quantifiable and precise](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1557247912874086400) if everything was in [the ledger of record](authenticity.md#the-ledger-of-record).

with open data & transparent algorithms we could leverage AI to surface human collective intelligence at scale in a permissionless way - anyone could analyze the data and prove their results

# Signaling filtration choices

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature.

Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

We can see which indexes other people prefer in terms of applications & their openly advertised preferences. The network state is 100% digital and is publicly expressed through client attribution - choice

We will be able to study the effects of recommendation algorithms for virality because all content has an application where it came from & we would be able to see the public preferences of people for which indexes to use

Applications will compete on the algorithms they let people use to filter and sort information - to look for signal through the noise.

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains/layers of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution
