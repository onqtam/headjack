<!-- # The content-centric web -->

<!-- # What the data-centric web unlocks -->
<!-- # Possibilities in the data-centric web -->

# Possibilities with open data

Tying data to identity and making it freely available & outside of silos through content-centric addressing enables tons of composability, functionality & innovation.

# Unified events through different views

The public conversation shouldn't be fractured between platforms such as Twitter, YouTube & Reddit - instead it should be one but viewed through different lenses (based on moderation / indexing / visualization). The Twitter view of a discussion is basically the same as just the top level comments (without the children) in a Reddit thread. Segregated discussion in the open web serves nobody - there should be canonical IDs for events & information that we can all refer to. It doesn't make sense that comments can be arbitrarily disabled for some document on one platform (YouTube) but enabled on another one where a URL from the first is shared. All content could be interlinked, deduplicated, referencable, quotable, commentable & shareable.

# Event streams, subscriptions & notifications

Our minds filter out inconsequential sensations by default but we may tune them in with focus - we should have even greater levels of control in the digital realm. The stream of events for whatever we are interested in needs the most sophisticated filtering and configuration possible and anyone should be able to plug into the global event bus and develop new tools.

In an open data environment anything could become an event stream as long as someone is willing to pay for the processing costs (filtration, transformation, storage):
- edits to a specific document identified by a URI
- references/mentions of an account/entity/word/URI in public documents
- any other type of filtration criteria - thresholds, exclude lists, etc.
- complicated streams can be constructed by transforming/joining others - similar to Kafka

If someone implements speech-to-text and starts transcribing audio episodes and publishing the output it would immediately become available to anyone and would automatically end up being parsed, indexed & pushed through data pipelines. Composability. This is not possible with closed platforms - even if someone was willing to pay the processing costs.

Twitter decided that it needs to boost engagement and forced "recent tweet" notifications on us [without the ability to turn them off](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qwvhhb/how_do_you_disable_recent_tweets_from_x/) - that needs to stop - explicit preferences should be honored.

> "Notifications are just alarm clocks that someone else is setting for you." - [@naval](https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1556179585347112961)

When identity is decoupled from the presentation layer we could have IDMs that align with our needs - we could fine-tune how and when we want to be notified. The incentive for an IDM is not to suck all of our attention (as opposed to interfaces that usually serve ads) - there are other ways to monetize. We'd be able to set a threshold or filter on anything. Subscriptions can be granular & multi-dimensional - like `"show me everything from X unless from interface I or message type T"`. Some IDMs could even offer the feature to show notifications only in specific time ranges of the day - for those addicted to dopamine hits.

# Data-centric interoperability & composability

- We'll be able to plot a timeline for all references to an event and filter based on activity & type of references

persistent URIs help with returning back to a resource and checking all the discussion around it, also checking which of those that you follow have mentioned it

- The lack of data interoperability leads to tool & widget incompatibility

clips... out of context - needs to be fixed!

composing videos from clips with narration without losing the original context - movie maker of sorts

imagine a paragraph of a substack article to be retweetable and to be able to go viral while retaining the context of the whole - this is what composability could enable.

# Usability improvements & organization




# bookmarks & playlists

- universal & permanent bookmarks.
bookmarks & something like logseq on top of this global namespace

playlists are lists of bookmarks

we could have one identity, one set of bookmarks that we manage with something like logseq and we can export stories of deduplicated data points and see the conversations around them.





muted keywords & preferences

quote-retweet something - and then later when viewing the discussion around the original content to be able to view the discussion from quote-retweets 1 level deep as well, or even 2



# Separating data from the presentation layer

- Data can be decoupled from the presentation layer
    - 
    - since message types
We can “version control” frontends and request them by URI from anywhere
Unstoppable software/media









# visualizations

- Imagine the possible visualizations on the graph data of the hivemind
    - imagine a 3d spacial graph of the interconnected knowledge you should learn, and how as you progress you color the edges to the ideas you're studiying on as a progress bar. continue from wherever you want after pausing, explore the datapoints & the interconnectedness. Imagine shipping a 5GB graph in such software for anyone to experience the ideas someone is trying to communicate to them
    - imagine creating explanatory videos for each edge (connections between things in life) - saying how the 2 things interplay, and why
    - imagine wearing a VR headset while constructing your stories as graphs constructed with anchored data

# the semantic web

References are useful beyond peer review - it would be useful for the entire web.

# source code & the global git

github needs to be reimplemented on top of this - open source code is a public good - can be interwoven with peer review and public discourse. Any piece of data/event.

# wikipedia

Wikipedia needs to be rebuilt on this - imagine a q&a section like twitter for every paraphrase and also a git slider to see the history for each paragraph. This index can also be moved interplanetary

wikipedia needs to be git-like. everything can be git-like. new action type: grant ability to someone to "edit" & publish a new version of an item

fork wikipedia?


- imagine wikipedia being rebuilt on top of this
    - dead links? thing of the past - can be cached locally & preserved with merkle proofs
    - imagine wikipedia being forked with a different set of moderators - like in git
    - imagine rebuilding wikipedia on top of this graph and being able to reference each paragraph/change




# science and peer review

- peer review can (and should) be reimplemented on top of infrastructure like this





- the ledger of record - science
    peer review & citations can be encoded with tags/messages

    How does crypto realign science with reproducibility?
    https://twitter.com/manveerbasra_/status/1555405612506157056

    Composable science is reproducible science.
    https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1555458319070167040

    the digital part of scientific papers can be replicatable locally

    digital chain of custody for papers & science

    science should be like open source - replicated & verified many times like code is compiled & ran

    Laws should be referable and commentable. They should be written in public & made available in the same way as open source code is

Imagine having a single id for a film and have comment sections for each chapter or minute


special message tag type: referencing something as a fact - but that thing needs an UUID so ppl can look it up and see what's being commented about it over there



# Queries

- imagine stumbling upon a video and saving it for later viewing. Later you decide to check where it got to you from - how do you query that? in a data-centric world you could run a query asking to see if anyone you follow has shared it



# communities and moderation

- competing "subreddits" on the same topic with different moderators & content policies

- tagged posts with 1 main tag would simply appear both in a reddit-like ranking and subgroup grouping, and also in a twitter-like platform with default rendering (or optionally showing the tag).
