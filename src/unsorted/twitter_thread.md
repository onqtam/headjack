just working on an open social graph that can scale to billions & outcompete a monopoly that stopped innovating after achieving PMF, closed its APIs & ossified - never living up to its full potential. Here we are at the 16th anniversary:

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then markets, clocks & bits. Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species.

A global interest graph that determines how information propagates is perhaps the most important invention for human coordination since the creation of the internet - arguably more important than the information itself.

Twitter never moved forward from a PoC - you can't even sort your own tweets based on interactions. We pin threads of threads on our profiles and sequence them with X/YY numbers. Twitter's response? "add an append button when writing threads". But hey! We can endlessly scroll feeds!

5/10
Network effect monopolies need to be broken down into competing presentation layers by democratizing access to their graphs so that anyone can innovate on top without permission - unlocking a combinatorial explosion of composability and competition.

In a world of gatekeepers:
- outsiders can't contribute features & functionality & improve the status quo
- sortition & filtration algorithms are the black box puppet masters of society - proving bias is extremely hard (@DrREpstein, @socialdilemma_)

7/10
- we have unelected speech police with no accountability & transparency when it comes to censorship & deplatforming individuals & groups

Take it or leave it! There's no "Voice and Exit" for us (@balajis):

We are like an ant colony with a malfunctioning central brain suffering from multiple personality disorder - segregated into fabricated factions, oblivious to game theory/markets/economics/history, playing status games, and running exponential experiments in a finite world.

9/10
Virality needs to be politically & content-neutral. Time to end network effect silos. Twitter's monopoly over the graph is a disservice to humanity - let's do better than "280 characters and likes" for our town square.

10/10
We should be connecting echo chambers and taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism & innovation in social media facilitating public discourse, but on a global level. The design space is boundless. There's no credible solution for scale in the billions. Stay tuned.
