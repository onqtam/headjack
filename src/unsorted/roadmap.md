# Secret master plan - or Tech tree

# Go to market & growth strategy

- first 1k/10k indexes reserved & given with auctions/randomly to influential ppl
    - elon could get index 42 - the answer to the universe


growth hack: show some badge who invited you to the network (and how many people you have invited) - perhaps with some referral link initially?

Strategy: use platform APIs to link web2 platform accounts to a headjack account for a gradual transition - as an overlay
Adapters for current web2 platforma - wrap actions in messages that point to the web2 platform?

- the OAuth-like experience - a major selling point, web2 feel

https://spec.dsnp.org/Roadmap.html

the only web3 identity/social solution that can partner with OAuth/OpenID - and they will signal-boost it

- an open source "twitter core" so that others can spin up competing applications easily

- incentive to be earlier in the system - lower index proves that

- tooling to extract/export/migrate social connections & IDs from other networks?
    https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/social-verifier

- integration guides & tooling for other platforms

- talk at conferences

- countering the "if we build it - they will come" wishful thinking with specifics

- partner with

    https://compdemocracy.org/about/

- status
"Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle."

Headjack - having a lower ID

Oauth as a partner

plan how to enable current websites to gradually migrate to this shared identity layer and data exportability & interoperability

“The open source company”
We do not have enough of a team but will fund the most capable ones who wosh to build - there is plenty of room to capture value - the pie is big enough
We can collectively build this thing in parallel

we're not simply raising capital to build the whole thing on our own - we want to actively fund those that are best fit to compete in this new market. We are a fund as well.

auction the first 10k indexes in different tiers and raise funds

- bootstrapping with ppl will be the hardest problem actually.
    - developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset & how to attract influencers.

TODO: think about
- tech talent
- growth strategy
- do a table with different groups & types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted

having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass
TODO: this goes in the growth strat!


think about a migration strategy for twitter

partner with the internet archive?


Strategy: pay engineers to read the book and interview them on camera after that about what they have learned


need community & product
