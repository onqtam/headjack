Identity managers can still be compromised and wreack havok, but this is annimprovement to the status quo

users should be able to point to their own personal ceramic stream instead of relying on interfaces
    they would need to post on-chain to timestamp their new activity for it to be sequenced & addressable with /user/nonce/...


an IDM may also use a social recovery wallet instead of email as login - or just a normal wallet/keypair authorization

the more you rely on IDMs for features and data storage, the less sovereign you are.


If an IDM does not let users bind keypairs then they will be boycotted

IDMs never get access to your private key

How does one balance DMs across so many platforms?

query IDMs directly for content by person X - polling mechanics like RSS


Permissions for different actions could be separated - for example requiring signatures for content while not requiring for updating follow connections.

The future of mass-market crypto experiences lies within apps that provide familiar, custodial experiences with the ability to graduate into non-custodial experiences.
If the goal is to onboard first-time crypto users, the experience must be custodial â€” at least to start.

IDM - pay to cold-DM someone and be seen


- Blocking - through the IDM?
- how to keep progress of viewing? IDM?
- notifications - what is seen - managed between interfaces - IDM?

edge case: what happens if a big interface suddenly becomes malicious? How can millions of ppl invalidate activity posted through it without clogging the network?
    - force interfaces to bond tokens (proportional to the # of delegators) so that if a fork is necessary, they get penalized.
    - some zero-knowledge way to aggregate signatures for millions that want to batch a transaction delegation event?


SOLVING THIS PROBLEM DeSo have thought about:

sessions as a concept? expiration of delegation?

- DMs without keys - how?
    maybe rely on the identity providers - ACMs?
