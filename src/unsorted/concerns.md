- IDMs could "lock in" users by not adhering to the standards for exporting data

- how to count impressions/views of videos?
- Disadvantage: different criteria for counting engagement would result in different views => confusing?

- what if a specific application is very spammy and infrasturcture blacklists it, but some users use it and expect their creations & edits to be visible elsewhere?

- how to handle the name registration and avoiding hoarding

perhaps spam in email is a harder problem compared to Headjack where everything is tied to identity & it might cost money to create an account?


- Sybil attack - spam, bloat, state growth with dead IDs

    - Pruning?

- moderation

- Image/video hosting/caching

problem: if your content gets bundled up in an IPFS blob from an application and there's CSAM from someone else in it...

Concern with centralization of infrastructure - but theres no way to improve it

Concern: status inequality - even if one platform and set of algorithms let newcomers have a chance, other platforms may not. But maybe it balances on aggregate


- what happens if an event that's not anchored yet becomes illegitimate by an IDM unauthorizing an application before the content is anchored? Confusing for people...

- could it be that checking with proofs all the content might be too much processing? doubt it...

concern: censorship based on infra used - forcing apps to move to the "right" infra with the "right" filtering

concern: with better traceability, censoring events could be easier, but important documents can still circle around with proofs of authenticity

Con: everyone will see the authorized apps?

complexity before the dust settles and things become established ways

possible disruption by account abstraction & ZK stuff?


the lack of financial integration & composability with other chains might be an issue?


# Unintended consequences

anyone analyzing data more easily at scale?
Panopticon as a service?

The cat is out of the bag

ClearviewAI, but on stereoids

what if you by mistake like adult content through your main account and that event gets cached by others - unable to be deleted?

Con: extremely easy to detect the personality type of anyone with high accuracy based on their activity - cambridge analytica on stereoids

with open data anyone could build a classifier and label certain people as gay - without their consent.

Users won't be able to authorize & login to services if the chain is down...

responsibilities and assumptions - users should monotor if apps send their activity to their idm
