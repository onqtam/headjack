# Mission & ambition

Evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point & accelerating exponentially. If finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), then media is the battleground of ideas and is just as fundamental.

At the root of our greatest challenges are [coordination failures](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). We are like an ant colony suffering from multiple personality disorder - trapped in multipolar traps, segregated into fabricated factions, oblivious to game theory/markets/economics/history, plagued by short-sightedness & nihilism, playing status games, and running exponential processes in a finite world.

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then [markets, clocks](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/
) & [bits](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species. If the internet is the information super highway, blockchains are the cooperation super highways and can play a major role in upgrading our systems of trust. We are just neurons - let's bootstrap the hivemind by organizing in a global & borderless super intelligence.

# Goals

<!-- > "Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." - [Google](https://about.google/) -->

<!-- Headjack's mission is to end network effect monopolies & data silos by making identity sovereign and data interoperable. -->

The host-centric status quo is just a local maximum. Goals:

- [distribute power](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1554228316181127169) and let people have a [choice](possibilities.md#forking-media--communities) - identity should belong to no one
- rebuild & scale up trust through [authenticity](authenticity.md) and build the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088)
- revive the [semantic web](possibilities.md#the-semantic-web-aka-the-original-web3), [deduplicate content & enable traceability](authenticity.md#deduplicating-documents--traceability)
- improve transparency - ["Sunlight is the best disinfectant"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant)
    - [virality, feeds & algorithms](problems_with_the_web.md#black-boxes--algorithmic-bias) needs to be politically & content-neutral
- break the [vertical integration](problems_with_the_web.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) through interoperability & markets - allow for specialization
    - lower the barrier to entry for innovation - the design space is limitless
    - enable alternative business models - the monopolistic ad economy is a paperclip maximizer with huge cultural repercussions
- [enable](possibilities.md#query--plot-anything) super users to separate signal from noise through open data & better tooling
- empower storytellers by [improving books and publications](possibilities.md#the-future-of-publishing-knowledge--learning)
- make infrastructure more resilient through [redundancy](possibilities.md#redundancy-scaling--topological-flexibility) and p2p content-addressing
- slay [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) - the god of coordination failures & multipolar traps

<!-- lowest common denominator UX is fine but the power users should be able to go crazy - let them separate signal from noise on a global level -->

# Mission: <u><i>Free data from the host-centric model by linking it to sovereign identity at scale.</i></u>

# Bottom-up media & decentralization

> "Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed." - [source](https://guide.getzion.com/inspiration-for-zion)

Headjack makes identity sovereign and no 2 entities can be prevented from communicating both privately and in public - allowing for [gossip](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129). Authenticity enables global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). ["Information wants to be free"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free) - the entire web can be turned into a crowdsourced Wikipedia where anything is provable, interlinked & commentable. We can reimplement peer review & intertwine it within the global public namespace and make everything visualizable through dashboards.

> "Engelbart’s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time.”" - [Douglas Engelbart](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart)

<!-- > "gossip is simply more important in larger, more stratified, and more institutionalized societies" - [source](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129) -->

<!-- > "The general trajectory of institutionalization associated with steadily increasing specialization, urbanization, and bureaucracy may mean that mass media will continue to rise in importance, playing the role of the juicy gossiper in our increasingly separated existence from one another." - [source](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129) -->

<!-- 
> "If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide."

there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true.

We should be connecting echo chambers and taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism & innovation in social media facilitating public discourse, but on a global level.


We haven't really had a market for ideas


The ability to do specific verifiable attribution to where a harm is coming from can increase our capacity to serve justice
Forced transparency !!!

We can do a lot better with systems of collective intelligence

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records


without proper connectivity, there cannot be a collective consciousness
we need to make it possible for people to build a reputation on truth and follow them
