# Mission & ambition

Evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point & accelerating exponentially. If finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), then media is the battleground of ideas and is just as fundamental.

At the root of our greatest challenges are [coordination failures](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). We are like an ant colony suffering from multiple personality disorder - trapped in multipolar traps, segregated into fabricated factions, oblivious to game theory/markets/economics/history, plagued by short-sightedness & nihilism, playing status games, and running exponential processes in a finite world.

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then [markets, clocks](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/
) & [bits](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species. If the internet is the information super highway, blockchains are the cooperation super highways and can play a major role in upgrading our systems of trust. We are just neurons - let's bootstrap the hivemind by organizing in a global & borderless super intelligence.

# Goals

<!-- > "Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." - [Google](https://about.google/) -->

<!-- Headjack's mission is to end network effect monopolies & data silos by making identity sovereign and data interoperable. -->

The host-centric status quo is just a local maximum. Headjack wants to:

- [distribute power](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1554228316181127169) and let people have a [choice](possibilities.md#forking-media--communities) - identity should belong to no one
- rebuild & scale up trust through [authenticity](authenticity.md) and build the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088)
- revive the [semantic web](possibilities.md#the-semantic-web-aka-the-original-web3), [deduplicate content & enable traceability](authenticity.md#deduplicating-documents--traceability)
- improve transparency - ["Sunlight is the best disinfectant"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant)
    - [virality, feeds & algorithms](problems_with_the_web.md#black-boxes--algorithmic-bias) needs to be politically & content-neutral
- break the [vertical integration](problems_with_the_web.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) through interoperability & markets - allow for specialization
    - lower the barrier to entry for innovation - the design space is limitless
    - enable alternative business models - the monopolistic ad economy is a paperclip maximizer with huge cultural repercussions
- [enable](possibilities.md#query--plot-anything) super users to separate signal from noise through open data & better tooling
- empower storytellers by [improving books and publications](possibilities.md#the-future-of-publishing-knowledge--learning)
- make infrastructure more resilient through [redundancy](possibilities.md#redundancy-scaling--topological-flexibility) and p2p content-addressing
- slay [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) - the god of coordination failures & multipolar traps

# Mission: <u><i>Free data from the host-centric model by linking it to sovereign identity at scale.</i></u>

# Bottom-up media & decentralization










Authenticity is necessary for global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)).


We could engineer a more functioning collective consciousness
we need to make it possible for people to build a reputation on truth and follow them

We should be connecting echo chambers and taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism & innovation in social media facilitating public discourse, but on a global level.
