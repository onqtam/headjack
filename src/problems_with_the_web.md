TODO: Surveillance capitalism

There are other problems that aren't listed in this page but are mentioned in other pages where Headjack shines - incomplete!!!

A centralized org like twitter can be infiltrated by spies to understand who is behind some anonymous account and criticizing their regime

Problems with the web section: human nature or the attention economy

Lack of composability & interoperability

# Problems with the current web

> "The internet changed the topology of human communication, with existing social platforms as a mere proof-of-concepts." - ["Social Web 3" by Zee Prime Capital](https://zeeprime.capital/social-web-3)

The current host-centric web is just a local maximum due to gradient descent.

If you do put them online, there’s very little one can do to ensure they are authentic or valid, especially if you want them to remain authentic across platforms without building special-purpose APIs and integrations." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

> "Problem: The data for {X} is under the total control of company {X}. If a user wants to migrate to a new service, they can’t bring their history with them in a way that retains its legitimacy. Company {X} doesn’t want to let them, and even if they did, it wouldn’t be easy to do this at scale in a way so {X} doesn’t maintain total control. See: Twitter API being public with companies built on it, only to be shut down by Twitter." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

> "I think it might make the world more efficient if we were able to instantly verify the authenticity of assets, licenses, and certificates, without the need for every issuer to run massive APIs and authentication services. All one needs to do to ensure the authenticity of an asset is verify the identity and history of the issuer" - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)
