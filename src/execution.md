Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups donâ€™t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol

The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity & interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus

A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case

No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum & is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains

I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.

finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability & retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block & the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...




- ZK rollup?
- eth2 danksharding?
- mina snapp?
- unbounded state growth.



- look into aggregate/multi/threshold signatures, ZK tech & other certificates:

- ECDSA vs eddsa

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3542/how-are-ethereum-addresses-generated

Ethereum uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called Secp256k1.
the address is the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key.

This ensures that most apps do not end up hosting ECDSA key pairs which create security and regulatory challenges if funds are sent to them on Ethereum.
