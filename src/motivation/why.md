# What's currently wrong

This page focuses on the current problems while the [possibilities](possibilities.md) page focuses on what Headjack would enable.







Engelbart’s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time.”
https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart





true uncensorability. The next philosopher to push humanity forward will be anonymous and global. Imagine not checking out what others are checking out more and more - what are the trends. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE what others are finding most interesting. Most people are rational - let's see what gets the most attention from everyone.




Global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) is important.









human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point - everything important is in our culture & competition happens between ideas. We are building our digital history on shifting sands - there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true. There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible & indexable. A global append-only log for data doesn't have the same requirements as a financial system which needs 100% uptime. The only thing that needs incentivization is data availability & the ability for anyone to offer. There can be different modes of posting - maybe just a hash for content that could be on ipfs and whose contents might have different levels of storage guarantees.



We need everything that needs to bubble up to the top to do so.
sequencing & discoverability is valuable. The ability for any piece of information to bubble up TO THE ABSOLUTE TOP is.. VALUABLE

information theory and physics are interlinked. In the physical world signals traverse based on the natural laws but memetic ideas spread thanks to human-manipulated means - we don't have fair means of dissipation of information. We can't make sense of the world together. We can't coordinate


The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come - steve jobs

Finance and media are the bedrock of society.





the only way to pay for open data is to make a currency that whoever owns it benefits from being on it. Make the voice of people unsilence-able - something pops up - immediately a few people copy it so even if the original goes down - the idea can be re-referenced by others anonymously - until it picks up steam and gets nocited by more

the trust machine may bootstrap the truth machine - where it is incentivized to pop up to the top and the only thing that makes things grow is actually being more interesting & important. HEATMAP of links!



Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.

the same piece of data may pop up multiple times throughout time through different sources - unkillable evidence - one which may live offline for a period and resurface. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOBAL HASH INDEX OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EVER TAGGED?

I want to tag/link/index/sequence all data. I want the truth to bubble up.




imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness. This is the unification



Linked data is essential for discoverability & ingestion of information - this gitbook is an example of that - contrast to what it would be if it was a linear whitepaper. The whole web can be interlinked like this.



Imagine what Balaji could do if he had everything easily referencable through a logseq-like interface



## Decentralization

Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed.

lets try to achieve consensus on ground truth with the ledger of record
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth

Organizing the information on the internet better
Separating signal from noise.

we need to establish objective reality
we shouldn't need steven pinker to make lectures titled "rationality saves lives"
imagine developing a publicly-developed wiki where we collaborate on trying to figure out the best set of documents - the rules that everyone should see.

## Transparency & openness

Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data & being able to check the results for yourself

Identity & the social graph belong to no one

Sunlight is the best disinfectant

"Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level."

If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.

As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.

This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.

The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.

Any of the mentioned articles or quotes by ppl like balaji should have been a notification or reference - everything should be interlinked



"Politics is Downstream from Culture"
"culture is downstream from technology"

Society, business & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity.
https://twitter.com/naval/status/790443306886926337





If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide.

Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
Headjack's mission is to end network effect monopolies & make identity & data interoperable.





> Society can’t understand itself if it can’t be honest with itself, and it can’t be honest with itself if it can only live in the present moment. It’s long overdue to affirm and enact the policies and technologies that will let us see where we’ve been, including and especially where we’ve erred, so we might have a coherent sense of where we are and where we want to go.

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then markets, clocks & bits. Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species.







This is an explicit interest graph where each new connection is a conscious choice by users - as opposed to how a recommendation algorithm learns your preferences and profiles your interests (best example: TikTok).



Yes we all enjoy viral cat videos and whatnot but don’t show it to us without asking or at least let us turn such recommendations off.




























imagine the timelines & graphs we'd be able to construct if we have a global sequencer




## Culture war


Ideas should not be sacred - we are just neurons - global & borderless super intelligence - bootstrapping the global hivemind


The aggregate sentiment on twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity order book - we should want to see the Overton window.
We could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics.
https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=883
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV5SqIm5e90


we cannot see the "border" between twitter and facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data and backends are private and closed/siloed. This can change and we can have greater insights
https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631

Finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), media is the battleground of ideas.






A public backend would be a societal mirror
The information asymmetry needs to be fixed - the twitter backend should be open


Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature

Predstavi si kak vsichki lokalno puskat neptiqtni neshta - shte iskame publichna versiq koqto gi down regluate-va i bihme iskali da review-nem algorituma za bias. Vkarai ideqta za pipelines na data za web infra - verifiable indexes



We can choose our collective shared experience - freedom of information and direct vote for moral values
> "When identities become portable, backends become liquid" - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/coconidodev/status/1504850437727571974)


Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

the way to end polarization is by allowing us to choose and display what unites us
