# Current problems with the web

TODO: get the related parts of the possibilities page in here and link to this page in there

- It will greatly aid the archivability of the web - fighting back the [sand mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala) syndrome.
- Updates/changes to events will be cryptographically provable and browseable throughout time - the global [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git).
- And many more - checkout the [possibilities page](../motivation/possibilities.md).



TODO: Multiple points to retrieve content - redundancy

platform attribution - advertising 
Interface names that were used to publish content can serve as advertising (interface attribution) for the platform that was chosen by a user when content is viewed through other interfaces because the original URIs will be shown and users will be able to click to view each piece of content through the originating interface if they choose to (if they've never heard of it before & are curious or if their current interface doesn't fully support a given message type).

==> discoverability of new interfaces!

TODO: articles can include the data for whatever they reference & even provide the merkle proofs for those - self-contained, complete & permanent publications

This way data is self-certifying 
not just self-certifying data addressable by hash, but also by a pretty URL!

Headjack - free the world's information by making it portable & addressable

interlinking data and allowing different views to be used can reduce the effect of echo chambers

Good addressing intertwined with identity is a strong network effect.

- extensible - sub-addressing for content? fragments?




- archivability
    - data vs entire webpage content
    - push vs pull

todo: talk about URNs used as URLs - if the associated first name has an associated HTTP host
    - but when - at the time of the nonce or the current name? or both?


- indexing
    The block explorers for Headjack would be the next Google.
    block explorers are the future of browsing

- addressing
    - persistent URLs
    STABILITY !!!



















DNS was the original “decentralization” (although not in the crypto sense)


- DNS
    DNS was the original “decentralization”.
    RSS was an attempt for the next iteration
    How do you store your friend list?
    But rss is too technical
    Dns got overloaded too many times




- deduplication




the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) (the OG "Web3")



reinventing the semantic web

linking data is easier under a common global namespace
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data

facilitate the creation of [hyperdata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperdata)

Headjack may offer the ability to give permanent IDs on-chain similar to accounts for concepts & abstract entities in order to facilitate 

An integral part to this vision are the [message types](../implementation/ecosystem/messages.md).





Self-authenticating data provides a scalability advantage by enabling store-and-forward caches. Aggregators in a self-authenticating network can host data on behalf of smaller providers without reducing trust in the data's authenticity. With [verifiable computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing), these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.

Networking can gradually evolve as it is orthogonal to the actual identities and anchoring of content.
