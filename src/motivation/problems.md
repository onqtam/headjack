# Problems with the current web

Today's web is broken on many fronts - here are some of the big ticket items:

## The host-centric vs data-centric web

TODO: link to addressing

Data needs to be liberated from silos and monopolies - make them play on an equal footing and you will get more innovation

## Black boxes & algorithmic bias

The interest graph & recommendation algorithms are the architecture of virality - the dynamics of amplification & interaction dictate how ideas surface, propagate, compound & evolve. The people writing the algorithmic feeds are the most powerful in the world - [@naval](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3616).

Ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions & results leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as [Dr. Robert Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies) would [attest](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4q0cNkAHQQMBTu4NmeNW7E) - there is 0 accountability.

> "But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm." - [the original Google search engine whitepaper](https://perma.cc/8GDJ-K6AX)

Does such a search engine exist today? Competition & a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.

## Vertical integration vs specialization & competition

Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages & trade secrets.

This leads to:
- lack of cooperation, interoperability, duplicated effort & stifled innovation
- competition for scarce talent which leads to sub-par solutions
- company bloat & inefficiencies
    - companies are harder to manage as they are way bigger than what they could be
    - bigger size demands higher revenue - pricing out many business models
- differences in functionality between platforms => complexity for users

Contrast that to open protocols & exportable data where anyone can specialize, innovate & provide the best possible service for a specific vertical & sell it to others. The move from [host-centric](../introduction/host_centric.md) to [data-centric](../introduction/data_centric.md) addressing and open blockchains enable [interoperability](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/) and composability.

## Centralized & fragmented identity

> "Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes." - [source](https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3)

Convenience & simplicity sought by users has lead to extreme levels of centralization of identity in just a few centralized players with [single sign-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) functionality & network effects.

> "as of 2018 the consolidation of power and control over the social web by a few large corporations seems unparalleled" - [Decentralizing the Social Web](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document)

<!-- Note this article on the dangers of the possible commercial centralization of identity was written before Facebook was even founded. -->

<!-- "Yet given programmers had over ten years to address the centralization of social data, why did these efforts fail? To a large extent, the key failing is that the programmers tried to solve the problem of centralization via the purely technical means of standards rather than taking into account the larger social, economic, and political world into which their code was embedded." -->

Contrast that to a world with interoperable & exportable identity/data:

> “each time we go from one social network to another we do not need to restate who we are, what our interests are, or who we know” - [Decentralizing the Social Web](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document)

<!-- No need to rebuild social graphs in every new interface/platform -->

## The cold start problem for media startups

The barrier to entry for most types of media platforms is very high:
- kickstarting a network effect & attracting a critical mass is very difficult
- need to reinvent the wheel & vertically integrate many aspects instead of composing a service from already existing solutions

And thus few companies are started and ever fewer are successful - leading to little innovation, slow progress & sub-par services.

Check out the [case study](startup_case_study.md) expanding on the challenges for such a startup.

## Monopolistic - no alternatives, no voice and exit

Platforms with monopolistic [MOATs](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp) dominate us and don't compete solely on the quality of service as they should.

The incentives in web2 are to run the attract-extract playbook

## Moderation & censorship


arbitrary rules for shadow banning
https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/


Twitter accounts that document Nancy Pelosi's stock trades have been removed multiple times without violating the terms of service.

Content moderation is orthogonal to amplification through algos


## Cultural fragmentation, filter bubbles & echo chambers

Duplicated content

Echo chambers are intellectual oppression - as opposed to idea labs - treating ideas as experiments - as said by tim urban

by making data and identity interoperable between views it gets much easier for people to peek outside of their areas of interest and perhaps get drawn into other aspects of the world. It's all interconnected in the real world anyway, why not interconnect all data too and let ppl swim towards whatever they wish?

The story of our times is fragmentation:
- cultural fragmentation => polarization and radicalization

substack has it's own comment section.
sites that have segregated comment sections:

## Problems with specific platforms

- YouTube:
    - subscriptions are almost meaningless without the bell icon
    - there is no longer a down vote button

- Twitter:
    - no way to remove `X received a reply from someone you don't follow` style of activity from your feed - or any other sort of recommendations
    - find [the beginning](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1531668215541145601) of this thread - is that readable & usable? There should be an alternative Reddit-style interface
