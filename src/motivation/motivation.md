# Motivation (why)

Headjack is an information network. It solves identity & universal sign-on. It is an addressability layer that is agnostic to the means of delivery. It is an index and a historian - the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088).

The following sub-chapters convey the idea (**what**) and a high-level view of how it works:

1. [Problems with the current web](../motivation/problems.md)

3. [Infrastructure improvements](../motivation/infrastructure.md)
4. [Unlocked possibilities](../motivation/possibilities.md)
5. [Startup case study](../motivation/startup_case_study.md)
6. [Philosophy](../motivation/philosophy.md)
7. [The ambition](../motivation/ambition.md)
