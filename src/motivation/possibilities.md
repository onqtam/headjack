# A list of what could be possible


imagine stumbling upon a video and saving it for later viewing. Later you decide to check where it got to you from - how do you query that? in a data-centric world you could run a query asking to see if anyone you follow has shared it


hope for spam & moderation: if there is a market for it it could be solved faster as compared when a monopoly has to deal with that - like with spam and email - anyone can build tools to fight spam in email


it doesn't make sense to not be possible to comment on anything in the web and not have your followers see it. simply doesn't

"diff" view that summarizes the changes to a URI over time (the updates/edits)
TODO: look at this:
We've got a pretty solid diff view now, notes at https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/ and an example at https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches





























## No more data silos

Generating content should be frictionless. Associating content with identity should be straightforward. Frictionless migration between views

all content should be referencable, sub-quotable, commentable & share-able

We should be able to refer to content uniquely and see the discussion around it

The conversation around a piece of media shouldn't be segregated between Twitter, YouTube & Reddit - it should be 1 viewed through different lenses.

The Twitter view of a discussion is basically the same as just the top level comments for a thread (without showing the children) in Reddit.

segregated and disjoint discussion in the open web serves nobody - there should be canonical IDs for events & information that we can all refer to and discussion can revolve around them

- competing "subreddits"on the same topic with different moderators & content policies

- tagged posts with 1 main tag would simply appear both in a reddit-like ranking and subgroup grouping, and also in a twitter-like platform with default rendering (or optionally showing the tag).

you should be able to quote-comment any piece of science or media and have a threaded conversation with everyone. All publishing platforms will be plugged into this ecosystem.

## Data-centric interoperability & composability

- We'll be able to plot a timeline for all references to an event and filter based on activity & type of references

persistent URIs help with returning back to a resource and checking all the discussion around it, also checking which of those that you follow have mentioned it

- The lack of data interoperability leads to tool & widget incompatibility


## Sub-addressing TODO: change this name

OMG
quoting sub-sections of pages through the internet archive

HOW TO LINK TO THIS CLIP IN A BETTER WAY?!?!?!

clips... out of context - needs to be fixed!

composing videos from clips with narration without losing the original context - movie maker of sorts

imagine a paragraph of a substack article to be retweetable and to be able to go viral while retaining the context of the whole - this is what composability could enable.

TODO: think about memes & the original content + layers

## Usability improvements & organization

each interface will specialize into providing the best possible service for the particular need/aspect of data consumption


Our minds filter out inconsequential sensations by default but we may tune them in if we so choose to - we should have the same (or greater) level of control in the digital realm. The stream of events for the things we are interested in needs the most sophisticated filtering and configuration possible and anyone should be able to plug into the event bus and develop new tools.




a slider for filtering/jumping through time like in discourse
https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096/231

you can't link to a youtube comment - think about how limiting and yet obvious that is - comments there are just an afterthought

- universal & permanent bookmarks.
bookmarks & something like logseq on top of this global namespace

playlists are lists of bookmarks

muted keywords & preferences
https://twitter.com/AltcoinPsycho/status/1547203030185017344


we could have one identity, one set of bookmarks that we manage with something like logseq and we can export stories of deduplicated data points and see the conversations around them.

every journalist should be able to use something like logseq and construct their stories with referencable facts - timestamped & crypto provable

Write about the story for a journalist using a tool like that and constructing interlinked stories... that needs a page on its own

quote-retweet something - and then later when viewing the discussion around the original content to be able to view the discussion from quote-retweets 1 level deep as well, or even 2

lowest common denominator UX is fine but the power users should be able to go crazy - let them separate signal from noise on a global level


- Data can be decoupled from the presentation layer
    - 
    - since message types
We can “version control” frontends and request them by URI from anywhere
Unstoppable software/media









- notifications for data references being referenced
    data could be any data/resource/ID
    with filtering
    imagine being able to follow the activity of X person on any possible online venue - the all-encompassing public record
- editors & all forms of media will be able to refer to specific posts uniquely
    - something like #seq!<interface_id/interface_nonce/user_id/content_stuff> which could prompt an index lookup in your editor
        - along with competing indexers
    References are useful beyond peer review - it would be useful for the entire web.
- imagine wikipedia being rebuilt on top of this
    - dead links? thing of the past - can be cached locally & preserved with merkle proofs
    - imagine wikipedia being forked with a different set of moderators - like in git
    - imagine rebuilding wikipedia on top of this graph and being able to reference each paragraph/change
- being able to subscribe to changes of pages in websites that don't have an ID (not through follow (because they don't have an ID) but by other means)
- Imagine the possible visualizations on the graph data of the hivemind
    - imagine a 3d spacial graph of the interconnected knowledge you should learn, and how as you progress you color the edges to the ideas you're studiying on as a progress bar. continue from wherever you want after pausing, explore the datapoints & the interconnectedness. Imagine shipping a 5GB graph in such software for anyone to experience the ideas someone is trying to communicate to them
    - imagine creating explanatory videos for each edge (connections between things in life) - saying how the 2 things interplay, and why
    - imagine wearing a VR headset while constructing your stories as graphs constructed with anchored data
- you'll have the option to subscribe (not on-chain but through an interface) to quotes & references of content that interest you - seeing what the reception is and how that unfolds








Different systems with their own cryptoeconomics can be implemented on top of this addressing - adding guarantees for services while still under the same global addressing namespace


There will be a marketplace for every vertical - we need to democratize specialization & competition






concept namespaces - being able to address by index things in a database from account
imdb haedjack idx: 566
the matrix:
    https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/
    566/schema/<movie_schema_number>/0133093
    contrast `<account_index>/<some_string_like_schema>` to `<account_index>/<integer_nonce>`


wikipedia needs to be git-like. everything can be git-like. new action type: grant ability to someone to "edit" & publish a new version of an item

fork wikipedia?

github needs to be reimplemented on top of this - open source code is a public good - can be interwoven with peer review and public discourse. Any piece of data/event.

- peer review can (and should) be reimplemented on top of infrastructure like this


Imagine having a single id for a film and have comment sections for each chapter or minute


special message tag type: referencing something as a fact - but that thing needs an UUID so ppl can look it up and see what's being commented about it over there
