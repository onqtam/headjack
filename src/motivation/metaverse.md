# The metaverse


Games will be able to check your wallet and change your experience depending on what you’ve acquired in other games. Games built by third-party indie devs could be built around the objects of other games, in a literal way extending the game's universe.

the visual metaverse could be built on top of headjack and nvidia's omniverse

the early web was built on open protocols - and so will the metaverse


> "The “metaverse” as I like to envision it, is a globally shared and permanent digital reality not owned by any single entity that any company, platform, or person can plug into, regardless of where they are or what device they’re using." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)


metaverse page
- This is what the metaverse will be built on
- The metaverse is about provable activity linked to identity beyond the confines of any specific platform
- The metaverse is fully addressable and people create more than they transact
- The metaverse is being able to refer to anything and anyone.
- The metaverse is about agency in creation
- TODO: read this from "The Coming Evolution of Games" onward:

We need to persistently link activity with identity to build reputation systems


> "We think of the metaverse as the entirety of all composable and interoperable resources, identities, applications, platforms, services, and protocols that exist in cyberspace."
