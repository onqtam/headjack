# Philosophy

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then [markets, clocks](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/
) & [bits](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species.

<!-- (borrowed from [Sreeram Kannan](https://youtu.be/DikrWN39Hts?t=106)) -->

Human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point and is accelerating exponentially - media is fundamental to culture.

We are like an ant colony with a malfunctioning central brain suffering from multiple personality disorder - segregated into fabricated factions, oblivious to game theory/markets/economics/history, plagued by short-sightedness & nihilism, playing status games, and running exponential experiments in a finite world.



If the internet is the information super highway, blockchains are the cooperation super highways and can play a major role in upgrading our systems of trust. We are just neurons - let's bootstrap the global hivemind by organizing in a global & borderless super intelligence.

Headjack's mission is to end network effect monopolies & data silos by making identity & data interoperable. The status quo is a disservice to humanity. Goals:

- distribute power and let people have a choice - identity should belong to no one
- add [authenticity](authenticity.md) to information, build the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088) and improve accountability
- improve transparency - ["Sunlight is the best disinfectant"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant)
    - virality needs to be politically & content-neutral
- break the [vertical integration](problems.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) through interoperability & markets
    - lower the barrier to entry for innovation - the design space is boundless
    - empower super users to separate signal from noise
    - the monopolistic ad economy is a paperclip maximizer with huge cultural repercussions and needs alternatives
- make infrastructure more resilient

Let's do better than "280 characters and likes" for our town square.








there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true.




visualize the global HEATMAP of interests



Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.




imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness.






## Decentralization

> "Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed." - [source](https://guide.getzion.com/inspiration-for-zion)

Global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) is important.


we need to establish objective reality
imagine developing a publicly-developed wiki where we collaborate on trying to figure out the best set of documents - the rules that everyone should see.

## Transparency & openness

Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data & being able to check the results for yourself





<!-- 
> "If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide."

"Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level."

Any of the mentioned articles or quotes by ppl like balaji should have been a notification or reference - everything should be interlinked
























imagine the timelines & graphs we'd be able to construct if we have a global sequencer




## Culture war




The aggregate sentiment on twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity order book - we should want to see the Overton window.
We could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV5SqIm5e90


we cannot see the "border" between twitter and facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data and backends are private and closed/siloed. This can change and we can have greater insights
https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631

Finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), media is the battleground of ideas.

We can build systems that show the overlap of communities and not focus only on the differences - bridging the gap and making “the others” less foreign





A public backend would be a societal mirror
The information asymmetry needs to be fixed - the twitter backend should be open


Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature.




Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

the way to end polarization is by allowing us to choose and display what unites us

There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible & indexable.


We should be connecting echo chambers and taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism & innovation in social media facilitating public discourse, but on a global level.
