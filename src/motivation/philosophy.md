Headjack's mission is to make identity & data interoperable which will end network effect monopolies & data silos - unlocking creativity & innovation in media.

Identity & the social graph belong to no one













Global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) is important.




lets try to achieve consensus on ground truth with the ledger of record
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth







human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point - everything important is in our culture & competition happens between ideas. We are building our digital history on shifting sands - there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true. There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible & indexable. A global append-only log for data doesn't have the same requirements as a financial system which needs 100% uptime. The only thing that needs incentivization is data availability & the ability for anyone to offer. There can be different modes of posting - maybe just a hash for content that could be on ipfs and whose contents might have different levels of storage guarantees.



information theory and physics are interlinked. In the physical world signals traverse based on the natural laws but memetic ideas spread thanks to human-manipulated means - we don't have fair means of dissipation of information. We can't make sense of the world together. We can't coordinate





visualize the global HEATMAP of interests



Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.


"Information wants to be free"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free


the same piece of data may pop up multiple times throughout time through different sources - unkillable evidence - one which may live offline for a period and resurface. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOBAL HASH INDEX OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EVER TAGGED?

I want to tag/link/index/sequence all data. I want the truth to bubble up.




imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness.



Linked data is essential for discoverability & ingestion of information - this gitbook is an example of that - contrast to what it would be if it was a linear whitepaper. The whole web can be interlinked like this.





## Decentralization

Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed.

Organizing the information on the internet better
Separating signal from noise.

we need to establish objective reality
we shouldn't need steven pinker to make lectures titled "rationality saves lives"
imagine developing a publicly-developed wiki where we collaborate on trying to figure out the best set of documents - the rules that everyone should see.

## Transparency & openness

Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data & being able to check the results for yourself



Sunlight is the best disinfectant

> "If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide."

"Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level."

JBP: Why Twitter Is Insane

Any of the mentioned articles or quotes by ppl like balaji should have been a notification or reference - everything should be interlinked





































TODO: twitter thread




The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then markets, clocks & bits. Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species.

blockchains can play a major role in upgrading our systems of cooperation and trust

if the internet is the information super highway, blockchains are the cooperation super highways

(borrowed from [Sreeram Kannan](https://youtu.be/DikrWN39Hts?t=106))










clickbait?









imagine the timelines & graphs we'd be able to construct if we have a global sequencer




## Culture war


Ideas should not be sacred - we are just neurons - global & borderless super intelligence - bootstrapping the global hivemind


The aggregate sentiment on twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity order book - we should want to see the Overton window.
We could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics.
https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=883
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV5SqIm5e90


we cannot see the "border" between twitter and facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data and backends are private and closed/siloed. This can change and we can have greater insights
https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631

Finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), media is the battleground of ideas.

We can build systems that show the overlap of communities and not focus only on the differences - bridging the gap and making “the others” less foreign





A public backend would be a societal mirror
The information asymmetry needs to be fixed - the twitter backend should be open


Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature.




Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

the way to end polarization is by allowing us to choose and display what unites us
