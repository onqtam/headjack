# Business models

# Ads

The goal is democratized access, competition & innovation - not the end of the ad model which is a pipe dream.


The goal is not to kill the ad model - it is to make everything authentic and allow for better UI and choice and enable the web to step on this

the ad model isn't going anywhere but we are in a "take it or leave" situation without choice - the goal is to fix that


> "Internet monetization is somewhat like a Soviet election: It doesn’t matter who clicks and where, it’s who counts those clicks that matters. The technology and business of that counting of clicks (and everything else you do online besides) goes by the dull-sounding name of attribution, and it determines the fate of trillion-dollar companies." - [source](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll)


> "A recent example of questionable attribution: I tweeted about my e-mountain bike, Jason Calacanis (of all people) saw it and asked about the model. Someone posted a review from bikeradar.com, and Jason (I don’t know if this is true) probably googled for it and maybe bought it. Who deserves the attributions credit? According to Google (surprise, surprise), it’ll be Google … and they’ll take all the credit, which is why Google is worth so much and Twitter so little." - [source](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll)


de-duplication through content addressing & adding traceability of content helps paint the picture what happened when and by who - aiding attribution. Infrastructure companies on which interfaces get deployed on can handle such tracking within them but since all the data is openly broadcasted competing services could offer alternative business models.

> "Whether it be circulation numbers for 19th-century newspapers (the start of the printed ads business), or Nielsen ratings for pre-cable TV that determined ads rates there, there’s never been a media ecosystem that didn’t have attribution." - [source](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll)


> "If you had to conjure some collective mechanism for storing aggregated data that was selectively shareable between publisher and advertiser, it would look much like a blockchain." - [source](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll)

^^ this can be done through verifiable computation & sharing indexes between publishers & advertisers within index infrastructure.

[This article](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll) posits that attribution has to go on-chain but Headjack offers an alternative - through the infrastructure companies.

such infrastructure 



> "For as long as humans have crafted disembodied versions of their voices, whether it be Pompeiian graffiti or the latest tweet, there have been attempts to both guide user attention in some remunerative direction, and measure the effectiveness of that attention-gathering." - [source](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/everything-is-an-ad-network)

> "The attention economy has always had its ledger and its cash register, and Web 3 will be no different."


## Client attribution

the way for a startup interface to get noticed







Ads themselves are not the root evil - it's the lack of choice & ability to exit in the current monopolistic world due to the benefits of vertical integration in the current host-centric paradigm

## IDMs & storage - the new cloud

the open nature of data leads to a shared data network effect where anyone can train ML models at scale with high quality data

creators will need to shift how they monetize because there won't be platform lock-in & attribution :/
or actually the interface attribution for content naturally leads to users checking it out - creators can and should be paid to generate content through them and based on virality of content they could get paid out? omg.
