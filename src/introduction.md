# Headjack - the base layer of cyberspace

Headjack is an [open state database](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640) designed for [web-scale](introduction/web_scale.md) media (in the billions of users) that addresses the most fundamental pieces of the puzzle: identity, connections, names and [content addressing](introduction/addressing.md) with human-readable & persistent [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) paths (instead of hashes) all packaged in a credibly neutral & self-sustaining blockchain. It is [aiming](introduction/ambition.md) to disaggregate the giants and end network effect monopolies & data silos by aligning incentives and striking the right balance of tradeoffs. It is engineered from first principles - building up from the data to support billions of users and a [customer obsession](https://twitter.com/arvanaghi/status/1537519858233008128) for the best UX - there will be no mass adoption without retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to.

The following sub-chapters convey the idea (**what**) and a high-level view of how it works:
- [On-chain vs off-chain](introduction/on_off_chain.md)
- [Guiding principles](introduction/principles.md)
- [Identity & authorization](introduction/identity.md)
- [Content addressing](introduction/addressing.md)
    - [Today's web: host-centric](introduction/host_centric.md)
    - [The data-centric ledger of record](introduction/data_centric.md)
    - [Blob structure & addressing](introduction/blob_structure.md)
    - [Permanent URIs](introduction/uris.md)
    - [Names & paths](introduction/names_and_paths.md)
    - [Benefits of this approach](introduction/benefits.md)
- [Web-scale & UX](introduction/web_scale.md)
- [Competition](introduction/competition.md)
- [The ambition](introduction/ambition.md)

But the vision would be incomplete without the subsequent [**why**](motivation/why.md) and more detailed [**how**](blockchain.md).
