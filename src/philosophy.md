# Philosophy

The ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers has led us to an evolutionary advantage - first through stories and then [markets, clocks](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/
) & [bits](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). Any mechanism that makes those more efficient will benefit the species. Evolution is 99.9% memetic & accelerating exponentially - media is fundamental.

<!-- (borrowed from [Sreeram Kannan](https://youtu.be/DikrWN39Hts?t=106)) -->

We are like an ant colony with a malfunctioning central brain suffering from multiple personality disorder - trapped in multipolar traps, segregated into fabricated factions, oblivious to game theory/markets/economics/history, plagued by short-sightedness & nihilism, playing status games, and running exponential experiments in a finite world.

If the internet is the information super highway, blockchains are the cooperation super highways and can play a major role in upgrading our systems of trust. We are just neurons - let's bootstrap the hivemind by organizing in a global & borderless super intelligence.

# Mission

> "Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." - [Google](https://about.google/)

Headjack's mission is to end network effect monopolies & data silos by making identity & data sovereign & interoperable. The status quo is just a local maximum. Goals:

- [distribute power](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1554228316181127169) and let people have a choice - identity should belong to no one
- add [authenticity](authenticity.md) to information and build the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088) for greater accountability
- revive the semantic web, [deduplicate content & enable traceability](authenticity.md#deduplicating-documents--traceability)
- improve transparency - ["Sunlight is the best disinfectant"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sunlight_is_the_best_disinfectant)
    - virality needs to be politically & content-neutral
- break the [vertical integration](problems_with_the_web.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) through interoperability & markets - allow for specialization
    - lower the barrier to entry for innovation - the design space is limitless
    - enable alternative business models - the monopolistic ad economy is a paperclip maximizer with huge cultural repercussions
- empower super users to separate signal from noise through open data & better tooling
- make infrastructure [more resilient](https://decrypt.co/107293/taiwan-turns-to-ipfs-tech-to-thwart-cyberattacks-from-china) through content-addressing & p2p decentralization

<!-- Mission: minimize friction, complexity, and uncertainty -->

# Bottom-up media & the decentralized town square

> "Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed." - [source](https://guide.getzion.com/inspiration-for-zion)

Headjack makes identity sovereign and no 2 entities can be prevented from communicating both privately and in public - allowing for [gossip](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129). Authenticity enables global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)). ["Information wants to be free"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free) - the entire web can be turned into a crowdsourced Wikipedia where anything is provable, interlinked & commentable. We can reimplement peer review & intertwine it within the global public namespace and make everything visualizable through dashboards.

<!-- > "gossip is simply more important in larger, more stratified, and more institutionalized societies" - [source](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129) -->

<!-- > "The general trajectory of institutionalization associated with steadily increasing specialization, urbanization, and bureaucracy may mean that mass media will continue to rise in importance, playing the role of the juicy gossiper in our increasingly separated existence from one another." - [source](https://publications.hse.ru/en/articles/135571129) -->

> "If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide."

JBP: Why Twitter Is Insane

Any of the mentioned articles or quotes by ppl like balaji should have been a notification or reference - everything should be interlinked









there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true.




visualize the global HEATMAP of interests






# Culture war




The aggregate sentiment on twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity order book - we should want to see the Overton window.
We could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics.

we cannot see the "border" between twitter and facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data and backends are private and closed/siloed. This can change and we can have greater insights

Finance is the [market for promises](https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/the-market-for-promises), media is the battleground of ideas.

We can build systems that show the overlap of communities and not focus only on the differences - bridging the gap and making “the others” less foreign





A public backend would be a societal mirror
The information asymmetry needs to be fixed - the twitter backend should be open


Imagine saying hey lets say all together to choose the filters we want

Imagine being able to select prisms 2, r and 7 - as filters. Clients can be competing chains of filters for the web. - we can choose what subset to use and advertise through attribution

We need to collectively regulate what is in our media - by choice. By competing public algo and by client attribution.

Client attribution is the killer feature.




Moderation filters will simply be that - collections of preferences that users can choose to amplify or die down

the way to end polarization is by allowing us to choose and display what unites us

There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible & indexable.


We should be connecting echo chambers and taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism & innovation in social media facilitating public discourse, but on a global level.


We havent really had a market for ideas
