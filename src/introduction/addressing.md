# Content addressing

The move from host-centric to data-centric addressing is a complete paradigm shift and is perhaps the most important aspect of Headjack. It's been broken down into a few sub-chapters:

- [Today's web: host-centric](host_centric.md)
- [The data-centric ledger of record](data_centric.md)
- [Blob structure & addressing](blob_structure.md)
- [Permanent URIs](uris.md)
- [Names & paths](names_and_paths.md)
- [Benefits of this approach](benefits.md)
