# Addressability: host/app vs data/name centric


A major component of Headjack is how the off-chain content is addressed.



- DNS
    DNS was the original “decentralization”.
    RSS was an attempt for the next iteration
    How do you store your friend list?
    But rss is too technical
    Dns got overloaded too many times

TODO: NOT app-centric! because headjack's interfaces should be called applications and applications aren't hosts

- host/app-centric vs data/name centric
    We are dominated by platforms & applications when in reality data is the most important thing - we need to be able to address it.
    host/app-centric addressing needs to go away.

    The web should move away from the host (ip/domain) and application-specific model towards data-centric

    NDN lacks a global name registry

    - deduplication
- names/handles


- archivability, shifting sands
    - data vs entire webpage content
    - push vs pull
    
    Include a case study with balaji and his post with archived links for permanence - all the data could even be bundled with crypto proofs
    case study: Balaji uses the interet archive for stable links to some of the links
    
    
    Balaji is future-proofing his writings by using archived URLs by default when referring to articles even though they are still around!
    [Example](https://balajis.com/synthesis/): look what `"Prussian"` in that text is [pointing to](https://archive.ph/O2D45).

- indexing
    The block explorers for Headjack would be the next Google.
    block explorers are the future of browsing

- addressing
    - stable URLs
    STABILITY !!!
    - extensible

TODO: talk about PUSH vs PULL & how that relates to RSS - on the main page.

The network effect is not related to data fetching and the implementation of that but of stable data addressing and user connections.






not just self-certifying data addressable by hash, but also by a pretty URL!






Headjack - free the world's information by making it portable & addressable


Data needs to be removed from the grip of host/app-centric monopolies

interlinking data and allowing different views to be used will reduce the effect of echo chambers

reinventing the semantic web

data-centric architectures are a paradigm shift




Stable URLs, deduplicating content & anchoring everything to a single backbone greatly improves the indexability of the web.

the addition of a global singleton of access control management and key registry solves a lot of problems in NDN around security

headjack is the index for web-scale content/information centric networking
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking







A global index of all content throughout time in an Information-centric network - a form of named data networking layered on top of the current host-centric model (client-server connections through IP & DNS)

Differences from NDN: builds on the current internet infrastructure, doesn't have the same packet types and routing concepts - utilizes technologies that are currently available.

linking data is easier under a common global namespace
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data

linking data based on URIs in a host-centric internet architecture is inherently flawed - needs to be in a named data paradigm

The core of ADX is self-authenticating data. In law, a “self-authenticating” document requires no extrinsic evidence of authenticity. In computer science, an “authenticated data structure” can have its operations independently verified. When resources in a network can attest to their own authenticity, then that data is inherently live – that is, canonical and transactable – no matter where it is located. This is a departure from the connection-centric model of the Web, where information is host-certified and therefore becomes dead when it is no longer hosted by its original service. Self-authenticating data moves authority to the user and therefore preserves the liveness of data across every hosting service.
