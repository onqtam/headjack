# Benefits of Headjack's addressing

TODO: Multiple points to retrieve content - redundancy

platform attribution - advertising 
Interface names that were used to publish content can serve as advertising (interface attribution) for the platform that was chosen by a user when content is viewed through other interfaces because the original URIs will be shown and users will be able to click to view each piece of content through the originating interface if they choose to (if they've never heard of it before & are curious or if their current interface doesn't fully support a given message type).

==> discoverability of new interfaces!

TODO: articles can include the data for whatever they reference & even provide the merkle proofs for those - self-contained, complete & permanent publications

This way data is self-certifying 
not just self-certifying data addressable by hash, but also by a pretty URL!

Headjack - free the world's information by making it portable & addressable

interlinking data and allowing different views to be used can reduce the effect of echo chambers

Good addressing intertwined with identity is a strong network effect.

- extensible - sub-addressing for content? fragments?




- archivability
    - data vs entire webpage content
    - push vs pull



- indexing
    The block explorers for Headjack would be the next Google.
    block explorers are the future of browsing

    - stable URLs
    STABILITY !!!

TODO: talk about PUSH vs PULL & how that relates to RSS - on the main page.



Self-authenticating data provides a scalability advantage by enabling store-and-forward caches. Aggregators in a self-authenticating network can host data on behalf of smaller providers without reducing trust in the data's authenticity. With [verifiable computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing), these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.
