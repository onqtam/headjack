# Today's web: host-centric

Today's web revolves around hosts & [unicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast) communication - we query [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) to get the [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of servers and open direct connections with them to retrieve the data that they host. But domains, URI paths on servers & the actual files all change & go away which leads to [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) & content drift. Guidance such as ["Cool URIs don't change"](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI) is just that - guidance - and the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive) is just a bandaid that can hardly keep up with the digital [memory hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole). In the host-certified paradigm URLs at best point to a location at which a document may have been available at a point in time - devoid of any cryptographic proofs regarding the contents, the creator, or the time of publication (as opposed to [self-authenticating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document) data) and everything lives in [silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo) with no interoperability which severely limits the possible innovation and composability on the web and leads to fragmentation of the public discussion (if any). In fact ["more than 98% of the information on the web is lost within 20 years"](https://a16z.com/2020/07/13/a16z-podcast-preserving-digital-history-how-to-close-the-webs-memory-hole/).

> "The problem is that the foundations are shifting sands, and we need something that has significantly more integrity at the bottom layer, we can't just bolt [URNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name) on as an afterthought. Some organizations are able to maintain persistent data over time, but it is in spite of the technology, not because of it." - [tgbugs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27691442).

Information is fragile without an ecosystem of identity, reputation, references, context & liability - our digital history lacks a solid foundation. We can't expect everyone to be like [Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis) - linking to articles from the Internet Archive ([Example](https://balajis.com/synthesis/): look what `"Prussian"` in that text is [pointing to](https://archive.ph/O2D45)) - this doesn't scale, data is not self-authenticating and is still reliant on a central point of failure.

The internet is a [collective hallucination](https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/2019-06_zittrainIP.pdf) and is rotting - a few great quotes from [this piece](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/):

> Society can’t understand itself if it can’t be honest with itself, and it can’t be honest with itself if it can only live in the present moment.

> People tend to overlook the decay of the modern web, when in fact these numbers are extraordinary—they represent a comprehensive breakdown in the chain of custody for facts.
