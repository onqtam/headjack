# Account preferences & graph

how it gets managed by IDMs (so they will also touch IPFS?!)

public vs private

interest graph & how it works off-chain

TODO: change interest graph related things in other pages & pictures

- per account graph state? a materialized tree of the current state based on all prior events - both off-chain & on-chain?

- remove the focus on the interest graph - it will be off-chain!
    - also from all graphics!




1 of N requirement for keeping the interest graph intact & being able to recover it from somewhere


the graph could be moved on-chain if there are many MB/s of DB throughput (possibly sharding) but that would put a lot of strain on the 


myspace-like page  (or linktree-like) where you paint the picture of you - as a map or as whatever - but content shouldn't be owned by separate platforms
