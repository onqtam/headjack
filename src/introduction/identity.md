# Identity & authorization

There are 3 types of roles in Headjack (although a single entity may play all 3):
- Normal accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.
- [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, follow relationships, updating keypairs) & acting as [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) - authorizing interfaces to post on behalf of users (& ability to revoke the authorization).
- Interfaces - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an [IDM](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).

All follow relationships & authorizations are represented & submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (`2131 => 83253, 6331 => 14415`) that get aggregated in compact blobs & signed in bulk by [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) & interfaces - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==> improving the throughput in the valuable block space. Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering & exclusion of content based on its type/tag or interface that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.

So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers & merkle roots for content.

With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:

- Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) & interfaces with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool & pay for transactions if they wish).
- Users won't need wallets & keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) & use email/pass or Web2 [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (`"login with Google"`) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - "owned" by the custodian. Users will be able to "log in" to interfaces using their IDM as [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) for Headjack which will authorize the interface with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/connections/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers & bit flags submitted by the [IDM](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md)) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).
- Users can revoke permissions to interfaces and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an interface by saying `"discard activity generated through interface Y from block X forward"` through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain [such data is non-financial](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173) and fake activity has smaller consequences - in the current Web2 world we've accepted that possibility anyway.
- At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their [IDM](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md). Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) & even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.
- Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair & paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) - not revealing anything.
- Interfaces will be usable by users that don't use an [IDM](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) but all their activity will need explicit signatures - updating follow connections on-chain will be more costly because they'll take a lot more bytes but the requirement of signatures will not impact the cost of off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions).

In practice we expect that only cypherpunks & people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly connections & authorizations) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.

The vast majority of users will be light-weight: consumers & curators of content (through interactions & reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. Their subscriptions/interests matter most, but at any point in time they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath interfaces.

Key & session management (rotation, authorization & revocation) [require](https://blog.ceramic.network/key-revocation-in-self-certifying-protocols/) ordering that is [logically centralized](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274). This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (`"X follows Y"` only affects `X`) and that is [provable with easy to grasp napkin math](../implementation/scaling.md). It is compatible with any type of [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) - anything could be associated with an integer ID. The on-chain authorization has incredible synergy with the human-readable & persistent [addressing](addressing.md) for off-chain content.

A key point is that in Headjack all connections in the [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) are asymmetric and also visible & on-chain as it is geared towards [public discourse](https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks) but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - either on-chain (although much more costly & complex) or handled & stored by [IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect. Identities will have their own customized landing pages - provided either on-chain or off-chain through an IDM - [Linktree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree) is [valued at 1.3B$](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/) and is just a bandaid for todayâ€™s fragmentation of identity on the internet.
