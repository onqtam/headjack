# Guiding principles

There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption & parity on convenience & UX with Web2 services:

- Aggregation and scale cannot be an afterthought - must be scalable to billions of users and that must be [obvious & provable](../implementation/scaling.md) if entrepreneurs  are expected to jump on the opportunity. `"Developers care about risk."` - [Haseeb](https://haseebq.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/)
- Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices & explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers ([IDMs](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md)) using email & pass / [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) (`"login with Google"`) and would then be using these IDMs as [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) to authorize interfaces to post on their behalf. RSS was [too technical](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008) and it failed - [`"people jumped ship as soon as something better came along"`](https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss).

- Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data & blockchain interactions by default - costs & complexity should be shifted to services.
- Users should be able to own their identity & connections in a sovereign way with a keypair **even if by default** their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.
- Anyone should be able to have a pseudonymous identity, operate an [IDM](../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.md) or serve media through an interface. Anyone must be able to publish & broadcast through Headjack using their identity - [moderation & censorship](../implementation/ecosystem/moderation.md) will happen at the interface level.
