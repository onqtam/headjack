# Competition

This chapter focuses only on the [disadvantages](others_cons.md) of some of the more [high-profile competing solutions](others_list.md) in the space when compared to Headjack and doesn't list any of their positives as it would be too long (so not exhaustive by any means) but many of them have served as an inspiration for Headjack in one way or another - it wouldn't have been possible without them. Corrections for any inaccuracies are welcome!

1. [What others get wrong](others_cons.md)
2. [What Headjack gets right](headjack_pros.md)
3. [Concrete projects (list)](others_list.md)
4. [Shortcomings of Headjack](headjack_cons.md)
