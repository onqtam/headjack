# The ambition

Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs & micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and [making it sovereign](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441) - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces & views that present & filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.

[IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System), [Filecoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filecoin), [Sia](https://sia.tech/) & [Arweave](https://arwiki.wiki/) are the drivers, Headjack is the filesystem, and the collection of media & services built on top will be the global OS. Moving to a data-centric model where everything is addressable under a common global namespace would force applications to be [interoperable](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/) - unlocking unbounded [composability](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703067213066244).

Headjack [definitively](https://boxkitemachine.net/posts/zero-to-one-peter-thiel-definite-vs-indefinite-thinking/) aims to be the backbone of the entire public web - the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088) where all content is [cryptographically anchored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamper-evident_technology) and totally ordered. The confluence of stable addressing & indexing of information with identity, names and the interest graph results in a winner-take-all network effect with unprecedented gravity that can organize the world's data - [`@naval: "The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything"`](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3527). It can succeed in completely decentralizing [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) and disaggregating traditional platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, YouTube & Instagram through unbundling, reconstruction & interoperability on top of Headjack's building blocks by mix and matching various presentation layers, architectures, business models, content moderation policies, etc. [`"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."`](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20103-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts)

Headjack is the [15th and final](https://xkcd.com/927/) standard for decentralized identity and media.
