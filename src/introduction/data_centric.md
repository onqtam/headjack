# The data-centric ledger of record



The three components that enable self-authentication are [cryptographic identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), [content-addressed data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage), and [verifiable computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing).

THE LEDGER OF RECORD

analogous to the mental plane of the [Akashic records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records)

THE GLOBAL GIT

The ledger of record is the opposite of a [Sand Mandala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala).

DNS was the original “decentralization” (although not in the crypto sense)

    DNS was the original “decentralization”.
    RSS was an attempt for the next iteration
    How do you store your friend list?
    But rss is too technical
    Dns got overloaded too many times




- host/app-centric vs data/name centric
    host/app-centric addressing needs to go away.

    The web should move away from the host (ip/domain) and application-specific model towards data-centric

    NDN lacks a global name registry

    - deduplication





Data needs to be removed from the grip of host/app-centric monopolies

data-centric architectures are a paradigm shift

Persistent URLs, deduplicating content & anchoring everything to a single backbone greatly improves the indexability of the web.

the addition of a global singleton of access control management and key registry solves a lot of problems in NDN around security

Headjack is the index for web-scale [content centric networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_centric_networking).

A global index of all content throughout time in an Information-centric network - a form of named data networking layered on top of the current host-centric model (client-server connections through IP & DNS)

Differences from NDN: builds on the current internet infrastructure, doesn't have the same packet types and routing concepts - utilizes technologies that are currently available.

linking data is easier under a common global namespace

linking data based on URIs in a host-centric internet architecture is inherently flawed - needs to be in a named data paradigm

Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the end-to-end principle, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information (or content or data).

The core of ADX is self-authenticating data. In law, a “self-authenticating” document requires no extrinsic evidence of authenticity. In computer science, an “authenticated data structure” can have its operations independently verified. When resources in a network can attest to their own authenticity, then that data is inherently live – that is, canonical and transactable – no matter where it is located. This is a departure from the connection-centric model of the Web, where information is host-certified and therefore becomes dead when it is no longer hosted by its original service. Self-authenticating data moves authority to the user and therefore preserves the liveness of data across every hosting service.
