# Numbers


Everyone claims to be scalable - but here we'll prove that Headjack can handle billions of accounts and unlimited amounts of terabytes per second of off-chain content with simple napkin math





- numbers page in the introduction - how much can fit in 1 MB/s

a tiny core on which we have consensus can be used to cryptographically anchor & link unlimited amounts of data - the entire web - a few terabytes (tiny is relative - compared to the data) of materialized blockchain state including the absolute bare minimum of historic.



The processing of the state machine is minimal - orders of magnitude less complexity & compute compared to generalized smart contract platforms

There isn't a more minimal design that can link unbounded amounts of data to billions of identities that can change keys & names and yet still provide the guarantees & mental model simplicity of Headjack.
