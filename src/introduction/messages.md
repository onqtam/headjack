# Messages

<!-- TODO: take stuff form the other messages.md doc

signal/noise ratio - message types & why we shouldn't wait for AI classification

- fallback/default presentation/rendering - how to display content if an interface doesn't support a new activity type

tag type: disprove/correct - to combat misinformation & help crowdsource truth?



Why Headjack won't fall victim to stagnation and being stuck in time with this open standard and sort-of federation
https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/
- because messages will have default renderability
- because you'll always be able to click on items that your interface cannot display properly and go to the interface that produced them and see them properly

message type/format: price predictions with percentage possibilities, so that later reputations can be plotted based on the message type

tag type idea: prediction, and later with oracles credibility & track records could be automated
