We need to culturally redefine the fitness landscape - conscious cultural niche construction through collective participation and sensemaking



Cultural evolution is the continuation of biological evolution

democracy is like an economic market where you can only buy your products once every few years and many different aspects are clumped into representatives from only a few suppliers (2 in the US). If economic markets worked like that they wouldn't be creative or efficient

vertical markets are a disaggregation of democracy - enabling evolvability of governance solutions through fine-grained competition and trial & error

If a vertical market exists, an externality is like an unmet personal need in an economic market - a profit opportunity for any enterpreneur who wants to develop an element of governance that corrects that externality in a cooperative fashion


when you open a youtube video that you've watched previously and reset your view progress - wouldn't it be cool to know if you've seen it before?


consequence capture all the way down
consequence capture is what is applied recursively through all of the levels of complexification, cooperation and emergence.


we are about to hatch the global superorganism - fossil fuels have been our yolk and our current economic system is the scaffolding required to complexify to the next level of emergence

We’ve already had one enlightenment and the second is overdue.

According to John Stewart mercantilism was the main driver behind the Enlightenment.
It incentivized the development of rational cognition

According to John Stewart we need an escalator to meta-systemic cognition - to have a path for anyone to raise their awareness and understanding of our place in the developmental process and the forces within it
A cultural enlightenment


> "Consequence capture - so basically what governance does is reflect back onto the individuals of the collective the consequences of their actions on the collective as a whole. If an individual within a collective - a cell in your body for example - does something to harm your body, then the governance will reflect that back on the individual cell and harm the cell. Similarly for anything beneficial." - [John Stewart](https://youtu.be/XFqjbuYczc8?t=2198)



Complex scores - for the cases where claims cannot be calculated we can simply rely on the voting of a selected group of people

Competing crowdsourced ESG scores

PageRank is the wisdom of crowds
PageRank is a republic - not a perfect democracy. (Todo: what is a republic) - pages have different influence on other pages

When you browse someone’s lists you’re basically in a one-way conversation with them - “what do you value most, what do you recommend most, etc”

Working transparently and accountably deserves status. The highest accountability level deserves status.

PageRank for accountable and competent individuals is the human alignment problem

Google - relevance realization in the kitchen - sweet stuff is hidden in boxes by default. Why cant we design shops like that? As a “shop” template?

We can shape and define the psychology of the global brain

What if we asked the entire world every possible question uniquely and could filter out the results?

Our primary objective as a species should be recursive relevance realisation and making a market for objective truth and figure out how to collectively choose 

We must make being able to understand that viewpoint the default state of our civilization

Cooperation worship

It is our responsibility to erect an elite that deserves it

Capitalism is blind

Philip morris Indonesia kids

If its good enough for nature, it is good enough for us. We are part of nature.

Our goal should be to come up with the best and most important education for every human and then figure out how to diffuse the gradient between the least and best educated people. Nature is intolerant of gradients (temperature, pressure, electrical charge) and neither should our culture when it comes to education. We should strive towards educational equilibrium - even though it is inherently unattainable.



This is the way to participate in the building of our civilization






Politics should be replaced by simply putting the right person at the right spot - incentivising expertise and accountability - alining incentives

Mindlink

Everything is connected - what if we mapped it all out?

What if we could collectively agree on offchvain cbdc protocols and could collectively vote what should happen to them?

We can crowdsource and agree upon what the most fundamental concept of our civilisation should be, and why, and enforce it within there
Cooperation and education and the scientific method

Just like the CCP crafts policy papers which are then handed down to executive branches, we should crowdsource our civilisational policies and reward companies that implement them with higher ranking

We can crowdsource how the world should work and walk backwards from that until it becomes applicable to us currently

The meaning economy - how power, attention and incentives work in the global brain

Civilizational KPIs

Planning ahead for a debt jubilee

Anything that needs improvement in this new information economy will be collectively incentivised through reputation and pagerank

Da pisha na mariela za jivota i i za tezi dve knigi i kakvo bi mogla da napravi s izkustvo parichno i kato legacy

We should orient our lives towards building reputation that can be taken away from us by collective consensus - aligning our incentives.


PageRank 2.0

We can design the incentive system for participating in constructing the worldview that should be taught to everyone

Not living your best self is hurting the whole

We can sort the expertise of any vertical and then use the best

We need to crowdsource a new manager (as from john’s work) for the next step of our civilisation

Imagine the multidimentional oscars where any overlapping subset of people can vote differently - and all that in public. What different cohorts think, and what the cohort with the highest predictive capacity and competence and achievement ranks highest.


What if it becomes a competitive advantage for companies to allow their employees to export and prove their competence from their work there? Opening the gates for those that want to work in public and transparently


This is the real neuralink - the real way we link our minds

We should crowdsource the best possible guide to being a human

Reinventing governance

Cooperation is the ultimate intentionally evolutional goal

Write about wealth distribution and accumulation and how we should think about it

We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point
^^ this should be in the roadmap as a strategy

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

!!!! The great reset: !!!!
We should incentivise participating transparently in public and make that the only way of climbing the social ladder - a complete flattening of the power distribution - this is the great reset

The current elites would have to start earning reputation from ground up on the new rules

Hierarchy is a core tenet in computer science

Headjack offers a few distinct data availability setups - fully decentralized or proxy-mediated

the god of the 21st century has to be cooperation, backed by the scientific method and evolutionary theory


we use symbols and categories in our minds and there's a single representation for any concept/entity/event - we should do the same for the global brain

hyperindividualism will be our doom

we need a holistic view of the inerconnectedness of our civilization

The blank slate participatory redesign of our civilization

at the core of intelligence is the capacity for relevance realization - according to john vervaeke
relevance realization is self-organizing

the better we causally map reality, the better we'd navigate and realize what is relevant

Debasing the substrate upon which we depend

Our technical capability is growing exponentially while our capacity to make sense of the exponentially increasing complexity of the world is diminishing - this runs off a cliff
our information ecology is increasingly more broken
https://youtu.be/nQRzxEobWco?t=247


We need to let ideas have sex as Matt Ridley put it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLHh9E5ilZ4

imagine being able to subscribe to better metaphors for concepts you care about - metaphors that better get those ideas across to others. "Let me know when a more effective way of communicating this idea comes up"

we should be thinking in terms of sensory & motor systems - OODA loop

rewarding whistleblowing

the absence of reciprocity shouldn't pay - free riding should be abolished

In biology, within an organism, different organs or cells don't try to hide information from others - there is absolute transparency - even if signals don't traverse from end to end (most of the times it doesn't make sense)

A parallel reputational sensemaking network

Participatory social engineering

we could give points for "filling your profile" - values, top 10s, etc.


Balaji:
This, again, is quite different from current “social” networks like Twitter, which give individual scores for likes and followers but no team dashboard, no way of setting and achieving tangible goals as a group.

we need a power structure that is inherently trusted and legitimized by competency, accountability, transparency, and participation.

Global Brain Specialists are the future of consulting.

According to an ideal internet bill of rights, today's social media giants would be in violation as we can't freely associate and assemble - we don't truly own our data and there's no such thing as permissionless innovation.

Eventually, the network will become more powerful than both god and state.

augmenting markets, economics & finance with reputation and status

booting up the reputation/accountability/status market

Identity is something stable others can point to

extending capitalism to social capital

We are all complicit in ignorance

Inversion of control

Coherence funnel == concept/entity/event deduplication

We need to rethink most foundations of our civilization

concern: permanent record

Gamifying information processing

We can define the fitness landscape

Ignorance is an externality

We can incentivize specific affiliation and accreditation - nudging human resources


Mention the carbon pulse

Insight and progress happen at the edge of chaos - where we operate with concrete structure and ideas but inject randomness and allow for new kinds of pattern matching and mix and matching

All this is about the god paragraph

This is the social protocol
Cooperation, transparency, immutability
God

This is what self actualization is

This is the god that defeats moloch

To be in service of/to others

There >>>IS<<< an objective reality about any of our problems and we need to strive to get closer to it in our models of understanding

John Vervake’s legacy will be the contribution of relevance realization as a mental frame

We can gamify alignment

We can literally find ourselves in the situation of the movie dont look up

We can have a means to accurately assess the quality of the leaders we choose

Blockchain is the alignment technology that supersedes the old paradigm of nation states and markets with their current flaws 

“Use it or lose it” - we haven't even had a global brain to begin with (the closest we have is markets but they're unconscious) - imagine what we could achieve as a civilization

This idea is worth worshiping tm

Virtue’s most literal manifestation is cooperation

The alignment problem is 99% about human alignment

This project is how we build god and become him

The network is more powerful than the state

The full historical record of our work on the tree-like branching relevance realization requires immutable addressibility and permissionless access by anyone - at scale (no limits)

We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?

To be a philosopher is partially to work on relevance realization, just like fundamental physics, or biology

John Vervaeke will be remembered for elevating relevance realization as a fundamental concept or goal

This architecture enables the construction of the global consciousness - the global spotlight of most deserving attention - the global workspace theory - the global model of awareness

Taming human nature collectively

Write about the evolutionary adaptability of religions
“Turn the other cheek” - this is an attempt to tame human nature, to reduce conflict and to be moral to others.

Ego death is when you look at the world without the distortion of your own ego and seeing all the love - that is when you’re close to god - the desire to cooperate with everyone

Ego death is the transcendence above our nature - the leap towards the unification and alignment of the smartest and most conscious creature on earth

What if we could harness the will to power in the attempt of becoming god by 
"harnessing the will to power"

What if we could incentivize ambition the right way?
Aligning ambition within humanity

The purpose of life is relevance realization
The purpose of art is to point the way

What if we could choose cooperation as our god? And implemented incentives around identity such that the better and more you cooperate with others and contribute to society, the higher your status gets - closer to becoming god himsef?

What if god is the striving towards relevance realization in evolutionary terms?

What if the answer is relevance realization?

Give a list about what our civilization ought to do next - even immediately - to the best of your ability to forecast

We can vote our own version of the WEF - the one where we decide what to value

Labelers… adjudication

We need to strive for the most optimal relevance realization
Picture the god machine and how the root has the most impact in where the whip goes

Division of labor for the moderation and proper tagging with an incentive reputation for the exchange of time

We need to give the best possible education to everyone in the world - especially the disadvantaged

We need to change how we give status

We can make contributing a status thing

We can have a vote on how to rank votes for any type of other voting - effectively how do we give different kinds of status and how much do we value it

We can vote on the type of cbdc we would want

This is the booting of a network state where status is computable over track record and accountability and competence

The first and forever biggest network state that engulfs the rest will be the meta global governance layer based on transparency, accountability and competence

This is the idea market

Relevance realization is the square root of the meaning of life

The concern with global government is that it could cement the status quo of broken incentives

42 is relevance realization

Why do threadboys exist?

What comes after the state?

For some people the state is their god - how would the global government that younwould vote for be architected? This is the question we could collectively answer and reach alignment of humanity

The people dont want the current power structures to be cemented and because of the fear of the slippery slope to tyranny we reject globalisation

AGI is recursive relevance realization that has fully aligned everyone
The AGI moment is when we start cooperating

Think about what instagram, facebook and threads are.

We need a market for transparency and accountability. On the record

















how do we optimize society?
how do we make sure capital and human labor is allocated better?

Feed the same thing multiple times for greater weight - AI alignment

A voluntary information modulation network

A prerequisite for all of us to be on the same page and achieve coherence is to deduplicate all pages - i.e. concepts, entities, and events.
We need to answer every question just once and in the best possible way - so that we can easily point to it anytime it comes up. Coherence.

What if we could tag the response of someone as open-minded and willing to change their mind when confronted with facts - aka genuinely seeking truth? We need to reward good faith communication

The evolutionary octagon
An opt-in panopticon

we need to augment capitalism with values and accountability

The fairness protocol as god
The god protocol is about fairness and consent

We are incapable of collectively paying attention to what matters - who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience?


Why no structured data and instead all text in Social media 1.0? Because we always port what is familiar to new mediums - like newspapers in the early days of the web.

Concern: reflexivity: using reputation to influence outcomes and gain further reputation due to “proper” prediction

Currently, Wikipedia contributors get no status for their work beyond within their in-group - no wonder that so many people were skeptical it would ever work in the beginning. But what if they could earn computable and provable status that could be exported outside?

scaling labeling through progressive hierarchical escalation & fixing incentives

status for page rank could have decay


What if having worked for a company that got penalized also penalized your reputation - tainting?

Starting with banning pizzerias to burn coal is the most retarded thing we could be doing compared to a carbon tax or fixing our values and status as a society.

We need to direct our efforts towards the real economy - we could anonymously vote for what we want

So many people have critiqued utilitarianism but when I go to the criticism section of Wikipedia’s page for it ai see a tiny amount - not interwoven with identity and queryable.

Imagine being able to run any kind of poll for the people in the shared group - with different privacy settings - different types of voting for within groups and even worldwide polls

what if we could penalize someone for re-uploading a clip instead of linking to the part of the original without losing the context?

Recursive relevance realization
For everything

It is fundamentally an education crisis

Why don’t we derive everything from “most people are good?”

We are constantly amplifying the wrong things - how can we point to the important stuff?

The better we map out the economy, the better we’d be able to run provable simulations - digital twins of the economy

What if you got points for passing different tests for competence and training

What if we could give an account boost for anyone with a job? And so people who choose not to work currently might decide to work a bit for more status - boosting their overall number/score?
What if we gave more status to billionaires if they donated 10% (or 20?) of their wealth?
TODO: how could this backfire? they could essentially buy attentional influence with their money and make more money... Perhaps reputation should decay?
Capitalism leads to wealth concentration, (inflationary fiat money does too) but is the best form of aligning incentives and promoting risk-taking and hard work.
We can augment it (+ markets) by redefining status and incentivizing generosity.
Donations shouldn't be compelled and shouldn't simply go to the ever-hungry and unaccountable/inefficient/corrupt Uncle Sam in the form of a tax ("tax the rich!!! pay your fair share!!!") - anyone should be free to direct their donation however they choose.
Owning an excessive/lavish 250M$ penthouse might subtract some of your reputation

we can even give more weight to recent successful predictions and discount the earliest ones - when someone was still learning to think probabilistically and knew little about the world

Join the opt-in cooperative synapse society of the global brain - it comes with perks!

what if the fabric of society was defined by a layered web of reputation models - an ever-evolving complex incentive structure derived from our values?

What if we could reward the switching of beliefs in such a way as to incentivize early adopters of better ideas?

What if we could allow the greatest minds, scientists & game theorists to compete and engineer the best models for ranking humans based on their public contributions? Rewarding competency, predictive power, and adaptability (changing their minds when they're initially wrong). This can be the greatest game of all time - scoring high in the ever-evolving global ranking - where even anonymous accounts can participate. Enders game?

We can crowdsource the best legend of "how to participate and what you need to know in order to be good - statistical/bayesian thinking, etc." by checking what the highest-ranking members have suggested - like the "subreddit rules" that moderators define.

Subatomic particles came together to form atoms, which came together to form molecules, which formed cells, which formed complex organisms, which formed societies, and human civilization now seems to be forming what has been described as a “global brain.” Could this global brain of humans informationally connected by wireless devices someday become conscious? We can only speculate about what kind of emergences are in store for our civilization should we collectively choose to consciously participate in the process of cosmic evolution that life seems to be such a crucial part of.

By “cosmic significance,” I mean that life is a mechanism for the growth of complexity in nature that will shape the evolutionary trajectory of the universe and determine its large-scale development. And if biologically-based intelligence is the primary driver of cosmic evolution, then life has objective significance and a somewhat mysterious purpose that transcends the individual.

One could argue that it is a more profound paradigm shift than those associated with Newton and Darwin, because it places life at the center of everything, though It is actually an extension of the Darwinian paradigm, as it applies evolutionary logic to every scale of organization in nature, including the cosmos as a single system.

The fundamental issue of attention

imagine crowdsourcing a movie about the future we want based on our current collective values - as a snapshot in time, and redoing it once every 5 years as things progress

The ability to pattern-match any type of event

How do we make the important actually important, even if it is boring

We can have templates for concepts - how to represent them - what types of functionality layout we should want about a specific thing from the real world - what lens to use when regarding a specific type of concept/event
POSITIONAL SCARCITY !!!
crowdsourced relevance realization !!!

Make accountability liquid

the Aadhaar system in India is serving as the narrow waist of their national digital transformation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar
https://tigerfeathers.substack.com/p/the-internet-country

If we measure everything we could simply see the best predictor for any endeavor

We can literally crowd-source how we want things to be

What if we could derive everything from “be good to others”?

“Be good to others” is the r basis for any religion in regards to morals for within the tribe - we can crowdsource the transparency machine for any organization

“This is what is most important for X” - but for anything

The purpose of life is to leave something after yourself and contribute - to be of service to others

A competence market

We can crowdsource our culture - this is the collectively chosen weights

How do we solve humanity’s biggest problem: how to coordinate better in order to have the best possible future


The metaverse is an mmorpg knowledge graph

futarchy - high dimensional?

we need to change our concept of prestige

How do we ender’s game the global brain and gamify it so participating is interesting?

computable identity: how many times have you shared a news story that contains deepfakes (determined later)?

social learning in regards to the complexity of ontologies and working with knowledge graphs and structured data - since it's all one big social network we'd see how others are using the tools and creating structured data - effectively teaching us how to better express ourselves

The metaverse is the augmentation of the physical with the digital

how to counteract discounting

"synthesis" as project name

better social technologies lower social coordination costs and reduce friction

what if you could define a notification filter for messages/connection requests/etc - anyone with above 10k followers for example

multi-pagerank
poly/multi

social media posts are ephemeral - they're irrelevant beyond the first couple of days (get burried with time) - they're promoted by the recommendation algorithms only for a a small amount of time as there's a constant stream of new events

hit pieces use points selectively (and its hard to gague them of truthfullness) whereas a model calculating a reputation score would take everything into account

radical interconnectedness - glancing at a blog post and being able to see which sections were quoted elsewhere, and being able to filter the "elsewhere" any way you want

generalized scripting!
instead of apps offering niche functionalities you could script and do anything with data!
https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1666102355698364416

The informational multiverse

the next step of encephalization is truly networking our minds - deduplicated identities, concepts & events

we need to upgrade our capacity to learn

A truth market for ideas

Relevance realization: given the near-infinite complexity of the world, how do we intelligibly ignore irrelevant information and zero in on that which is relevant to us?

think of this as collectively writing the guide to/book of life

We need to shift from what are we against to what are we for

It will simply be better and people would shift to it as word goes around

what if we submitted algorithms long a few lines that express more complex things? the collective notebook with interactive code trying to prove stuff?

we could all collectively have a conversation through the distributed aggregate computing of all individuals


TODO: relisten to this episode
Currents 034: Samo Burja on the Consilience Project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHCg8bhtbqs
talks about carbon credits, media, many good things and ideas I've had

If there are no consequences for wall street playing the “short and distort” game with Tesla for a decade (including the hardest of times for them) - then we should be able to de-amplify topics and entities too. Todo: this point needs more thought

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

what if you want to be able to message someone (they're a contact) but you don't want to follow them on instagram because you're simply not interested in reels and them ending up in your feed and you also don't have a DM channel open with them? its engineered for engagement

we could even split our own vote like 30% from me and the rest 70% split between my delegates for this cause

We need an additional informational signal that is as robust as prices driven by markets and currently media is a failure

write about mycelium

TODO: think about labeling of naughty material and the streisand effect

what if the tags for a creator are automatically updated based on the tags for their individual posts and also ranked by occurance with a histogram?

"Don't look up" but in real life
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/

This is the clearest manifestation of democracy and classical liberalism
careful with the word liberalism - it might not be the right thing here

structured data == AST, where language is the current intermediate representation (IR) and we can upgrade it to structured data
IR built on top of deduplicated concepts, entities and events

“The religion that is not a religion” - stolen from John
Wisdom and meaning famine

evolution is a kind of learning - we need to foster gradual evolvability in every direction
Autodidactic !!!

what if we could short topics? like putting our thumbs on the scales - "show less culture war stuff and surface more important issues"

minimizing ignorance - we need to minimize the error in our models of reality

"complex adaptive systems (CAS) all the way down"

what if we could have citation graphs and ranking for anyone on any topic - not just within the scientific realm?

embracing complexity

anonymity - ZK stuff and dating apps! DATING APPS!

Imagine having your personal jamie to pull things up

fractal debate map

Money on money return

situational awareness - what's the relevant context - being able to view the same thing from different lenses

being wrong should have a cost

We can have competing opt-in committees of experts for health advice

meaning in life comes from connectedness, and especially being connected to something bigger than ourselves

We can crowdsource what is most important and even rank and sort the steps to get to there!!!

complete freedom to experiment in network protocols and self-assembly / self-organization

What if we could develop an opt-in social credit score that we individually determine how it gets calculated? A subjective score

a new choice-making architecture

No Recursively asking “how do we get there? What are the next steps?”

“The recursive subreddit” as a buillding block - a concept

Use a picture of a cockpit with thousands of buttons when talking about social media configurability and the config matrix

A new era of social computing
“Social computing”

We are effectively unconscious

Egalitarianism, meritocracy and a market for ideas

The ultimate currency is time and thus also attention

Error correction scaled

Transparency, accountability, truth and sunlight

We can crowdsource “a guide to life”

We can have campaigns in which we advocate for our values against those of others - in groups, and showing the progress publicly, and how the vote evolves throughout time

Its all just one big high dimensional wikipedia - a multipedia

Write a chapter about a summary of vervaeke’s work and how heafjack as a project overlaps and aids in building the right social system

We can crowdsource what to teach our children - skills, values, technologies
And not just children - even adults. We can collectively guide our attention to what is most meaningful

A philosophical & scientific MMORPG

Meaning in the 21st century - become competent in something, be credible and have the ability to influence stuff - and increase the weight of your vote - a weight thats calculated by consensus

Meaning in the 21st century: aiming for a higher impact if your opinions - earning that weight and have the ability for it to decrease at any point if you do wrong things.
“The reward function” as a chapter

TODO: use high dimensional instead of multi? or not.

Adding dimensionality to thoughts - the ability to filter opinion any way you want

The ability to vote on how votes should be counted in compound model representations

with liquid democracy each person could be a high dimensional representation of their own views

what if we sankey-diagramed every aspect and product of society - from carbon footprint to what transitive connections there are to low-ranking and sociopathic companies and even monetary influence

Negative reputation: carbon footprint, money influence, previous scandals

We can blur our egos together

Bringing liquidity to ideas
A market for any idea

We are unconscious as a species

Whistleblower friendly ecosystem

the most radical experiment in self-organization and emergent order to date

this can replace even phone numbers

instead of upvote/downvote - 5 star ratings on 2 measures: quality and importance

Music… flow… your attention

game b should parasitize game A
game b should be meta-stable

The law of attraction - and attention and focus and how we need to view our attention

Consciousness is about directing computational resources - our predictive capacity

We are not a cosmic accident; we are a cosmic imperative. The universe is self-organizing and self-actualizing, but it cannot achieve such aims on its own. Curiously, it needs the help of humble mortals. This gives humanity a collective purpose: to assist the universe in its great awakening by ensuring that life persists. To see to it that this process is realized, we must overcome existential challenges by aligning our interests, which promotes cooperation and minimizes conflict. The new cosmic narrative creates an ethical, economic, and political philosophy that has the power to unify us in these divided times.

We must recognize that we are part of an interdependent, interconnected whole, and we must make decisions that are consistent with the goals of civilization.

> "There are various ways of interpreting Current Things.
>
> A charitable view is that it’s the wisdom of crowds surfacing the most important problems as well as the best ways of solving those problems. 
>
> A less charitable view is that Current Things are “continuous overlapping sequence of emergencies, awakenings and panics, driven by the same interlocking power centers, demanding ever tighter censorship of speech and thought.”
>
> An even less charitable view is that Current Things, paraphrasing Balaji, are the social equivalents of pump and dumps: They are pump and dumps for clicks for the journalists, votes for the politicians, and dollars for the activists. After all, the business model of the press & social media might as well be to cause the reader as much outrage as possible, every day, to cause fear and panic and drive them to come back tomorrow.
>
> These are all interesting observations — that Current Things involve everyone converging onto the same beliefs and that there are profit motives for increasingly surfacing New Current Things — but they undersell the truthiness of The Current Thing.
>
> Current Things always have elements of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t capture the world’s imagination. If they didn’t contain at least some kernels of truth, they wouldn't resonate. 
>
> That said, there is also often something “off” about The Current Thing as well. If it were so obviously, incontrovertibly accurate, it wouldn’t go viral, since everyone would be convinced already. There’s no need for evangelism when everyone is already converted. What goes viral is often what creates controversy between groups, where people retweet & quote tweet as a way to claim what side they’re on. If they don’t speak up, their tribal loyalty is questioned. Hence the phrase “silence is violence”.
>
> Additionally, for a moral incident to go viral — for it to be The Current Thing — it has to be super clear-cut. And real-life events usually aren’t that clear-cut.

> "Jonathan Haidt, in his book “[The Righteous Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind)” explained the purpose of Current Things when he wrote “Morality binds and blinds.” Current Things bind people together over common beliefs, and they blind people to independent thought outside of the collective, since independent thought can at times be an impediment to group identity. More specifically regarding blindness, people become unwilling to critically analyze the Current Thing if it goes against the belief, precisely because that analysis is a threat to the coherence of the group. When this happens at the group level, this becomes The Madness of Crowds, as opposed to The Wisdom of Crowds, which we usually get when everyone is thinking as a rational individual, not when they are delegating their opinions to the zeitgeist.

> "As Martin Gurri chronicled in The Revolt of The Public, after social media suddenly global conversation became two-way instead of one-way. This was a radical shift. If you were living in 1965 and you thought that something was weird with the JFK assassination in 1965, what were you going to do, call somebody and complain? Write a letter to the editor? Good luck getting any attention on that — even if millions of people agreed with you. Whereas today you can instantly spin up a sub-reddit or facebook group or make something go viral on Twitter if it resonates widely. The internet enabled people to research the details of any conspiracy, and share their findings with other people also obsessed with the same experience." - [The Current Thing, Part 2 - Conspiracy theories as Bizarro Current Things, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-2#:~:text=As%20Martin%20Gurri,the%20same%20experience.)

Whereas people who want to be left alone are by definition no good at recruiting or defending their tribe. If you disagree with The Current Thing or The Bizarro Current Thing and you try to convince both sides to moderate, you will have no home and you will get accused of treason by both sides.

> "Marc Andreessen recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1513720791988330498): is the internet an engine or camera?…Are things actually more stupid today, or were they always stupid and we’re just more aware of the stupidity now?
>
> Of course, Communism and Nazism predated the internet, and those movements were crazier than anything we’re seeing today. People have been taking political sides and forming up mobs and killing scapegoats since….forever.
>
> It seems obvious that the internet is both: It’s a camera that becomes an engine. People act differently in front of the camera—they perform for their tribe, especially when people’s tribal loyalty is in question, as it always is in a society where our tribal bonds are formed over beliefs instead of genetics or geography. And the internet offers the widest camera angle possible—everyone is in the frame 24/7, always at risk of being called out.
>
> And this is why we don’t prioritize rational conversation: We care more about being part of the tribe. Everything makes much more sense when we understand that people are hard-wired to choose a tribe, stick within it, and defend it unconditionally." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=Marc%20Andreessen%20recently,defend%20it%20unconditionally.)

> "Here’s the kicker: the crazier a bonding ideology is—the further away it is from objective reality—the more powerful it is in forming tribes. Why? The crazier the idea, or the crazier the way a person defends their idea, the more it proves their loyalty to the group by shutting off their other available options. Your perceived loyalty increases when you make yourself unsuitable for other tribes because it proves you won’t defect and join them. Until you do that, all tribal attachments are fleeting and contingent.
>
> Consider the phrase, “Abolish the police”, a Current Thing in 2020. Even the people who claimed “Abolish the police” concede that’s not what they truly meant. They meant redirecting police funds to social services and reforming police accountability. But the phrase “Abolish the police” achieves the goal of improving their reputation within their tribe because, by abandoning reasonableness, they are burning the boats to the enemy tribe, demonstrating their in-group loyalty. 
>
> This is also why Abolish the Police was such a textbook Current Thing. “Increased social services for poor people” would have never taken off, nor would “Reform police unions”. People have been trying to get attention to those topics for decades. Only something crazy, but with a kernel of truth, could get such wide attention.
>
> To reiterate: The Current Thing is sometimes true, but it certainly isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit.

The Personal Responsibility Vortex: Bret Weinstein at TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjNRtrZjkfE
Bret's point is that there is a positive feedback loop between lobbying and making more money due to lobbying which affords more lobbying - aka regulatory capture. We need to engineer a negative feedback force that is adequate enough to constrain such unstable and self-terminating feedback loops.
This unconstrained feedback loop is perhaps the biggest contributor to wealth and power concentration.
Furthermore, people and corporations that do the right thing often disadvantage themselves (often in the form of having less money) which leaves them with less power which leads to further disadvantage - Bret calls that the "Personal Responsibility Vortex".
This personal responsibility should be directed towards collective action aimed at restructuring the incentives that surround the market and chanring the malignant behavior.
All costs and negative externalities (polution & environmental damage, even debt for future generations) need to be accounted for.
All manufactured demand needs to be called out.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for adaptive evolution are: 1) reproduction, 2) variation, 3) heritibility, 4) differential success.
What if we could engineer an informational environment where truth and error correction is the dominant strategy through the right incentives and mechanisms for collective action?
Reputation, structured data that anyone can analyze, and deduplicating concepts, entities & events are a big part of that.
We can engineer our fitness landscape.

the inability for anyone to programatically process public data flexibly and reliably in any way imaginable limits our capacity for collective self-introspection and error correction. The host-centric model must go.

In retrospect we will wonder how we could be contempt with what social media was in the first few decades of this century

Light is the best disinfectant

Amplification choice and transparency

Unique notification signatures (sounds, vibrations, icons, colors) help us disambiguate between sources and we can have less need to instantly check where the notification came from
Ambiguity sets off a mental process of us wandering “What was that?” - hiding the punchline, stimulating arousal, and leading to distraction

inconsequential notifications ("someone liked your photo") don't need to be delivered immediately - they can be batched - instead of the current way

your public process of doing something for others gives you credibility how well you're doing and that gives weight to your vote on something.

post physique reddit - how about post food? how about we crowdsource marketing for what we truly love and drown out advertising from broadcast media?

memes encode semantic structure - the one with Anakin and ", right?" as a template always has the same structure. We are pattern matching slots of ideas and expressions visually - how further could we push the encoding of information for more efficient communication?

we are at the absolute other end of the spectrum of where we should be - having just 2 main political views and media being aligned with them. We need to shard our attention into a million pieces

the next iteration of the mechanism and experiment that is America will be global and digital

heck, why don't we vote on our own top movies list like the oscars


Prestige should be based on predictive ability - track record and skin in the game












what if we had views with different levels of granularity and detail for the whole picture? one set of humans are labelers - a task that is easily checkable and quite unambiguous, but the actual view of the world was produced by combining different labelers with different weights based on their reputation? Neural nets have many layers - feature recognition, etc.

# Exploring the Matrix

Toggling layers of the graph or whatever - monetary layer - how money and influence flow

we should be able to look up if person X has ever made a statement about X, and what they said - for example how do you currently query all the podcasts of Naval if he has ever said anything about Edward Snowden? How do you query that? You simply can't.

Artificial global intelligence is agi alignment

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

THIS IS AI ALIGNMENT - this is the alignment problem.
1. we must all have access to the data as easily and effortlessly as possible
2. we must use the crowdsourced competency and non-cancellation score when giving different weights of opinions.

Current AI is compression. Compression of sentiment

the way to alignment is towards increased transparency and accountability between us - we must create a cooperation environment to "train" (aka compress) the AI on

who watches the watchmen - who watches those that set the weights when training the models? what if the complete training could be separated into chunks as snapshots and we could occasionally pay extra to re-run the same part of the algorithm and compare results between expected and produced



imagine a media app and a set of algorithms and configuration options presented as a spreadsheet where for every cell someone is responsible, and the election for that cell is public and contains a debate map where we can filter the inputs of people based on the rules we determine are appropriate for us

== weights and parameters in algorithms
== crowdsourced algorithm weights & parameters & content modulation



we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

what if reputation had a computable value which you couldn't trade, but simply compute? No way to buy your way in - the only way being through a long enough track record?

Concern: no way to add friction when spreading information with sharing - how do you enforce that a link cannot be shared unless you’ve actually visited it? How do we combat the sharing of information based solely on the titles? Perhaps the signalling and labeling can come into play - ppl can show that a given app is not playing according to the good rules
Same about limiting the number of shares for a piece of content - perhaps up to 2 or 3 hops/levels
The further down a reshare chain (a reshare of a reshare of a reshare) - the more the distortion (razvalen gramofon)
If you want to share further beyond some limit you’d have to explicitly copy/paste it - this removes toxicity beyond a certain level

There should be no “magic/secret sauce” when it comes to recommendation algorithms. And we need to put the weights in the control of the users

We should think more carefully about the weights we give when ranking interactions
example: twitter's algorithm favors replies and gives a boost
what about CAD’s theorem of topic culture. A smart is less likely to receive a reply than a stupid post because it leaves less to be said, but a really full and comprehensive post will bring the conversation to a halt. 

Weights - should the reactions of someone who spends 8 hours a day online have the same weight as someone who reacts once a week or month? What if someone is producing 100 or 1000 times more content than the average account or more than the 99th percentile - should their ability to influence the ranking be the same as everybody else? Perhaps once you go beyond the activity of the 99th percentile you should start getting less and less impact for your actions for a rolling window
Compulsive social media users can (and do!) influence the algorithms for the rest of us
Something like the gini coefficient - capping and/or modulating the influence someone can have on the rest of us
Most people’s experience is asymmetrically influenced by “the compulsive few”
“The few, the proud, the compulsive”
Socially isolated people lean heavily on social media
Viral outbursts of anxiety


These are the types of questions and design decisions we’re simply not having and participating in because we’re outsiders for the social media platforms


What if there was a way to signal your preferred solution every time you comment on a problem? And what if we boosted responses that offer solutions/improvements? Inspired by solutions journalism

what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?

what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature

What if anyone could analyze the history of reactions of a post and see if there was an initial coordinated boost by some clique of connected accounts from a troll farm? Currrntly such analysis can be done only by insider data analysts

Identity can be computable





what if we could signal "back me up" for specific posts - leveraging our audience for select issues?

Feedback loop - you see what tags your audience expects and they see your content by tags if you’ve tagged it (or they could use AI to classify but that could be ambiguous)

We can show things in progress - suck as quitting smoking or participating in some challenge - justin.tv but with structured data

What if IDMs had to burn the native token when creating new accounts in a way similar to 1559? And what if this 1559 was not shared but per-idm? So that each IDM is throttled economically according to their own speed of growth?

There is no integration without extreme deduplication of data and identities

> "The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress—the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system’s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness). Defined in this way, “stress” turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term duḥkha (otherwise often rendered as “suffering”), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so duḥkha is a continuous state that compels beings to act. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of “make and maintain a whole limb” of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives. It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=The%20central%20treadmill,of%20other%20beings.)

> "Stress drives agents towards homeostatic goals—a concept central to Buddhism with its teaching of existence as dissatisfaction, duḥkha. Expanding one’s space of possible goals to face outwards, exhibiting compassion toward other agents’ goals, potentiates the increase of intelligence and thus the potential to identify better, more global solutions. In this scheme, compassion (in the sense of practical concern) and intelligence are tightly linked because the driving definition of an active agent is the bundle of processes that expend energy toward system-level goals. The scale and content of what a given agent measures, prefers, and seeks to implement define its cognitive sophistication." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=Stress%20drives%20agents,its%20cognitive%20sophistication.)

> "The evolution of brains is a story of increasingly coordinated collective behavior, driven by the emergence of more efficient forms of intercellular communication, increasing differentiation and specialization of cell types, increasing interdependence, and progressive refinement of organization. At each stage, the benefits achieved through cooperation must have outweighed the costs of increased competition for resources that comes with sharing territory. Thus, we view brains as one end of a continuum of collective behavior wherein the collective has become especially coordinated and complex in organization." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Neural structure is not hard-coded into the genes — indeed, there couldn’t possibly be enough information in the human genome to encode neural structure — but instead is robustly reproduced time and again through these competitive dynamics. Malfunction of these processes (i.e., overproduction of neurons or lack of pruning) is associated with a number of brain disorders. Along these lines, proponents of “Neural Darwinism” and related views suggest that brain development, and intelligence more generally, can be understood as analogous to the evolution of a species through variation and selection." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’" - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20theory%20begins,the%20%E2%80%98body%20schema.%E2%80%99)

Converging evidence from both psychology and neurophysiology suggests that the brain relies on a set of relatively robust, but ultimately limited, tricks in order to compute the configuration of the body. Though these tricks tend to work well under normal circumstances, laboratory scenarios can be devised that result in the dissociation of the body schema and the actual configuration of the body." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=the%20body%20schema%20appears,configuration%20of%20the%20body.)

For example, if you have any intuitive understanding of attention, of its dynamics and consequences for behavior, and if you are concerned about your diet, then you know not to stand all night next to the dessert tray at a party.

Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=awareness%20is%20part%20of%20the%20control%20mechanism,effect%20on%20behavior%20than%20it%20would%20otherwise.)

"individuals as neurons" chapter
the current host-centric world where platforms own our data and is siloed is preventing us as a giant global brain to wire any way we want


THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?








index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes




"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"




== The global connectome

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

we have maladaptive connections and lack (neuro)plasticity. The global brain lacks (neuro)plasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity



we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
inherit algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!




we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy








we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)























youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.













We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types - even if we have just watched a video like that?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?































https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory




== Computable context & SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs

what if we could see all the unique assertions a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that? What if we could analyze how their views changed throughout time?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts

what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?











shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"










we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability












Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations











deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

        - not incentivized

== ideas for apps:
- feed composer - from subscriptions - with pipes


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color




The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet




What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



unlocking the potential of the internet

Aiming to make politics downstream of science - not the other way around

Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.


apps that consume private indexes but done according to public rules and get them uniquely fingerprinted so that leaks are detected, those apps can stake a token in something escrow-like with an amount determined by market forces, and those that produce the indexes and give them with unique fingerprints could slash and/or confiscate their stake

can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model


2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership


Public actions should be regarded as public contributions



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"



global questions will have URIs that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"


NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing


make a mission section with a bunch of mission statements - that all come together in a whole


being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.


move from @handle to full names in citations in the book

So many ideas that can be implemented as a hackaton at any of the big social media companies are never even attempted - because it doesn’t serve their bottom line. Thats why the host-centric model must go

Logo/Cover photo idea: headjack which extends as a vortex/fractal of interconnectedness

== double addressing?
headjack://app_id/nonce/user_id/content_id
headjack2://user_id:concept_id


when we give a universal address to any item extensibility becomes trivial. Suppose you have a list of movies and you want to edit it in a way that's not allowed by the UI - what if you could write a script to fetch it, process it and re-upload the new version?


The 2 dirtiest words when it comes to the Twitter API: "rate limited" - read "innovation & insight limited"

we should disincentivize engagement farming

The google index for public data is private - it should be public infrastructure

fine-grained control
When viewing a post - have the ability to choose wether to respect the OP’s blocks and not see comments from blocked users or not


Economics is downstream of coordination


there isn't an ounce of fat to remove from this design - anything more minimalistic would complicate the mental model for working with the system.

!! NOT REALLY - identity


== clips
== improving audio & video

if someone uploads a clip someone can link it to the original content with timeline mapping so that one can view the original instead of the clip if they wish - similar to the "title change for less clickbait" stuff
"DISINCENTIVIZING DUPLICATION"
Todo: chapter about the movie maker - the timeline composer
clips are dysfunctional
clips are reuploaded because uploaders would get the revenue... this needs a solution

a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ... just kidding.

What happens to URIs with names that get used in a blob which doesnt get anchored immediately and name ownership changes before it gets anchored?
