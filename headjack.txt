the fastest way for pro social behaviors is to make sure everyone's reputation is on the line

apps should be able to show you all references to a document - perhaps they might show specific UIs for those that are supported and all others should be in the "other" list without visualization

PROVENANCE as a chapter?

competing wikipedia-like pages written by different people & being able to select between them? no more "trusted source" issues?

infrastructure - no need for a robots.txt file anymore - they were initially introduced because of [a badly-behaved web crawler that inadvertently caused a denial-of-service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt#:~:text=a%20badly%2Dbehaved%20web%20crawler%20that%20inadvertently%20caused%20a%20denial%2Dof%2Dservice%20attack)

EDIT: actually sitemaps are only partially outdated - what about pages that are not reachable at all? that's when sitemaps are also useful - to explicitly mention them



ability to specify criteria for the delegation - no need to pick specific people i. The liquid voting

There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes


competition page: batching & compactness (FC does have some fancy hub sync)

Structured data should be incentivized - we’re drowning in text audio and video

The role of something like change.org

add tiny designs/screenshots for the different ideas - like a multi-level tree for subscriptions and how you could be partially subscribed to someone

UIs should be drag/drop composable & layoutable - in the superapp

roadmap ==> secret master plan

your main job would be to be an annotator - such that you get scored based on performance

free the graph

can't be evil - restore from point

we need to enable freeform networking at scale in order to build a global brain - the host-centric model doesn't allow that - any type of data should be linkable & manipulatable with any other data type

for search engines to rank modern dynamic & single page apps they need to render them server-side - this can be skipped if data is decoupled from presentation and if the ranking engine is simply listening for document updates. They also currently cache the entire pages - just like an archival service. Massive benefits in a push vs a pull system for crawlers & indexers

what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...

the skill tree in linkedin is completely fake - we could crowdsource it or have reputation systems based on real events & attestations and allow for any visualization

we can have a leaderboard for every topic under the sun

business model: develop open source with a license for commercial use that requires payment - that's ok

we can use AI to generate podcast-like conversations that cover the digital interactions of structured data

currently we channel our energy in a useless way - the best we can do is get a hashtag trending. But with this system every type of interaction would count

using structured data circumvents the need to think about the right words - it reduces friction in expression - streamlined expression as a chapter?

think of the the superapp as a browser

Cant be evil - raising the bar for censorship - accountability and exit

Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication? DEFRAGMENTATION !!!

Move the decentralization point from the design page to the cant be evil page

Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header vould be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example

multidimensionality - think about what "friendship" is

growth hack: show some badge who invited you to the network (and how many people you have invited) - perhaps with some referral link initially?

list explicitly all the different aspects of an online presence - goodreads, medium, quora, stack exchange, reddit, twitter, etc.

farcaster is too opinionated

streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?

on-chain nouns with IDs so that no one person controls the set and DA is guaranteed? what if a quorum of validators/tokenholders is required for the approval of a noun set? what if only the keys of the nouns are on-chain, but for big values only the hash can be stored on-chain? but the key is still stable for joins?
Message types should be on-chain nouns

what if we enable communication through structured data and formal methods on top of it? What if we enable anyone to build any kind of sophisticated tool for formal modeling of the world around us?

Graph tool for constructing queries - data processing pipelines like in Foundry

TODO: add this in the attention & alarms & notifications section of the book - we should be able to take control - anyone should be able to build new frontends where we can set limits
What If You Quit Social Media For 30 Days?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u5p6hwS5SM

Anatomy of your digital footprint

even browser extensions should be counted as preferences - for example I use a youtube addon that hides the recommended videos on the side - I should be able to signal that if I wish

there should be something like twitter's community notes for any kind of media - not just tweets

Competitive superiority

what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?

high trust (social capital), shared stories & strong institutions - required for democracy, but social media is eroding them - Jonathan Haidt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu2jprZ50FY

Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid

google have failed with their mission - they have not organized the world's information - they have merely ranked it - organization is much broader

What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps woth these ids when revoking on behalf of users?

Think about making monetary settlements with zl proofs on topnof ethereum for polls

separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items

we should shift curation from explicit moderation by people to tagging & filtration preferences by the consumer

every account should have an AMA associated with them

"We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology." - Edward O. Wilson

media tells us what is salient but we lack the tools to question the framing

every change, every edit, every commit - all could be linked to your identity if you wished it

your profile page - a linktree-like thing

today's media is an attention hijacker - one that shows us what is salient to us, but not necessarily what's true

For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color

view profile relevant to the current app VS view full profile with all activity

anyone should be able to construct graph narratives by selecting "facts" which can be observed & pointed at

Join protocol

Adapters for current web2 platforma - wrap actions in messages thatnpoint to the web2 platform?

Example: github stars - what if anyone could develop filters for the stars of people with advanced criteria? Different trending dashboads?

Key rotation in competition - for lens perhaps account abstraction would help

We should be able to view the most pressing questions for public figurrs and CEOs
Integrating all these different use cases with social media and unified identity and notifications is how to make them viral
We should be able to surface questions to elites and leaders and make it glaringly obvious if they have responded to them or not
It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same identity & data network
Sporadic Reddit AMAs are absolutely ibadequate
This is what connecting people looks like - facebook isnt even scratching t he surface

we should strive to separate causal patterns from correlated patterns

Private opinions for polls - you might not want them public but still to be able to compare with those who are public

Farcaster: with or without CRDTs you should be processing everything anyway, and with a simple fork choice rule you wouldnt need crdts

Follow preferences of others - not hust as notifications but also automatically adopting them


Sociology and how anyone can do it - picture: mirror 

Milultidimentionality picture: sphere with spikes with different length and maybe labels

Algorithms could use this liquid interest network to amplify and prioritize certain people on the loud speaker - I bet daniel Schmat would rank quite high - something the youtube algo wouldnt do

identifier type in the table - integer or hash of public key - in competition table

== A self-organizing system - in the sensemaking chapter
we can achieve cycles of differentiation (random exploration) followed by convergence & integration to refine our collective model of reality in a self-organizing system - just like our minds work
complexification followed by iterative integration - assimilation & compression - calibration against the real world is the constant flux between the two
zooming in and zooming out
https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=3112
stark contrast - Compare that to what we currently have - attention-driven feedback loops of psychosis & epileptic seizures - we are unable to integrate the signal - we have no capacity to adaptively re-fit itself to the world
The internet is suffering from epilepsy
our current systems optimize for efficiency (attention capture) - not the evolvability of ideas
the host-centric model hinders our ability to develop the tools for integration - for interlinking & coming to consensus - we're given one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator functionality in the race to the bottom of the brain stem

we lack precision weighting of the signals ==> hence our psychosis

> "the function of consciousness is to do enhanced relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4094)

> "what consciousness is doing is higher-order relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4199)

our capacity to pay attention in the right way was evolved - it is fundamentally an adaptive ability - it was selected for

you should be allowed to pin a comment explaining your vote. And that comment should be able to evolve & change


just like we have a mental model when doing searches that we can request results only from the last month, the same way we'll learn to think in terms of filters & slices

so much expressed opinions & views are left unanalyzed & unaggregated because they're in text - they have an ephemeral impact for a moment and then fade

we can use something like ChatGTP to summarize the results of polls from different points of view and write the text for a topic and always keep it up to date. This is the decentralized wikipedia.


current twitter polls don't allow us to show our vote but we're free to express it in text publicly?

Many social networks have polls about preferences & beliefs - we've filled so much questionnaires but none of them have been truly meaningful

distributed cognition or sensemaking?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition

We can all do what sociologists do


Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Disallowing comments on a youtube video is just dumb because you cannot disallow comments for it on reddit anyway - all you are doing is trying to hide commentary about what you are presenting
Moonlandinh faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evodence

Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimagiinative

fragmentation....

we should be able to come to consensus about questions such as "how much cobalt goes into EVs, how much EVs are not using cobalt at all anymore, and where is cobalt coming from (hint: not just the congo)"

recommender algorithms incentivise clickbait. Explicit follow graphs incentivise quality & explicit recommendations by people you follow

ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world

what if your home page was like a desktop?

information theory very well could be as important as or even fundamental to matter & the laws of physics and they are tightly interwoven - we should keep that as a perspective - as to why we should strive to optimize it

we can crowdsource X and gamify it into success - it's been done before with initiatives like foldit @home

nature has removed every unnecessary bit when it comes to exchange of information - and so should we.

designing from first principles - what needs to be decentralized? what's the common use case for 99.9% of cases? what are the guarantees we should provide - and nothing less?

current platforms constrain our global neural network from freely wiring - we're allowed a very limited set of wiring


stable identity keys allows for stable concept/collection/noun keys which allows for stable mapping and deduplication of concepts

key stability ==> information deduplication & integration

recommender systems & search engines should NOT give you "other things you might be interested in" interleaved with the results for a specific query just to get you more engaged - but that's something YouTube is doing. You didn't ask for that but you got it




https://twitter.com/SocietyLibrary
the internet is unstructured
linked knowledge database
libraries & debate maps
libraries - concepts can be linked to different multimedia expressions - resources that describe it
debate maps are the onthological structure of the debate - aimed at deliberation

what if wikipedia-like "pages" were sitting on top of debate maps, highlighting an editorialized take and perhaps generated/summarized by an LLM? And what if people could choose the editorialization?

knowledge graph

this needs to be intertwined with social media, identity & follow graphs

giant global graph
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph
a massively multiplayer interlinked knowledge database

machine-understandable knowledge representations
subject-predicate-object triplets in the semantic web
these are just like subject-verb-object of the human natural language - there's an equivalence

being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign

sensemaking is about creating maps

redundant knowledge & broken chains of provenance








Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.








DIKW pyramid
data, information, knowledge, and wisdom
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid





signal/noise ratio - language is unbelievably complex and it compacts so much implied and assumed meaning and expressions of truth


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web
The great attention misallocation


just like in open source problems need to be solved only once, the same way in a world of unified identity & deduplicated concepts interwoven with social media debates need to be had only once


the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled & recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization
time well spent: user empowerment in being able to control what they want to see & how much of it

the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized & undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.

the 2 sides of "the consumer is always right":
- the brain stem one - whatever they engage the most with is the right thing
- the frontral cortex one - whatever they explicitly choose is the right thing



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic


"deconstructing your digital footprint"

"realigning incentives"

"the promise of decentralized identity & media"





By severing the connection between identity management and media we can better align the incentives of these systems - our IDMs would not be harvesting our attention and we could tune the addictiveness & notifications

is about expression with 0 integration - either personally or collectively for that expression - its an append-only brain dump. We need open structured data

interlinking enables discoverability - you'd want to reference something specific because then you could be discovered from the referenced thing with a "references" view

everyone can have access to something like Palantir Foundry for the entirety of the open web

we should be able to annotate parts of movies that we are crituiquing and be able to see all public critiques when viewing the original media

@mentions can also be stable! even if handle ownership changes

Headjack fixes this.

the decision maker: build trees of predicates and based on truth for each of them you can determine the outcome. Be able to play with such a system



you stumble upon a statement by an account and you also see a few of their other statements and completely disagree with them. What if you could run a query over all of their statements such as "how much overlap does their worldview have with mine"?
What if everyone could have such a computed score for every other account?

imagine being able to pick your "wikipedia editors" - people who curate information in the open web while building a track record - and then anyone would be able to filter information differently based on their own personal criteria - multiple times from different angles (perhaps also by adopting someone else's criteria?)

the future of search is being able to re-run aggregation & statistics based on different filters

timestamped events?
    farcaster - no, user reported timestamp
    "Delta timestamps can be used by applications when generating feeds of information for their users. Such timestamps are untrustworthy since they are user reported and the network cannot verify them. The timestamp trust model is like that of a blog where most users tend to be well behaved since a monitoring service at the application level can be used to detect timestamp abuse."

App id/name in URIs for content generated through them

proofs for the authorization or key ownership at the point of publication are not necessary! they can be reconstructed !!!

infra need to store signatures & proofs?

upper limit for total data on the network/protocol


Farcaster focuses on eventual consistency with CRDTs & Delta Graphs but the elephant in the room is different counts based on different filters which cannot be done with CRDTs easily.
ACTUALLY not sure if that's true :|
but perhaps CRDTs are just not as performant for trillions of likes
Our view is that using CRDTs is a constraint - like for example multi-dimensional follows with include/exclude filtering
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#3-delta-graph

limits on data? size & retention?
CRDTs are a limit for Farcaster.

https://hackmd.io/fCa8_RCEQ4qBYZjfnas9Zg



partial view of the network allowed?
    not for farcaster

Why go theough the trouble of dealing with crdts and constrains if youll solve just one basic case and not everything thats possible?


They aim for Hubs to have a complete view of the network and are aiming for everything to fit in 64TB o_O

"we limit users to storing a finite number of deltas for each type and calculate the limits to keep the size of the graph under 64 TB."




farcaster is too constraining because of the use of CRDTs
The system cannot be extended by anyone because the Hubs need to agree to run the software that handles any new message type. The protocol is tied to the infra.


Farcaster: a lot of complexity, a lot of limitations and no clear path to being general purpose & web-scale

- competition - finish it !!!

    - Point when comparing with others: multiple ways to ask for data from an URI as opposed to just a hash
    - a URI is not connected to multiple entities and not just a hash - the application & user
    - Others con - addressability does not include application names - no such direct client attribution mechanism
    
    - just because you can interlink everything with hashes doesn't mean that you should



    - page about the key rotation & anchoring problem and where does the key rotation & revocation data live & latencies? - aka WHY SEQUENCE THIS

- Point when comparing with others: 


ANCHORING IS NOT ENOUGH! - you need to know which event invalidated the previous one without having to check if it was invalidated




ordering guarantees?



Pruned sets - how/which data is stored by hubs
The protocol is trying to do too much
Very opinionated - way beyond just decentralized identity
the hub implementation has a lot of tough choices to make in regards to rate limiting, spam & storage limits/guarantees
there is a consensus algorithm about 
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj

farcaster makes the hubs a bottleneck for applications - instead of allowing different apps to provide their own storage

All this complexity of sets, CRDTs, pruning & size limitations stems from the inability to address content by users without it being created by the hub - a user's hub is a bottleneck for applications
What is a [CausalRemovesWinIfValid](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj) set?

> "We expect users to resign their messages when migrating between clients" - [source](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HJzK5VM4o)
wow...
"When a signer is removed, all messages signed by it present in other CRDT's must now be considered invalid and evicted from those CRDTs."
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#72-signers
however, even a custory address may change but it may re-authorize signers.
but if a signer was compromised you have to lose everything signed by it

A negative for headjack is that it's not trivial to obtain the latest version of a document for a URI - if it was deleted you'd probably need to ask the app or the IDM of the user if they have an update, but that update could have been submitted by another app



Without anchoring data with a Merkle proof and sequencing that in time, it is impossible for a document to be fully self-authenticating because it might have been signed with keys that have been compromised/revoked/rotated.

distinction: public vs private info

we can make anything referencable and because of the stable intra-document addressing and we can crowdsource a global reference heatmap of information

imagine being able to not see the same things multiple times when you open your feed multiple times and scroll a bit - having a "seen" list with URIs which you can later browse like the history in youtube - something like this should exist

different filters & thresholds for cold DMs - it should be easier for people from your communities to contact you. Such preferences should be possible.

the super app of superapps section
the superapp - the command center - as a chapter & what the gateway would be - what would the browser in the browser be like
the way to crowdsource the global superapp through which we could do anything is to decentralize identity, end the host-centric model & allow for a market to emerge for any type of index
The superapp section should go in "what really is"
we can turn the web into a personal computer for the public information
the superapp is the "how would you like to spend your attention" superapp


imagine browsing the public web like it was your personal files in your apps and drives - having total control of how you store and group that data. This could be the case with the public web. And we could advertise what kind of filters & grouping options we prefer with public messages which are not options. we can crowdsource preference and show which things are preferred. We can end the binary duopoly in politics by making all opinions and interests unbundled from each other


services will no longer have the host-centric model to point to as the reason for siloing data - just the fact that we would give an address to our documents that is beyond any specific host is enough of a reason for the nature of competition to change

the block/content explorer of this ecosystem will be the next google

page about IDMs and what they could personalize for you

A single on-chain message that updates an rpc/rest endpoint can redirect trillions of URIs and exabytes of data instantly - no global DHT used for individual elements

When a key is rotated it doesn’t affect old content for it to be self-authenticating

we will share the digital space with AIs and a web of trust on top of PKI will be incredibly important

granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations


When you show your Attention you get attention for it - in regards to the signaling

twitter has different subcommunities (FinTwit,AudioTwit,CT) - specialized UIs can have value flow embedded in them so different & unique business models could be used

2 types of edit commands: non-branching and branching
what if IDMs allow us to have pointers like HEAD in git?

just like we need IP over MAC addresses in order to have a hierarchy, for the same reason we need Headjack URIs on top of hashed data - the retrievability process is greatly improved



friendship should be: you have a DM channel open - without a filter



giving different types of permissions to IDMs - for example the ability to change your name without a sig from you

imagine being able to select a subset of all accounts worldwide and train a GPT on that subset of human knowledge & opinions

putting data in the real cloud - the one beyond hosts

what if apps have to explicitly pay to infra for their data to be stored?

chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji

spam protection: we can see the source of accounts that are often labeled as spam - if they are coming from a specific IDM (because it's much cheaper to create new accounts from an IDM)
fighting spam - in this system every event has provable provenance of who sent it and who their IDM is - we can track & label/exclude/punish IDMs that are the originators of spam - this is much better than the crude ways email fought spam - by blacklisting IP ranges and all that

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

Accounts are integers and the state tree should reflect that - doesnt need to be a trie based on crypto addresses


████████████████████████████████████████████████ EigenLayr



concern for using ETH instead of native token for staking
https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan/status/1555425874828095488



Polkadot analogy for Eigen layr - in fact it is way more efficient because the same capital can be restaked multiple times
However, if the same collateral is used to secure multiple rollups and something goes wrong with one of them and the collateral is slashed - that reduces the collateral for the other rollups too (if slashed by a lot). Polkadot could have implemented this but haven't - it makes the risks much harder to evaluate. Also when a layr gets restaked eth from different other layrs the risk is very unspecified.

Ask a bit more about celestia and their scale

1.3mb/s data availability for celestia requires 1gb/s speed




a few more points about Headjack:
- accounts are just integers and are not required to have keypairs by default
- most actions are done through authorized accounts and very few signatures are required
    - authorizations for X to post on behalf of Y is just a pair of 2 integers on-chain
- want this to be a cockroach with good liveness & to be as economically sound & capital efficient as possible
- should have sovereignity - not enshrined to a settlement layer
- bridging not necessary - only names will be sold on the chain
    - a marketplace can natively be built in the chain
- publication & creation network - not a transactional network
    - accounts can still handle tokens but very few will want/need to
- trivially shardable problem - X following Y only affects X

- unsure:
    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)
        - in-protocol incentivization?
            https://polynya.medium.com/the-endgame-bottleneck-historical-storage-e83c101d2a7c





- is having a single leader (sequencer) a problem for something being a cockroach?
    - can the sequencer be unidentifiable - just one of the p2p nodes without being known by IP?





- reading about clusters in the celestia blog - will it be necessary to use something like a zkEVM and have the entire logic of my chain be coded in that so that it can produce ZK proofs that the EVM understands?
    https://blog.celestia.org/clusters/
    "Likewise with ZK rollups, they need to understand the ZK proving systems of each other. If you wanted to create a rollup using a new execution environment, you have to create your own cluster or hard fork an existing cluster."


- zk
    - do validity proofs imply ZK tech?
    - would the state transition & logic need to be coded in something like Cairo?
        zksync - a zkEVM?


- EigenLayr
    - can EigenLayr be used for a PoS system?
        - liveness ==> needs PoS & a sequencer set?
    - can an EigenLayr service determine on its own how much should be restaked for it?
    - restaked eth - does that mean that the rollup might not need a native token?
        - what if the lack of a token impairs project growth & community building?
    - if there's a native token with 100M$ MC and there are just 10M$ of restaked eth - bad?
    - risk of failing
        - what if cannot attract restakers?
        - transition path for my project? different DA layer and moving away from the EigenLayr smart contracts?
    - restaking seems very similar as the crowdfunded polkadot parachain leases but there's no lower bound to how much security is needed to launch

    - is the DA layer shared by all rollups using DataLayr and will they fight for resources?
        - will many separate rollups on DataLayr share the same 10MB/s of DA throughput that has been achieved on the testnet with 100 nodes?
    - direct IPs and not using a p2p layer?
        - could DataLayr have been p2p and without public IPs?
        - how come DoS attacks are avoided too? mentioned here: https://youtu.be/OtUOXTqrSyg?t=1542


- Q: why is it hard to hard-fork a standalone chain but easier if consensus & DA are coming from Celestia?

== greatest challenges & open questions:
- rollup? sovereign chain? sharding? Near? Cosmos? Polkadot?
- tokenomics - value accrual not just through block space?
    - token model that is beyond "paying for blockspace" - smoothening out demand spikes & making it more predictable for services & companies
- process for name auctioning - preventing squatting & hoarding
- hiring









- I want investors who will be excited to continue building applications & infrastructure on top of Headjack and undestand/believe the vision - not just supporting for the initial blockchain.












- pros/cons table of building it as an Ethereum rollup - win the approval of the eth maxis

- make a glossary page

summary of last 2 months:
- fixed up the text & developed a few more pages (numbers, messages, account messages & social graph)
- completed the next chapter (motivational - problems & how headjack fixes them)
- decided to remove the interest graph from on-chain - leaving only authorization messages & keeping the blockchain state small
- developed the pitch deck
- actively looking for co-founders
- applied to a few conferences to talk about the idea
- researched ZK rollups - still not sure about it


- want to aligh with Ethereum & win that crowd - be on the right side of history


- rewritten the introductory page to cut the fluff and cut straight to the chase

- When I tell people that Headjack will change the world - I need to be able to prove it

- Tyler wants 1-2%, 6 months cliff for 75% of tokens, 6 more for the rest

- do you think getting a hold of Balaji or Naval is possible? My project is influenced mostly by their thinking around web3 & media

=== project liberty competition
    - Headjack is partially inspired by their whitepaper
    - slow R&D - 2 years already
    - decided to see where they are at 2 days ago
        - polkadot parachain development announced 2 months ago
        - some improvements in their design since I last looked at it
        - they have an answer to my economic worries - although I could have figured it out too eventually
        - biggest difference is addressing - very excited about the human readable URLs of Headjack
            - also other details which are not a deal breaker - but I think I can design the better system
            - it is bizzare to be so on-point about so many things and yet fail at addressing
                - however they *could* fix it
    - compete?
        - possible
            - no community & 0 buzz around them (yet)
            - not much code written yet - not launching anytime soon - they seem a bit slow
            - the lead spokesperson continues to be the old billionaire that funded it instead of the team leads
            - not a big enough team
            - they don't have a vision for what to build after the blockchain like I do - nor the passion it seems
        - challenges
            - they have:
                - huge backing by the billionaire - and he's actually a decent person & is doing it for the right reasons
                - official partnership with Polkadot
            - hard sell for Headjack as a polkadot parachain as it is very similar to the other one?
            - duplicated effort & fragmentation
            - hiring, a little bit behind
    - join them?
        - very little influence, very little reward
        - improbable that I'd convince them to use the better addressing & URLs
        - but higher chance of success




Frequency problems:
- Polkadot - not as decentralized as Eth






████████████████████████████████████████████████ The Architect

I'm starting to buy into the modular blockchain idea and am thinking of a validium rollup where the data availability is not on eth but on something like Celestia or DataLayr and only the ZK proof and the settlement is on Ethereum.

turns out the only way to make a zk rollup & have validity proofs is to use either starkware/zksync/or a few other players, and one can use Solidity for all of them:
https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1517108067787177984

but that would mean that the materialized rollup state for all accounts will resemble the ethereum state in terms of structure, so the merkle proofs for parts of the state will be dependent on how the state is implemented - what kind of trie, etc.

I have a very important goal, which is to minimize the size of merkle proofs for anything, as I think my chain would be used to request & generate much more merkle proofs than something financial

- would optimint (cosmos with DA & consensus from Celestia) be a good choice?

reply:
    if there is no "root" delegate that a user uses to delegate to others, then all users will need a keypair, and every time they delegate to a service they'd have to explicitly sign & post on-chain (perhaps the delegate could cover the costs).

    with hierarchical delegates a root delegate could even create accounts without keypairs and can then batch-submit lower-level delegations to services which will be just pairs of account integer ids and no signatures from specific end-users - much more compact
