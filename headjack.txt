> "Individual intelligence, in the familiar guise of a central nervous system or a brain, arises from the interaction of many unintelligent components (neurons) arranged in the right organisation with the right connections. This is the foundation of connectionism; that intelligence resides not in the individual parts but in the arrangement of the connections between them. The individual neuron is not where all the interesting cognition and learning occur. It is the distributed collective activity in the network that constitutes cognition and changes to the organisation of network connections that constitute learning." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137231168355#:~:text=Individual%20intelligence%2C%20in,that%20constitute%20learning.)

> "The curious thing about collective intelligence is that the more intelligent something is, the less it looks like a collective. When component members act in an efficiently coordinated manner, with behaviours that can be diverted from their short-term self-interest to serve long-term collective interest, a collective looks more like an individual at a higher level of organisation. Recognising this, biology is full of collective intelligence – not just in the weak sense of swarms and colonies with emergent behaviours but because any organism is actually an intelligent collective." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137231168355#:~:text=The%20curious%20thing,an%20intelligent%20collective.)

> "Although all cells in most multicellular organisms share the same genome, the remarkable protein machinery that genome encodes, along with the cytoskeletal and lipid structures each cell inherits from its ancestors, enables a collective of embryonic cells to develop differentiated roles and self-organise into a large-scale, functional machine. Development thus involves a multi-scale hierarchy of cooperating and competing subunits, each with local computational and goal-directed capacity, that enables the whole to function as a singular subject of memories and preferences – a unified locus of learning and homeostatic loops that harness its subunits towards goal states." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137231168355#:~:text=Although%20all%20cells,towards%20goal%20states.)

> "It is imperative to understand the developmental algorithms and signals by which tissue-level agents incentivise lower-level subunits (e.g. cells and molecular pathways), distorting their option space so that simple, local descent down free-energy paths (short-sighted self-interest) result in higher order adaptive activity (long-term collective interest). The key to being an individual is to have a functional structure in which diverse experiences across its components are bound together in a way that generates causal relationships and composite memories that belong to the higher space of the individual and not its components." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137231168355#:~:text=It%20is%20imperative,not%20its%20components)

Every year the number of ways to socially connect with others, even those in the most remote locations, increases exponentially, allowing for ever-greater information flow. This inevitably promotes greater social awareness and knowledge exchange. It is also a mathematical fact that increasing the number of connections between nodes increases the computational power of a network.

Curiously, it needs the help of humble mortals. This gives humanity a collective purpose: to assist the universe in its great awakening by ensuring that life persists. To see to it that this process is realized, we must overcome existential challenges by aligning our interests, which promotes cooperation and minimizes conflict. The new cosmic narrative creates an ethical, economic, and political philosophy that has the power to unify us in these divided times.

So much energy is wasted down the drain in ephemerality
Also:

the inability for anyone to programatically process public data flexibly and reliably in any way imaginable limits our capacity for collective self-introspection and error correction. The host-centric model must go.

We need to develop the mechanisms to continually bring our theory of the collective mind closer to reality and that involves error correction, reputation, transparency, and immutable history.



There is no bigger meta-goal than improving our capacity for cooperation and sensemaking. Nothing is beyond that.
there isn't anything bigger than trying to optimize the antroposcene

Our world is hopelessly broken - the american dream has been dead for decades and this is the culminatiom?!

we hold concepts in our minds singularly and can "browse" our memories that are connected to them - however/albeit inperfectly. But in the digital world concepts and entities are fractured and duplicated - there are many instances of the same thing and information is incoherent

We all feel a sense of desperation because things don't function well

We need to counter our evolutionary baggage such as keeping up with the joneses or any bias that is nowadays maladaptive

We can gradually reshape the matrix from the current form towards a crowdsourced one: A new world order - built upon consent and competence

If people are empowered to affect their system they will be inclined to think more about how it should function. When you buy a stock or asset - even with a tiny bit of capital - you start learning about markets and the specific asset you’ve bought. Skin in the game is empowering

In retrospect we will wonder how we could be contempt with what social media was in the first few decades of this century

Light is the best disinfectant

Amplification choice and transparency

Unique notification signatures (sounds, vibrations, icons, colors) help us disambiguate between sources and we can have less need to instantly check where the notification came from
Ambiguity sets off a mental process of us wandering “What was that?” - hiding the punchline, stimulating arousal, and leading to distraction

inconsequential notifications ("someone liked your photo") don't need to be delivered immediately - they can be batched - instead of the current way


Credits for queries - monetization for infra companies

People that have to use social media for work but dont want to get distracted can make different presets for the UI with different restrictions

How do we deprogram ourselves from the legacy from edward bernays


we are digital slaves - we don't truly own our data and we don't have a say what can be done with it. We are restricted in the actions we are allowed to take



“Closer to truth”
We must empower those with predictive power



your public process of doing something for others gives you credibility how well you're doing and that gives weight to your vote on something.

post physique reddit - how about post food? how about we crowdsource marketing for what we truly love and drown out advertising from broadcast media?

memes encode semantic structure - the one with Anakin and ", right?" as a template always has the same structure. We are pattern matching slots of ideas and expressions visually - how further could we push the encoding of information for more efficient communication?

we are at the absolute other end of the spectrum of where we should be - having just 2 main political views and media being aligned with them. We need to shard our attention into a million pieces

the next iteration of the mechanism and experiment that is America will be global and digital

heck, why don't we vote on our own top movies list like the oscars


Prestige should be based on predictive ability - track record and skin in the game












what if we had views with different levels of granularity and detail for the whole picture? one set of humans are labelers - a task that is easily checkable and quite unambiguous, but the actual view of the world was produced by combining different labelers with different weights based on their reputation? Neural nets have many layers - feature recognition, etc.

# Exploring the Matrix

Toggling layers of the graph or whatever - monetary layer - how money and influence flow

we should be able to look up if person X has ever made a statement about X, and what they said - for example how do you currently query all the podcasts of Naval if he has ever said anything about Edward Snowden? How do you query that? You simply can't.







accountability should be the gold-standard


The 8th social sin is power
Power must be earned

Epistemological bankruptcy - AI

If we publicly vote on interests it would be easier to form communities

Increasing the capacity to introspect globally

The internet 1.0 was connecting machines. The internet 2.0 connects ideas

This is how to collectively build our grand unifying narrative

The freedom to interact

Transparency infrastructure

civilizational error-correcting through transparency

What is the analog of active noise cancelling in the digital world?

Identity is about information and relations - transactionality is orthogonal


This is ultimate freedom in how we globally dissipate information

This is the interoperability protocol of the gaming metaverse as well

Artificial global intelligence is agi alignment

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

THIS IS AI ALIGNMENT - this is the alignment problem.
1. we must all have access to the data as easily and effortlessly as possible
2. we must use the crowdsourced competency and non-cancellation score when giving different weights of opinions.

Current AI is compression. Compression of sentiment

the way to alignment is towards increased transparency and accountability between us - we must create a cooperation environment to "train" (aka compress) the AI on

who watches the watchmen - who watches those that set the weights when training the models? what if the complete training could be separated into chunks as snapshots and we could occasionally pay extra to re-run the same part of the algorithm and compare results between expected and produced



imagine a media app and a set of algorithms and configuration options presented as a spreadsheet where for every cell someone is responsible, and the election for that cell is public and contains a debate map where we can filter the inputs of people based on the rules we determine are appropriate for us




Imagine a sankey diagram with the money flows

Also sankey diagram for liquid votes and influence


Giving a unique identifier to any concept and entity - the great deduplication

we're not going to stumble upon order as a byproduct of incremental changes - we have to rebuild everything from the ground up

== immune system chapter
We can crowdsource the weights for any algorithm
We need to shift the incentives from content to pure signal, delegation and actual impact
stated preference != revealed preference (aka behavior)!
    Just because I clicked on a car crash video or a cute cat doesn't mean thats all I want to see from now on
    stated vs revealed: I don't want to eat sugar, but I can't stop myself if I'm anywhere near it




== weights and parameters in algorithms
== crowdsourced algorithm weights & parameters & content modulation



we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

what if reputation had a computable value which you couldn't trade, but simply compute? No way to buy your way in - the only way being through a long enough track record?

Concern: no way to add friction when spreading information with sharing - how do you enforce that a link cannot be shared unless you’ve actually visited it? How do we combat the sharing of information based solely on the titles? Perhaps the signalling and labeling can come into play - ppl can show that a given app is not playing according to the good rules
Same about limiting the number of shares for a piece of content - perhaps up to 2 or 3 hops/levels
The further down a reshare chain (a reshare of a reshare of a reshare) - the more the distortion (razvalen gramofon)
If you want to share further beyond some limit you’d have to explicitly copy/paste it - this removes toxicity beyond a certain level

There should be no “magic/secret sauce” when it comes to recommendation algorithms. And we need to put the weights in the control of the users

We should think more carefully about the weights we give when ranking interactions
example: twitter's algorithm favors replies and gives a boost
what about CAD’s theorem of topic culture. A smart is less likely to receive a reply than a stupid post because it leaves less to be said, but a really full and comprehensive post will bring the conversation to a halt. 

Weights - should the reactions of someone who spends 8 hours a day online have the same weight as someone who reacts once a week or month? What if someone is producing 100 or 1000 times more content than the average account or more than the 99th percentile - should their ability to influence the ranking be the same as everybody else? Perhaps once you go beyond the activity of the 99th percentile you should start getting less and less impact for your actions for a rolling window
Compulsive social media users can (and do!) influence the algorithms for the rest of us
Something like the gini coefficient - capping and/or modulating the influence someone can have on the rest of us
Most people’s experience is asymmetrically influenced by “the compulsive few”
“The few, the proud, the compulsive”
Socially isolated people lean heavily on social media
Viral outbursts of anxiety


These are the types of questions and design decisions we’re simply not having and participating in because we’re outsiders for the social media platforms


What if there was a way to signal your preferred solution every time you comment on a problem? And what if we boosted responses that offer solutions/improvements? Inspired by solutions journalism

what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?

what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature

What if anyone could analyze the history of reactions of a post and see if there was an initial coordinated boost by some clique of connected accounts from a troll farm? Currrntly such analysis can be done only by insider data analysts

Identity can be computable





what if we could signal "back me up" for specific posts - leveraging our audience for select issues?

Feedback loop - you see what tags your audience expects and they see your content by tags if you’ve tagged it (or they could use AI to classify but that could be ambiguous)

We can show things in progress - suck as quitting smoking or participating in some challenge - justin.tv but with structured data

What if IDMs had to burn the native token when creating new accounts in a way similar to 1559? And what if this 1559 was not shared but per-idm? So that each IDM is throttled economically according to their own speed of growth?

There is no integration without extreme deduplication of data and identities











== ability to crowdsource badges/labels on accounts

Such collective individuals can have a higher problem-solving capacity than their members, because they can support a layered architecture with experience-dependent communication channels (synapses, broadly defined), emergence of “virtual governors” with beneficial properties with respect to control capacity, and more complex state space with more attractors and thus can compute meta-system properties not accessible to the single agents." - [The Computational Boundary of a “Self”: Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition, by Michael Levin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full#:~:text=The%20new%20Individual,the%20single%20agents)

Greed, at the single-cell level, for information (infotaxis) drives cooperativity, as each unit expands its measurement boundary (communication with neighbors) and thus inevitably becomes part of a bigger self with bigger set points serving as homeostatic attractors.

> "This property of gap junction coupling promotes the creation of a larger Self by partially erasing the mnemic boundaries between the parts which might impair their ability to work toward a common goal. This is a key part of the scaling of the Self by enlarging toward common goals—not by micromanagement, but by bringing multiple subunits into the same goal-directed loop by tightly coupling the sensing, memory, and action steps in a syncytium where all activity is bound toward a system-level teleonomic process." - [Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds, by Michael Levin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full#:~:text=this%20property%20of,level%20teleonomic%20process.)

> "Given the ability of human subunits to merge into even larger (social) structures, how do we construct higher-order Selves that promote flourishing for all? The multicellularity-cancer dynamic suggests that tight functional connections that blur cognitive boundaries among subunits is a way to increase cooperation and cognitive capacity. However, simply maximizing loss of identity into massive collectivism is a well-known failure at the social level, always resulting in the same dynamic: the goals of the whole diverge sharply from those of the parts, which become as disposable to the larger social Self as shed skin cells are to us. Thus, the goal of this research program beyond biology is the search for optimal binding policies between subunits, which optimize the tradeoffs needed to maximize individual goals and well-being (preserving freedom or empowerment) while reaping the benefits of a scaled-up Self at the level of groups and entire societies. While the specific binding mechanisms used by evolution are not guaranteed to be the policies we want at the social level, the study of these are critical for jump-starting a rigorous program of research into possible ways of scaling that could have social relevance." - [Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds, by Michael Levin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full#:~:text=Given%20the%20ability,have%20social%20relevance.)






> "The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress—the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system’s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness). Defined in this way, “stress” turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term duḥkha (otherwise often rendered as “suffering”), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so duḥkha is a continuous state that compels beings to act. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of “make and maintain a whole limb” of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives. It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=The%20central%20treadmill,of%20other%20beings.)

> "Stress drives agents towards homeostatic goals—a concept central to Buddhism with its teaching of existence as dissatisfaction, duḥkha. Expanding one’s space of possible goals to face outwards, exhibiting compassion toward other agents’ goals, potentiates the increase of intelligence and thus the potential to identify better, more global solutions. In this scheme, compassion (in the sense of practical concern) and intelligence are tightly linked because the driving definition of an active agent is the bundle of processes that expend energy toward system-level goals. The scale and content of what a given agent measures, prefers, and seeks to implement define its cognitive sophistication." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=Stress%20drives%20agents,its%20cognitive%20sophistication.)

Instead, the attention schema would depict something physically incoherent, a process without a physical manifestation – a mental possession or experience of something that empowers one to react to the item." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20attention%20schema%20would,react%20to%20the%20item.)

> "Why would the brain compute such an incomplete model of its own processes? Because that is all that is needed for the model to be useful. Just as the body schema does not need to represent the mechanistic and cellular details of the body in order to keep track of its general structure and current configuration, a detailed, complete, neuroscientific account of attention is not necessary for keeping track of the current state and general dynamics of attention." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=Why%20would%20the,dynamics%20of%20attention.)

> "Awareness is part of the control mechanism for attention. Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=awareness%20is%20part%20of%20the%20control%20mechanism,effect%20on%20behavior%20than%20it%20would%20otherwise.)

"individuals as neurons" chapter
the current host-centric world where platforms own our data and is siloed is preventing us as a giant global brain to wire any way we want


THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?








index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes




"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"




== The global connectome

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

we have maladaptive connections and lack (neuro)plasticity. The global brain lacks (neuro)plasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity



we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
inherit algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!




we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy








we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)























youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.













We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types - even if we have just watched a video like that?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?































https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory




== Computable context & SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs

what if we could see all the unique assertions a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that? What if we could analyze how their views changed throughout time?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts

what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?











shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"










we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability












Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations











deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

Accounts are integers and the state tree should reflect that - doesnt need to be a trie based on crypto addresses

1.3mb/s data availability for celestia requires 1gb/s speed

- unsure:
    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)
        - in-protocol incentivization?
            https://polynya.medium.com/the-endgame-bottleneck-historical-storage-e83c101d2a7c


- transition path for my project? different DA layer and moving away from the EigenLayr smart contracts?

- DataLayr
    - is the DA layer shared by all rollups using DataLayr and will they fight for resources?
        - will many separate rollups on DataLayr share the same 10MB/s of DA throughput that has been achieved on the testnet with 100 nodes?
    - direct IPs and not using a p2p layer?
        - could DataLayr have been p2p and without public IPs?
        - how come DoS attacks are avoided too? mentioned here: https://youtu.be/OtUOXTqrSyg?t=1542

- Q: why is it hard to hard-fork a standalone chain but easier if consensus & DA are coming from Celestia?

██████ unsorted

TODO: what about small entities like "year progress" - should they get a unique ID on-chain? Or some other light-weight account type should exist? maybe an "owned" off-chain index that's a child of the creator?

There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes
== ideas for apps:
- feed composer - from subscriptions - with pipes


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color




The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet




What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



unlocking the potential of the internet

Aiming to make politics downstream of science - not the other way around

Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.


apps that consume private indexes but done according to public rules and get them uniquely fingerprinted so that leaks are detected, those apps can stake a token in something escrow-like with an amount determined by market forces, and those that produce the indexes and give them with unique fingerprints could slash and/or confiscate their stake


> "Open state is the next step after open source. You don’t just release a copy of the frontend, you let anyone read and write to the same backend." - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1632833998442614784)



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model


2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership


Public actions should be regarded as public contributions



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"



global questions will have URIs that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"


NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing


make a mission section with a bunch of mission statements - that all come together in a whole


being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.


move from @handle to full names in citations in the book

So many ideas that can be implemented as a hackaton at any of the big social media companies are never even attempted - because it doesn’t serve their bottom line. Thats why the host-centric model must go

Logo/Cover photo idea: headjack which extends as a vortex/fractal of interconnectedness

== double addressing?
headjack://app_id/nonce/user_id/content_id
headjack2://user_id:concept_id


when we give a universal address to any item extensibility becomes trivial. Suppose you have a list of movies and you want to edit it in a way that's not allowed by the UI - what if you could write a script to fetch it, process it and re-upload the new version?


The 2 dirtiest words when it comes to the Twitter API: "rate limited" - read "innovation & insight limited"

we should disincentivize engagement farming

The google index for public data is private - it should be public infrastructure

fine-grained control
When viewing a post - have the ability to choose wether to respect the OP’s blocks and not see comments from blocked users or not


Economics is downstream of coordination


there isn't an ounce of fat to remove from this design - anything more minimalistic would complicate the mental model for working with the system.

!! NOT REALLY - identity


== clips
== improving audio & video

if someone uploads a clip someone can link it to the original content with timeline mapping so that one can view the original instead of the clip if they wish - similar to the "title change for less clickbait" stuff
"DISINCENTIVIZING DUPLICATION"
Todo: chapter about the movie maker - the timeline composer
clips are dysfunctional
clips are reuploaded because uploaders would get the revenue... this needs a solution

a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ... just kidding.

What happens to URIs with names that get used in a blob which doesnt get anchored immediately and name ownership changes before it gets anchored?
