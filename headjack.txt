the decision maker: build trees of predicates and based on truth for each of them you can determine the outcome. Be able to play with such a system



you stumble upon a statement by an account and you also see a few of their other statements and completely disagree with them. What if you could run a query over all of their statements such as "how much overlap does their worldview have with mine"?
What if everyone could have such a computed score for every other account?

The internet is rife with (deliberate) misinformation

a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

imagine being able to view a multi-level depth tree with all citations and conversations and conversations around those conversations and being able to filter the "outcome" based on criteria - labels/annotations/reactions and who we trust for placing those labels/annotations/reactions

imagine being able to pick your "wikipedia editors" - people who curate information in the open web while building a track record - and then anyone would be able to filter information differently based on their own personal criteria - multiple times from different angles (perhaps also by adopting someone else's criteria?)

the future of search is being able to re-run aggregation & statistics based on different filters

So what do we do about this world we are living in where content can be created by machines and ascribed to us?
I think we will need to sign everything to signify its validity. When I say sign, I am thinking cryptographically signed, like you sign a transaction in your web3 wallet.

timestamped events?
    farcaster - no, user reported timestamp
    "Delta timestamps can be used by applications when generating feeds of information for their users. Such timestamps are untrustworthy since they are user reported and the network cannot verify them. The timestamp trust model is like that of a blog where most users tend to be well behaved since a monitoring service at the application level can be used to detect timestamp abuse."

App id/name in URIs for content generated through them

proofs for the authorization or key ownership at the point of publication are not necessary! they can be reconstructed !!!

infra need to store signatures & proofs?

upper limit for total data on the network/protocol


Farcaster focuses on eventual consistency with CRDTs & Delta Graphs but the elephant in the room is different counts based on different filters which cannot be done with CRDTs easily.
ACTUALLY not sure if that's true :|
but perhaps CRDTs are just not as performant for trillions of likes
Our view is that using CRDTs is a constraint - like for example multi-dimensional follows with include/exclude filtering
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#3-delta-graph

limits on data? size & retention?
CRDTs are a limit for Farcaster.
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#33-bounding-graph-size
https://hackmd.io/fCa8_RCEQ4qBYZjfnas9Zg



partial view of the network allowed?
    not for farcaster

Why go theough the trouble of dealing with crdts and constrains if youll solve just one basic case and not everything thats possible?


They aim for Hubs to have a complete view of the network and are aiming for everything to fit in 64TB o_O

"we limit users to storing a finite number of deltas for each type and calculate the limits to keep the size of the graph under 64 TB."




farcaster is too constraining because of the use of CRDTs
The system cannot be extended by anyone because the Hubs need to agree to run the software that handles any new message type. The protocol is tied to the infra.


Farcaster: a lot of complexity, a lot of limitations and no clear path to being general purpose & web-scale

- competition - finish it !!!

    - Point when comparing with others: multiple ways to ask for data from an URI as opposed to just a hash
    - a URI is not connected to multiple entities and not just a hash - the application & user
    - Others con - addressability does not include application names - no such direct client attribution mechanism
    
    - just because you can interlink everything with hashes doesn't mean that you should



    - page about the key rotation & anchoring problem and where does the key rotation & revocation data live & latencies? - aka WHY SEQUENCE THIS

- Point when comparing with others: 


ANCHORING IS NOT ENOUGH! - you need to know which event invalidated the previous one without having to check if it was invalidated




ordering guarantees?



Pruned sets - how/which data is stored by hubs
The protocol is trying to do too much
Very opinionated - way beyond just decentralized identity
the hub implementation has a lot of tough choices to make in regards to rate limiting, spam & storage limits/guarantees
there is a consensus algorithm about 
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj

farcaster makes the hubs a bottleneck for applications - instead of allowing different apps to provide their own storage

All this complexity of sets, CRDTs, pruning & size limitations stems from the inability to address content by users without it being created by the hub - a user's hub is a bottleneck for applications
What is a [CausalRemovesWinIfValid](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj) set?

> "We expect users to resign their messages when migrating between clients" - [source](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HJzK5VM4o)
wow...
"When a signer is removed, all messages signed by it present in other CRDT's must now be considered invalid and evicted from those CRDTs."
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#72-signers
however, even a custory address may change but it may re-authorize signers.
but if a signer was compromised you have to lose everything signed by it

A negative for headjack is that it's not trivial to obtain the latest version of a document for a URI - if it was deleted you'd probably need to ask the app or the IDM of the user if they have an update, but that update could have been submitted by another app



Without anchoring data with a Merkle proof and sequencing that in time, it is impossible for a document to be fully self-authenticating because it might have been signed with keys that have been compromised/revoked/rotated.

when youtube removes a video of yours - it should still be available by you.


history of seen tweets - like history of watched videos on youtube

ability to set priorities for notifications and build a "home dashboard" that takes those into account

farcaster implies a bottleneck with the user's hub

We should all want informational freedom when it comes to querying public information

stability of identifiers is crucial for relational databases.
The relational model is built on the premise of stable identifiers.

Encoding metadata in the uri avoids the need for requests

your "desktop" for the apps & public data of the world

social aggregation: the mirror within - as a chapter name about signaling of public preferences & poll opinions
why are twitter polls only for 24 hours? and we can't see how specific people voted?
abstract polling: count & filter the results from any poll using any KYC filter or whatever ban list (so include/exclude for groups of people)
Reputation page and the message types that polls could be
The need for structured data - chapter
Structured data as a chapter - about polls and reputations
every claim and counter should be verifiable - even if at a processing cost
common knowledge should go there?

applications can decide which sets of filters are allowed for viewing media through them, in order for advertisers to be happy

boosting the competent through ranking their public information & track record objectively & transparently
we need to build the public introspection tool

bringing capitalism to media - slide in pitch with the narrow waist and MxN

distinction: public vs private info
Public vs private posting. Choosing which preferences to show to all

copy & follow the viewing preferences of others

we can make anything referencable and because of the stable intra-document addressing and we can crowdsource a global reference heatmap of information

imagine being able to not see the same things multiple times when you open your feed multiple times and scroll a bit - having a "seen" list with URIs which you can later browse like the history in youtube - something like this should exist

different filters & thresholds for cold DMs - it should be easier for people from your communities to contact you. Such preferences should be possible.

this would be the ultimate subscription network - where you could subscribe to any type of data feed - as long as there's a business model for it and demoand

the super app of superapps section
the superapp - the command center - as a chapter & what the gateway would be - what would the browser in the browser be like
the way to crowdsource the global superapp through which we could do anything is to decentralize identity, end the host-centric model & allow for a market to emerge for any type of index
The superapp section should go in "what really is"
we can turn the web into a personal computer for the public information
the superapp is the "how would you like to spend your attention" superapp


imagine browsing the public web like it was your personal files in your apps and drives - having total control of how you store and group that data. This could be the case with the public web. And we could advertise what kind of filters & grouping options we prefer with public messages which are not options. we can crowdsource preference and show which things are preferred. We can end the binary duopoly in politics by making all opinions and interests unbundled from each other


services will no longer have the host-centric model to point to as the reason for siloing data - just the fact that we would give an address to our documents that is beyond any specific host is enough of a reason for the nature of competition to change

the block/content explorer of this ecosystem will be the next google

page about IDMs and what they could personalize for you

A single on-chain message that updates an rpc/rest endpoint can redirect trillions of URIs and exabytes of data instantly - no global DHT used for individual elements

When a key is rotated it doesn’t affect old content for it to be self-authenticating

Insight: names are most useful when in document URIs - not used to identify your personal finances publicly

Global vs local for the feed - locality of information & notifications!

composable media - pick a recommender algo, search, UI

Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations

focus more on the separation of actual data and the presentation layer for archiving?

we will share the digital space with AIs and a web of trust on top of PKI will be incredibly important

granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations


When you show your Attention you get attention for it - in regards to the signaling

twitter has different subcommunities (FinTwit,AudioTwit,CT) - specialized UIs can have value flow embedded in them so different & unique business models could be used

2 types of edit commands: non-branching and branching
what if IDMs allow us to have pointers like HEAD in git?

just like we need IP over MAC addresses in order to have a hierarchy, for the same reason we need Headjack URIs on top of hashed data - the retrievability process is greatly improved



friendship should be: you have a DM channel open - without a filter



giving different types of permissions to IDMs - for example the ability to change your name without a sig from you

imagine being able to select a subset of all accounts worldwide and train a GPT on that subset of human knowledge & opinions

putting data in the real cloud - the one beyond hosts

what if apps have to explicitly pay to infra for their data to be stored?

chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be

fighting spam - in this system every event has provable provenance of who sent it and who their IDM is - we can track & label/exclude/punish IDMs that are the originators of spam - this is much better than the crude ways email fought spam - by blacklisting IP ranges and all that

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

Accounts are integers and the state tree should reflect that - doesnt need to be a trie based on crypto addresses


████████████████████████████████████████████████ EigenLayr



concern for using ETH instead of native token for staking
https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan/status/1555425874828095488



Polkadot analogy for Eigen layr - in fact it is way more efficient because the same capital can be restaked multiple times
However, if the same collateral is used to secure multiple rollups and something goes wrong with one of them and the collateral is slashed - that reduces the collateral for the other rollups too (if slashed by a lot). Polkadot could have implemented this but haven't - it makes the risks much harder to evaluate. Also when a layr gets restaked eth from different other layrs the risk is very unspecified.

Ask a bit more about celestia and their scale

1.3mb/s data availability for celestia requires 1gb/s speed




a few more points about Headjack:
- accounts are just integers and are not required to have keypairs by default
- most actions are done through authorized accounts and very few signatures are required
    - authorizations for X to post on behalf of Y is just a pair of 2 integers on-chain
- want this to be a cockroach with good liveness & to be as economically sound & capital efficient as possible
- should have sovereignity - not enshrined to a settlement layer
- bridging not necessary - only names will be sold on the chain
    - a marketplace can natively be built in the chain
- publication & creation network - not a transactional network
    - accounts can still handle tokens but very few will want/need to
- trivially shardable problem - X following Y only affects X

- unsure:
    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)
        - in-protocol incentivization?
            https://polynya.medium.com/the-endgame-bottleneck-historical-storage-e83c101d2a7c





- is having a single leader (sequencer) a problem for something being a cockroach?
    - can the sequencer be unidentifiable - just one of the p2p nodes without being known by IP?





- reading about clusters in the celestia blog - will it be necessary to use something like a zkEVM and have the entire logic of my chain be coded in that so that it can produce ZK proofs that the EVM understands?
    https://blog.celestia.org/clusters/
    "Likewise with ZK rollups, they need to understand the ZK proving systems of each other. If you wanted to create a rollup using a new execution environment, you have to create your own cluster or hard fork an existing cluster."


- zk
    - do validity proofs imply ZK tech?
    - would the state transition & logic need to be coded in something like Cairo?
        zksync - a zkEVM?


- EigenLayr
    - can EigenLayr be used for a PoS system?
        - liveness ==> needs PoS & a sequencer set?
    - can an EigenLayr service determine on its own how much should be restaked for it?
    - restaked eth - does that mean that the rollup might not need a native token?
        - what if the lack of a token impairs project growth & community building?
    - if there's a native token with 100M$ MC and there are just 10M$ of restaked eth - bad?
    - risk of failing
        - what if cannot attract restakers?
        - transition path for my project? different DA layer and moving away from the EigenLayr smart contracts?
    - restaking seems very similar as the crowdfunded polkadot parachain leases but there's no lower bound to how much security is needed to launch


- DataLayr
    - is the DA layer shared by all rollups using DataLayr and will they fight for resources?
        - will many separate rollups on DataLayr share the same 10MB/s of DA throughput that has been achieved on the testnet with 100 nodes?
    - direct IPs and not using a p2p layer?
        - could DataLayr have been p2p and without public IPs?
        - how come DoS attacks are avoided too? mentioned here: https://youtu.be/OtUOXTqrSyg?t=1542


- Q: why is it hard to hard-fork a standalone chain but easier if consensus & DA are coming from Celestia?

██████ unsorted


There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes


start with the problems in each page?


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color


elly iska6e da iztrie komentar na snimkata si - dori i da moje da bude komentirana drugade s URL... proximity matters...


The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet


Offchain name registry


What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



What is a broker? IDB and not IDM?



unlocking the potential of the internet



Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model



2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/


IDMs could be responsible for producing "streams" of the user activity - by simply referencing all activity from other applications (applications either need to notify the IDMs or IDMs need to monitor everything - for private data they probably need to be explicitly notified?)



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs
