WITH TECHNOLOGY, WE CAN FINALLY UPGRADE THE WAY WE PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNMENT
Imagine:
THE MOST INFORMED AND INCLUSIVE NATION-WIDE DEBATES POSSIBLE
RESEARCH-DRIVEN POLICY DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT THE POLITICS
TOTALLY INCLUSIVE AND TRANSPARENT REPRESENTATION


> "We waste so much time repeating old arguments and running in opposite directions. The internet looked like it would ease the problem by giving us access to vast knowledge and each of us a voice. It seems to have made the situation worse by overwhelming us with disorganized, contradictory information. Social media amplifies bias and creates echo chambers." - ["Canonical Debate Lab" paper](ttps://github.com/canonical-debate-lab/paper#i-abstract:~:text=We%20waste%20so,creates%20echo%20chambers.)

> "The problem is structural in nature, and therefore can be solved with a structural fix."

> "The state of debate as it occurs online is particularly ineffectual and disorganized. None of the technologies in use today (with the exception of email and a few others) were available twenty years ago, and yet with this incredible growth in capability, we have failed to address fundamental issues with deliberation, and created many new ones."

How could we reward people for annotating content? Perhaps in a way that reaches consensus even with "the other side"?
We could engineer the dopamine of this informational global brain.

The limiting factor: data processing



a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.





what if instead of caring if someone liked your nonsense tweet you had cast a vote and can see if others vote the same way as you - not liking a textual comment of yours, but you influencing them to vote the same way you did






Computable context





We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?


we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?


what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?


Its all about choice & agency.


why can't we crowdsource "top 10 videos that everyone should watch"


what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature










“The need for structure”




If we can annotate facts and claims then we’d be able to track the provenance of ideas - or at least view their first occurance



what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?








== SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs













shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"











we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability




heatmaps





imagine being able to crowdsource debate requests with specific people and see a ranking of which debates are most desired





imagine browsing the public web like it was your personal files in your apps and drives - having total control of how you store and group that data. This could be the case with the public web. And we could advertise what kind of filters & grouping options we prefer with public messages which are not options. we can crowdsource preference and show which things are preferred. We can end the binary duopoly in politics by making all opinions and interests unbundled from each other


Global vs local for the feed - locality of information & notifications!



Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations



twitter has different subcommunities (FinTwit,AudioTwit,CT) - specialized UIs can have value flow embedded in them so different & unique business models could be used



imagine being able to select a subset of all accounts worldwide and train a GPT on that subset of human knowledge & opinions






spam
https://prnt.sc/ORguwjXfLgLR





deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

100 ways to describe Headjack:
- not engineered for a % of the market - engineered for the entire market
- cheaper, faster, better
- Headjack's block/content explorer is the next Google

- Moving everyone on a shared identity layer needs to happen only once. It's a matter of time. Why not simply look at the best protocol in terms of merits and shoot with it?
- Lets create the theoretically most secure and scalable solution to this problem.
- Lets tell the best story of why it's necessary.
- And let's not botch the tokenomics.
- The timestamp machine
- The universal network effect
- Untransferrable property rights for data
- fixing competition in media

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)

██████ unsorted


There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes


start with the problems in each page?


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color


elly iska6e da iztrie komentar na snimkata si - dori i da moje da bude komentirana drugade s URL... proximity matters...


The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet


Offchain name registry


What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



What is a broker? IDB and not IDM?



unlocking the potential of the internet



Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.



> "Open state is the next step after open source. You don’t just release a copy of the frontend, you let anyone read and write to the same backend." - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1632833998442614784)



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model



2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?

IDMs could be responsible for producing "streams" of the user activity - by simply referencing all activity from other applications (applications either need to notify the IDMs or IDMs need to monitor everything - for private data they probably need to be explicitly notified?)



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"
