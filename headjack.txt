> "What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions."

> "Television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?" - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/685783-in-america-everyone-is-entitled-to-an-opinion-and-it#:~:text=television%20is%20altering,to%20be%20knowledge%3F)

The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools.

> "If everybody here plays generous [Tit-for-tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat), and I play always cooperate, I'm a neutral mutant, I have no disadvantage. Random drift can lead to the takeover of the neutral mutant. Or, in other words, if birds go to an island where there are no predators, they lose their ability to fly. A biological trait, to be evolutionary stable, must be under selection. The retaliation, sometimes retaliation against defection goes out if nobody's trying to defect. So you've got to always cooperate by random drift. But if we'd always cooperate, now we can guess what happens next: we invite Always defect. You have oscillations here, you have a mathematical model of human history, of economic cycles, of ups and downs.
>
> There is one thing that I have learned in my studies of cooperation over the last 20 years: there is no equilibrium. There is never a stable equilibrium. Cooperation is always being destroyed and has to be rebuilt. How much time you spend on average in a cooperative state depends on how quickly you can rebuild it. The most important aspect is really how quickly you can get away from the Always defect again." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=If%20everybody%20here,Always%20defect%20again.)

> "Indirect reciprocity. I help you and that gives me the reputation of a helpful person, and then others help me. So if I don't help you my reputation decreases, if I do help you my reputation increases.
>
> We know how this works from the way evaluations work on E-Bay. For example, you make a deal, you get a good evaluation, your value goes up. We have also played experimental games where people can purchase reputation, they can trade reputation if they have good reputation, so we can actually determine the price of a good reputation in experimental situations. This indirect reciprocity relies on gossip; some people might have an interaction and others observe it, and others talk about it. We are obsessed with gossip. We are obsessed with talking about others and how it would be to interact with them...
>
> What is very important for efficient indirect reciprocity is language. Indirect reciprocity leads to the evolution of social intelligence and human language. In order to evaluate the situation, you have to understand who does what to whom and why. And we have to have a way to talk about what happened, to gain experience from others.
>
> As my friend David Haig at Harvard put it very nicely, "For direct reciprocity you need a face; for Indirect reciprocity you need a name." And I find this beautiful because there is a lot in a face. A lot can be read from facial features. A big part of our brain is there to recognize faces, so we can recognize with whom the interaction was, to play simultaneous repeated games. But for Indirect reciprocity that's not enough; we also need a name." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=Indirect%20reciprocity.%20I%20help,also%20need%20a%20name.)

> "Spatial selection is the idea that neighbors help each other. Neighbors form clusters, or you and your friends have many interactions and you cooperate, and you can even be an unconditional cooperator with your friends, and that can work out. This is an evolutionary graph theory where you have a social network and people interact with others on the graph. More recently, we also developed more a powerful mathematical approach that we call evolutionary set theory, where you belong to certain sets, for example, the Mathematics Department, the Biology Department, Harvard, or MIT, or the gym, or the tennis club, and I interact with people in that set. I cooperate with the people in the set and I try to join sets of successful individuals. So the extension to classical evolutionary game theory here is in classic evolutionary game theory, people imitate successful strategies. Here they imitate successful strategies in successful locations. They want to move into successful locations, and that can give rise to this clustering that allows evolution of cooperation." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=Spatial%20selection%20is,evolution%20of%20cooperation.)

> "Five mechanisms for cooperation: kin selection: the idea is cooperation with genetic relatives; direct reciprocity: I help you, you help me; indirect reciprocity: I help you, somebody helps me; spatial selection: clusters of cooperators or neighbors to help each other; group selection: groups of cooperators out compete other groups." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=I%20have%20discussed,compete%20other%20groups.)

> "What I find very interesting in these games of conditional reciprocity, direct and indirect reciprocity, we can make the point that winning strategies have the following three properties: they must be generous, hopeful and forgiving.
>
> Generous in the following sense: if I have a new interaction, now I realize (and this is I think where most people go wrong) that this is not a game where it's either the other person or me who is winning. Most of our interactions are not like a tennis game in the US Open where one person loses and one person goes to the next round. Most of our interactions are more like let us share the pie and I'm happy to get 49 percent, but the pie is not destroyed. I'm willing to make a deal, and sometimes I accept less than 50 percent. The worst outcome would be to have no deal at all. So in that sense, generous means I never try to get more than the other person. Tit-for-tat never wins in any single encounter; neither does Generous Tit-for-tat.
>
> Hopeful is that if there is a new person coming, I start with cooperation. My first move has to be cooperation. If a strategy starts with defection, it's not a winning strategy.
>
> And forgiving, in the sense that if the other person makes a mistake, there must be a mechanism to get over this and to reestablish cooperation." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=What%20I%20find,to%20reestablish%20cooperation.)

> "In this indirect reciprocity, the added complication is with the social norm that is used by people to evaluate interactions between others. That social norm itself should be the product of evolution, and that's something that nobody has really described yet because that's usually a given in a group. We think that cooperating with somebody with a good reputation gives you a good reputation. Cooperating with somebody with bad reputation gives you a bad reputation. This kind of social norm also must evolve." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=In%20this%20indirect,also%20must%20evolve.)

What started off as an escape from authority is now tending towards the very kind of thing it escaped from. “Believe the science,” they say.

> "The era of the open Internet as a decentralized technology platform for the benefit of individuals and not to be overseen and run by governments is over. The [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act) I think is one of the most overreaching threats to any sort of open, transparent, democratic opportunity on the Internet. The idea of the open Internet - the idea of creating a network of computers that could share information and make services available to individuals around the world freely, uncensored, and in an easy to access way - was the reason that the Internet has transformed society, improved productivity, and provided extraordinary benefits. The [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act) is an example of a government seeing that a decentralized technology - the Internet itself is is meant to be a decentralized technology - there's no central servers, they are all part of a network of computers that anyone on the network can access anything else on the network, blockchain obviously is the more modern kind of exciting, you know, decentralized technology concept that is meant to avoid the scrutiny, the oversight and the control by central governments or central authorities of any sort. And the language in the [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act) I think got squeezed through in a way that most of the people that I'm guessing passed this [Digital Services Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Services_Act) don't fully comprehend the implications of some of the decisions that they're making. It can be easily framed as this is good for people: you cannot sell illegal content online, you cannot sell illegal goods and services, we're trying to safeguard young people. But the protection of minors means that you can no longer do personalized web experiences for anyone under 18, which means you need to know the age of everyone, and now your web experience if you're a kid is not going to be personalized. The overreach gets even worse when they say we can now go in and run evaluations of the algorithms and allow open access to your data to third-party researchers to get into your systems and look at how you guys are running the services that you're offering on the Internet. So not only are you no longer allowed to have an open Internet where people can provide whatever services they want to provide, but if you're on the Internet you now have to make your service and the inside part of your service available for scrutiny by governments... And the way it's written it gives this commission as the primary regulator effectively a lot of leeway in deciding who, what, where, and how - they can go into companies, go into individual servers, individual computers - I could run an individual company on my computer at home and it gives this government the legal right in the EU to go into my computer and pull information out of my computer and scrutinize it and make decisions about what I'm doing and whether or not I'm compliant with whatever the commission's enforcement standards are of that day. I mean this is about as [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) as you can get and it's a real serious threat - I don't think people are recognizing the second and third order effects of what this is going to do over time to Internet services, to the quality of experience we get on the Internet, and to the role that government is now going to play in policing, scrutinizing, and providing restricted access to content and services for each individual that wants to use the Internet." - [David Friedberg](https://youtu.be/65-x2YVUugE?t=3172)

> "So if you translate this into necessary and insufficient conditions - what seems to be necessary for the emergence of general intelligence in a bunch of cells or units is that basically each of them is a small agent which means it's able to behave with an expectation of minimizing future target value deviations. So it learns that there are configurations of the environment that signal anticipated reward. Next thing - these units need to be not just agents - they need to be connected to each other and they need to get their rewards or proxy rewards - something that allows them to anticipate whether the organism is going to feed them in the future - from other units that are also adaptive. So you need multiple message types and the ability to recognize and send them with a certain degree of reliability." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/kgMFnfB5E_A?t=6746)


> "I wonder how to implement this in a self-organized fashion - if the substrate that you have are individual agents and there is a similarity here between societies and brains and social networks. That is: if you have self-interested agents in a way that try to survive and that get their rewards from other agents that are similar to them structurally, and they have the capacity to learn to some degree, and that capacity is sufficient so they can in the aggregate learn arbitrary programs - arbitrary computable functions - and it's efficient enough so they can converge on the functions that they need to as a group reap rewards - that apply to the whole group - because they have a shared destiny: like the poor little cells that are locked in the same skull and they are all going to die together if they up. So they have to get along, they have to form an organization that is distributing rewards among each other, and this gives us a search space for possible systems that can exist and the search space is mostly given I think by the minimal agent that is able to learn how to distribute rewards efficiently while doing something useful - using these rewards to change how you do something useful. So you have an emerging form of governance in these systems that's not some centralized control that is imposed on the system from the outside as an existing machine learning approaches and AI approaches, but this only is an emergent pattern in the interactions between the individual small units - small reinforcement learning agents - and this control architecture leads to hierarchical government. It's not fully decentralized in any way - there are centralized structures that distribute rewards - for instance via the dopaminergic system - and in a very centralized top-down manner, and that's because every regulation has an optimal layer where it needs to take place: some stuff needs to be decided very high up, some stuff needs to be optimally regulated very low down - depending on the incentives. Game theoretically a government is an agent that imposes an offset on your payoff metrics to make your [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) compatible with the globally best outcome. Right, so to do this you need to have agents that are sensitive to rewards. It's super interesting to think about these reward infrastructures. Elon Musk has bought Twitter I think because he has realized that Twitter is the network of among all the social networks that is closest to a global brain. It's totally mind-blowing to realize that he basically trades a bunch of frothy stock for the opportunity to become Pope. Pope of a religion that has more active participants than Catholicism even, right, daily practitioning people who enter this church and think together and it's a thing that is completely incoherent at this point - almost and completely incoherent. There are bubbles of sentience but for the most part this thing is just screeching at itself. And now the interesting question question: can we fix the incentives of Twitter to turn it into a global brain? And Elon Musk is global brain pilled - he believes that this is the case and that's the experiment that he is trying to do which makes me super excited, right, this might fail - there's a very big chance that it fails, but there is also the chance that we get the global brain - that we get emerging collective intelligence is working in real time using the internet in a way that didn't exist before. So super fascinating thing that might happen here, and it's fascinating that very few people are seeing this that Elon Musk is crazy enough to spend 44 billion dollars on that experiment - just because he can and has nothing else to do and thinks it's meaningful to do it - more meaningful than having so much money in the bank. Right, so this makes me interested in this test bed for rewards and this is something that translates into the way in which society is organized, because social media is not different from society - not separate from it - problem of governing social media is exactly the same thing as governing a society: you need a right form of government, you need a legal system, ultimately you need representation, and all these issues, right - it's not just the moderation team. And the same thing is also true for the brain: what is the government of the brain that emerges in what Gary Edelman calls neural Darwinism among different forms of organization in the mind until you have a model of a self-organizing agent that discovers that what it's computing is driving the behavior of an agent in the real world and discovers a first person perspective and so on. How does that work? How can we get a system that is looking for the right incentive architecture?" - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/kgMFnfB5E_A?t=6054)




> "It's like a conductor in an orchestra - consciousness is not some mental modular superpower - it's basically like one of many instruments in this orchestra that has a specific task compared to the other instruments - environmental orchestra - that compute functions of the cognitive domains. It's that it listens for incoherence and tries to minimize this incoherence in the orchestra so everybody is on the same page and we get coherent behavior that is coherent with motivational constraints, perceptual constraints, and so on. And this is, I think, the purpose of consciousness - to basically act as a conductor that is increasing coherence. So how does this work? Well in our own brain - as far as I can see - it's a completely self-organizing substrate. So unlike a GPU, this is not organized by an engineer who puts it onto a tip and then imposes an algorithm that is forced onto all the transistors that have no choice but to behave according to the spec of a designer and executes an algorithm that somebody has written up and then is run on that substrate no matter whether it wants or not. Right, and in our brain this is very different because our brain is not made out of aimless transistors - it is made out of single-celled animals that have shared destiny and need to survive and they can only survive if they find some kind of arrangement between each other that allows the organism to find food for the neurons. So this is the situation that they're in and as a result they get some emerging organization - a self-organization from inside out - and there's no point and no point a global structure that is not the result of some inside out growing self-organization. Right, and so if you build an information processing system - like a machine learning system - out of completely self-organizing elements: what does this look like? And I think what it looks like is not anything like the current machine learning algorithms - it's something where you need to create increasing coherence. So you create an island of coherence at first - something that has a coherent reward language and semantic language of thought so to speak - and that is then growing and is colonizing the cortex into a coherent pattern that allows you to explain reality. And at the core of this - to make this happen - this coherence happen - is the self-observing observer. It's the minimal coherent pattern, right, it's something that notices "I'm here, I'm observing, and so I'm growing out" - it's quite beautiful because it's basically the core of the card's meditation. [Cogito, ergo sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum) I think is not some philosophical statement about ontology that allows you to make a derivation - it's the strategy that you can introspectively observe when you wake up in the morning. Right, I start out with "Oh here I am, what is this world around me, how can I make sense of it" and then I branch out and integrate all these patterns until they become percepts in my world model. Right, so you need to take these individual agents - the neurons - and reward them by giving them a quote that is message passing in it, some of these messages mean that say you did well in our architecture or you didn't do well and they get rewarded for being trainable in this way, and these individual units they can exchange messages via neurotransmitters or even complicated functions potentially by exchanging RNA with their neighbors, and so on. There's a bunch of things that these cells can do in principle and this determines the search space for processes where consciousness is going to emerge. Right, it has to emerge in the structure as this process that is going to organize it - like a government emerges in a society at some point - and the government works first of all by noticing that it decides to be a government, and what this entails and then starts to impose structure on the environment around it, and it's competing with other proto governments until something takes over. Right, there's some kind of neural evolution. So does consciousness come first or last? A lot of people feel that it's so advanced that probably only people are conscious and it's really the pinnacle of development of cognitive agency, but I don't see people becoming conscious after the PhD, right, they really are conscious before they can track a finger and that suggests that maybe consciousness is not the result of you interacting with the world very deeply as an organism, but maybe it's the prerequisite for learning anything. Right, maybe it's the simplest learning algorithm that nature can discover for a complex recurrent brain-like structure that is self-organizing. If that is the case - it's a hypothesis, right - then this gives us a hint of how we could search for it, right, we could set up something that is truly self-organizing and is incentivized to process information - that is getting rewarded if it succeeds in it and punished if it doesn't, and then we might have a search space that is small enough so the same thing happens as it happens spontaneously in the brain of every infant or a fetus, and it's organizing itself into a structure that suddenly you have this amazing phase transitions where it starts to learn efficiently more complicated things. Right, and so I suspect that consciousness might be discovered in our brain before other learning algorithms - most of them - they're probably simpler [hebbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory) learnings like stuff, but once you go beyond this you probably need constructive agency. And consciousness is basically an operator that the brain is discovering to increase its coherence globally and it can evolve in something like a neural darwinism - something like an evolution that happens in every single brain among organizational patterns in the brain and your genetics of course are going to bias that evolution so it's going to converge much faster than otherwise would, but it seems still to be working in everybody, right, so no matter how mutated you are, no matter how many lesions you get in your brain - almost every time it works you become conscious and then you figure yourself out to some degree. Right, and if you don't - you are a vegetable: you never learn anything, you never talk to other people, it's never going to work out to anything. Right, so consciousness is really the prerequisite, but it also is surprisingly resilient given the number of things that you can do to an infant or a fetal brain and it's still going to develop into something viable. So it's basically something that colonizes the brain with a structure that is compatible with building a learning architecture that is able to interpret reality. So consciousness in this sense could be actually the creator of our mind and our world model and the self model." - [Joscha Bach - Consciousness as a coherence-inducing operator](https://youtu.be/qoHCQ1ozswA?t=644)

> "The task of consciousness in such an architecture would be the definition of a reward language, credit assignment to the individual units - how much do they perform with respect to the global reward, and the evaluation that what's happening in here in this thing - what is the largest possible now that we can create inside of the system, the interpretation of features in terms of how does this relate to our world model, how can we interpret all the perceptual features and so on, sensory features, patterns that show up in the system as parts of a model of the world, and how can we perform construction when we need to ..., how we can we learn how to reason and so on - build lots and lots of tools that allow us to create a reality and fix it." - [Joscha Bach - Consciousness as a coherence-inducing operator](https://youtu.be/qoHCQ1ozswA?t=1215)

Joscha Bach - Consciousness as a coherence-inducing operator

> "I used to think that consciousness might be a side effect of the way in which cognition works in human brains and that other systems that process information in the service of agency are not necessarily conscious. And while I still consider that to be possible, I think it's also conceivable that consciousness at some shape or form is crucial to make sense of the world. Basically perception is following gradients and it's converging to a certain state and if you just follow a gradient you don't even need to have memory of where you're coming from. But certain kinds of reality interpretation require construction and construction cannot follow a gradient - construction needs to make experiments and remember which experiments worked and why and then recall this and use the knowledge of that. So it needs to make index memories of the operations that it performed and it also requires some kind of central organization. To construct, you need to develop a central plan and then act on that central plan. So you have some kind of top-down localized imposition of a low dimensional function on the entirety of perception and it could be that this coincides to a very large degree with the functionality of attentional consciousness and basically consciousness in the role of a government. And the government is an agent that is imposing an offset on the payout metrics of individual participants in the system to make the [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) compatible with the common good. So it's basically overcoming local incentives in the system to follow a larger plan. So this government itself is not creating the incentives - the incentives are created by game theory, physics, and an underlying dynamics of the system that is facilitating - for instance a society - or that is facilitating the function of a brain. You will still have to look for food and social interaction in all these things. Consciousness is channeling the motivation that we have - it's not creating it. It's creating a model of where we are - this is what we experience as reality - and experience a model of what we should be doing. These are our purposes, but the motive power in these purposes comes from our underlying motivation that is outside of consciousness - that is older than consciousness itself. On the other hand we can see that basically all the mammals are conscious and that's also something that I was not that acutely aware of before I started looking, but it seems to be that apparent in the interaction between animals and also the animals and humans that there is a mutual awareness of the awareness of the other." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/rK7ux_JhHM4?t=8002)

> "Relevance realization is the name I give to a process which I argue is central to general intelligence. Your general intelligence is your capacity to solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains. For most of the problems you face the interrelated tasks of selecting what you are to pay attention to, what you are going to remember, and what you are going to do. The problem facing attention is that the amount of information available to you is astronomically vast. You have to ignore most of it, which is a lot of information. You cannot just arbitrarily guess what you should attend to nor can you methodically check all the information for that would take more time than your lifetime. There is a similar problem facing memory. Your long term memory stores a vast amount of knowledge, and the number of ways that information can be combined is astronomically vast. Similarly, all the possible sequences of actions which you could undertake is astronomically vast. Yet, moment by moment you are neither guessing nor methodically checking all the information, all your memory, or all the options for action. You are homing in on the relevant information while remembering the information relevant to your situation and selecting a relevant course of action. What is so impressive is how this is all obvious to you, and it is very often relevant to the context you are in and to the problem at hand. You can rely on the obviousness of your experience and that it is reliably sensitive to context. However, cognitive science has to explain how you generate such obviousness such that it is contextually sensitive to solving your problems. Saying that relevance is obvious or depends on context does not solve the problem because this merely renames the problem of relevance realization as the problem of generating a sense of the relevance of information in a contextually sensitive manner, and how do we do that? To say we learn it by experience is not helpful because to say we learn is to say that we zero in on relevant information in order to solve our problems. This learning cannot be arbitrary association nor can it use exhaustive examination of situations. Learning presupposes relevance realization and therefore cannot explain it. I currently have a paper under review, where my coauthors and I argue that relevance realization is probably convergent with the precision weighting at the core of predictive processing models. This convergence adds significant theoretical plausibility to the proposal that relevance realization is central to intelligence." - [John Vervaeke](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-summary-of-relevance-realization-according-to-John-Vervaeke)

> "You face a problem - in fact it's a meta problem whenever you're trying to do any problem solving - this is the following problem: the amount of information available to you is combinatorily explosive, it is vast, it is overwhelming. The amount of things you could pay attention to in this room - you could look at that spot right there, or that spot, or the relationship between the spots - you can do that, you're capable of it. When you think about it carefully now: the amount of ways you could look at this room and attend to it is combinatorially explosive. It is vast. The amount of information you have in your long-term memory and the possible combinations - it's huge. You could think of an aardvark, you could think of the Aztec empire, you could think of the beginning of the gold standard, and you could possibly even connect them all together. Think of all the ways you can connect all the things in your long-term memory. All the sequences of actions - I'm going to solve a problem - I'm going to start moving my body around, I can move this finger, then this finger could move these two, I could grab I could lift my hands, like oh I can sing - out of all the possible combinations you somehow zero in on the right thing to do, the right thing to pay attention to, and the right things to be remembering right now. You zero in on the relevant information and you ignore most - overwhelmingly most - of the irrelevant information. You frame your cognition and you pay attention only to what's within that frame and you ignore what's outside of that frame. It sounds paradoxical but this is the case - you're intelligent because of your capacity to ignore so much information." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=730)

> "When something is both highly integrated and highly differentiated it can do many different things without falling apart. So complexification enhances agency - it gives you your emergent abilities." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1250)

> "Now what we know unfortunately as true is that that intelligence - while so impressive - is only very weakly predictive of rationality. You take all the standard measures for intelligence - they all strongly predict each other - you take standard measures for rationality - this is the work of Stanovich and others - they all strongly predict each other, so two strong positive manifolds, but the measure for general intelligence and the measure for general rationality are only correlated at 0.3. Intelligence is necessary but nowhere near sufficient for rationality. Why is that? Because think about what I said: you're intelligent by ignoring most of the information. Remember my example of your interaction with the woman: sometimes the information you ignore is exactly the information you need to solve your problem. You realize that in a moment of insight, but the opposite is also constantly possible for you - you don't realize, you don't realize that you've misframed the situation - you're finding the wrong things salient you and therefore you're judging the wrong things to be relevant or important. And we live in a world that is exacerbating that - Harry Frankfurt called that bullshit and I don't mean to be offensive - that's the term of his famous essay. The liar cares about your concern for the truth and tells you something and tries to get you to believe it to be true because of your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist does something different - they try to make something salient to you and have you not care about whether it's true or false - all advertising works this way." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1390)

> "Across time, history, culture, environment - you see people coming up with sets of practices for ameliorating that self-deception and enhancing that cognitive fittedness. The name that's most usually used for those practices is wisdom. See, knowledge deals with ignorance, but wisdom deals with foolishness and those are not the same thing - you can be very intelligent and very foolish and there is no contradiction there at all." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1567)

> "We bashed out a consensus paper about what we think are the important features in wisdom. The dominant feature is perspectival metacognition. What does that mean? This is the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be able to shift perspectives. Shifting perspectives is one of the most powerful ways - I'm using my glasses like my mental frame - to get out of my mental framing. When I'm in a perspective what I typically can't see is the way the perspective is biasing me - I can't also take on interests and goals that are outside my perspective. But if I can take on his perspective or his perspective - that I can then look through them back on my perspective - I can actually overcome misframing. We depend on the dialogue between us to generate the multi-perspectival ability that can enhance the collective intelligence towards collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1621)

> "You can see the myths as enacting relevance realization on the collective intelligence of distributed cognition trying to educate us into wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1866)

> "I'm proposing to you that we should understand democracy as opponent processing within the collective intelligence of distributed cognition that is trying to self-organize that collective intelligence into a more proper orientation to the World." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1900)

> "But there are ways in which the collective intelligence can be subject to self-organizing foolishness - the bullshit can overwhelm us. And are we not now in a world in which the bullshit is overwhelming us more and more and more? How can the opponent processing of democracy degenerate? Well it can break down into polarization in which the emphasis on differentiation overtakes the opponent processing, or it can break down in group think, in echo chambers and bubbles that over emphasize the integration. We lose the complexification that allows us to deal with the complexity of the world and we stupefy ourselves into a kind of collective foolishness. When you have polarization the opponent processing breaks down into adversarial processing: one side is trying to destroy at all costs the other. And the problem with this of course is that debate depends on shared orientation - if we do not have a shared normativity we can't engage in debate. Groupthink also destroys the opponent processing because it reduces the multi-perspectival nature that is needed for collective wisdom - we're all thinking from the same perspective, we all have the same orientation. So either we don't have any orientation or we all have exactly the same one and the whole machinery breaks down." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1925)

> "I've been arguing at length that the West - whatever that is supposed to point to ultimately - is suffering from a meaning crisis or another way of understanding it is a wisdom famine. I will ask my students "Where do you go for information?" - they hold up the phone. "Where do you go for knowledge?" - science, the university. "Where do you go for wisdom?" - deafening silence. deadly silence. If our democracy is not educating us towards wisdom and alleviating the meaning crisis by understanding the embodied, enacted, embedded, extended nature of our cognition - it will not survive, because the meaning crisis - the wisdom famine - will overwhelm it. Debate presupposes a common unity, a community. It presupposes distributed cognition running collective intelligence that's being educated towards the wisdom of enhancing our connectedness, our meaning in the world. Without that, what we have is degenerate adversarial processing or echo chambering that is not addressing but in fact exacerbating the meaning crisis and the wisdom famine within propositional tyranny so all we have is endemic endless ideological warfare and the tsunami of bullshit that it generates. What is needed is a way of accessing collective intelligence and transforming it into collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=2272)

> Responses are much more prominent than on TikTok, which invites debate—there’s very little debate on TikTok, so it’s more a broadcasting site. But the debate on Twitter is very linear: all the responses to a tweet are nested into the first tweet, ranked mostly by recency, which doesn’t invite for thoughtful conversation, but rather fast conversation. You can’t have thoughtful and fast conversations at the same time, so conversations on Twitter tend to quickly descend into chaos.

> You have 3 ways of getting distribution on Twitter: through more Likes, Retweets, and Responses. Which means that different behaviors are incentivized. For Retweets, you want soundbites that people feel good about endorsing with their own identity. That is great to spur identity politics, for example. Lots of Responses also get your tweet distribution: another way to incentivize debate and polarization. Getting only likes is the weakest of the 3. Meanwhile, Likes don’t get you as much distribution. But Likes are by far the thing that people do most when they want to show compassion, for example.

We actually just have to re-engineer the way that we do things as a civilization to just be adaptive to the environment that we find ourselves in. I mean, that phrase should just be obvious, and then we just should look at the reality and say, “Okay, what are the environment we find ourselves in,” and then you start making the moves." - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/dE_orUarO_s?t=1105)

You’re always moving, right? Because the system’s always changing. Your basic choice is more of this and less of this. You’re constantly moving through an environment of up-regulating certain things and down-regulating certain things. Building an overall system, at the economic and at the sensing level, that has that kind of a characteristic to it, is the story. That’s the thing that we’ve got to figure out." - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/dE_orUarO_s?t=1612)

> "Imagine if you had a database that had everybody in it, and it had a mapping of all of their skills, and maybe a certain kind of psychological profile. It’s like the way they think. Then you also had some, the aforementioned sense that that group is sensing things, all right, so looking around and seeing stuff, and there was a way to escalate this sensing to the point where you could activate a much more intense investigation, right? It’s like, think of it, if you do a model, like the way that… You actually know this, because you built a software model of it, the way that the human brain actually runs attention, right? There’s peripheral attention, where you’re sort of paying attention broadly and diffusely to lots and lots of things. Then there’s a way for there to be a phase transition, where you actually give very focused attention. What was that? All right? You hear a crackle over there, and all of a sudden, the entire system allocates resources to pay very focused attention to that problem. Imagine if you had that, where you could actually have something where diffuse attention of our decentralized environment is orienting, orienting, orienting, and then, when a certain amount of energy is pointed to something, it pops, and you could then do… You push a button, and the right expert, the right people of competence around the problem domain, swarm to the problem domain. Maybe you get 30 distinct working groups that are all looking at it, and all of their outputs are put into a general location, so you actually get this… It’s a Bayesian distribution of distinct perspectives of these different working groups. By the way, I would imagine you’d actually probably want to iterate that two or three times, which is to say that you take the output of the first process, take all of that. Make that the input of an iterative process, where you have to deal with entirely new groups, or you scramble the groups. You actually have a really powerful model for actually shifting cognitive bias and group think and stuff like that. My guess is that you could probably build something like that, that could do two or three iterations, and not that long, like a period of a week, with 40 or 50 people. You could get to an 80th percentile of what our collective intelligence, what our capacity as a population, has to be able to make sense of that event, and at a very high level, like a radically higher level than we’re capable of right now. Here are all the important questions that we don’t know the answers to. If we want to ask them, we have to expand this thing, and so it’d be like a phase transition, from a diffuse environment to a very concentrated environment, which could then have another phase transition or de-escalation... Now that the larger system is now poised to really orient its attention, and now increasingly, as you say, at that point if my focused attention working group started throwing out signals that this is important, then my distributed actuation potential guys are going to take a look at that and say, “Oop, better pay attention now.” I’ve got my makers working on building masks. I’ve got… Hospitals are starting to gear up. That’s a mechanism that can actually have a nice feedback loop. I think the answer is yes. I don’t think it looks like Apollo, but I think we can take a lot of the learnings of what they did at an abstract level, and then say, “Okay, topologically, how can we actually replicate that, using contemporary tools to do something that is functionally equivalent to what they did, but is simultaneously able to use the whole of the population, is able to operate at light speed, and is able to do so in the context of an arbitrarily large number of possible threat domains.”" - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/dE_orUarO_s?t=1803)

> "Natural selection, this all-powerful driving force of biological evolution, has privileged in our genes traits that were immediately favorable to the survival and proliferation of our ancestors, under the conditions that prevailed there and then, with no regard for later consequences. This is intrinsic to the process of natural selection, which sees only the immediate present and does not foresee the future." - [Christian de Duve](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9467469-natural-selection-this-all-powerful-driving-force-of-biological-evolution-has), author of [Genetics of Original Sin: The Impact of Natural Selection on the Future of Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8111375-genetics-of-original-sin)

> "Focusing on the process of natural selection, de Duve explores the inordinate and now dangerous rise of humankind.  His explanation for this self-defeating success lies in the process of natural selection, which favors traits that are immediately useful, regardless of later consequences. Thus, the human genome determines such properties as tribal and group cohesion and collaboration and often fierce and irrational competition with and hostility toward other groups’ attributes that were once useful but now often ruinously dysfunctional. Christian de Duve suggests that these traits, imprinted into human nature by natural selection, may have been recognized by the writers of Genesis, thus inspiring the myth of original sin." - [Genetics of Original Sin: The Impact of Natural Selection on the Future of Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8111375-genetics-of-original-sin)

In the Hegelian dialectical process, sublation is the synthesis or integration of two opposing views (thesis and antithesis). The term "sublation" conveys a dual meaning: to both negate and preserve.

when someone does bad in terms of competence/accountability, in addition to a reputational penalty to them we could also penalize a bit those that gave their votes to that person - for empowering a rotten apple. We could also give rewards for delegating to the right person...?

Human potential is being squandered on a grand scale - why arent we investing the most so that the most disadvantaged rise the fastest? Such an altruistic act is the best way towards building trust

this is how we solve all types of alignment: AI alignment & human alignment

transparency builds trust and trust attracts customers. Customers of anything - aka humans want the truth despite their irrational psychological predispositions

labeling data needs rewards for correct labeling - an incentive for truth

what is a loss function? it is error correction. What's the loss function of the media landscape? what if we quantified it?

Jim Rutt Show EP #32: Jason Brennan on Irrational Democracy & Academia
epistocracy !!!
Problems with democracy and voters:
- people disinterested in politics - not voting at all
- very low understanding of what is going on
- systematic misinformation - not just ignorance - ppl get the facts wrong
- different responses to political questions even after just 1 week without anything having changed - random answers
- partisanship, tribalism & confirmation (& disconfirmation) bias
- ignorance, apathy, irrationality
- no skin in the game
- position bias (pick the first thing, pay less attention to anything other than the 1st page, etc.)
- likeability - superficial features of candidates
- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

In that view, you might think, “We should have democracy because it’s a way of civilizing and expressing the idea that all of us have equal value.”
>
> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people.

In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways.

In the words of the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth.

They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability.

we are justifying apes - we are not perfectly rational - far from it actually. We need to tame justification
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason
> "What reason does, rather, is help us justify our beliefs and actions to others, convince them through argumentation, and evaluate the justifications and arguments that others address to us. In other words, reason helps humans better exploit their uniquely rich social environment. This interactionist interpretation explains why reason may have evolved and how it fits with other cognitive mechanisms. It makes sense of strengths and weaknesses that have long puzzled philosophers and psychologists―why reason is biased in favor of what we already believe, why it may lead to terrible ideas and yet is indispensable to spreading good ones." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KRXjn7mFzN&rank=1#:~:text=What%20reason%20does,spreading%20good%20ones.)

> "Reason is flawed, but how badly? How should success or failure in reasoning be assessed? What are the mechanisms responsible? In spite of their often bitter disagreements, parties to these polemics have failed to question a basic dogma. All have taken for granted that the job of reasoning is to help individuals achieve greater knowledge and make better decisions. If you accept the dogma, then, yes, it is quite puzzling that reason should fall short of being impartial, objective, and logical. It is paradoxical that, quite commonly, reasoning should fail to bring people to agree and, even worse, that it should often exacerbate their differences. But why accept the dogma in the first place?" - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027487-reason-is-flawed-but-how-badly-how-should-success-or)

> "Whereas reason is commonly viewed as the use of logic, or at least some system of rules to expand and improve our knowledge and our decisions, we argue that reason is much more opportunistic and eclectic and is not bound to formal norms. The main role of logic in reasoning, we suggest, may well be a rhetorical one: logic helps simplify and schematize intuitive arguments, highlighting and often exaggerating their force. So, why did reason evolve? What does it provide, over and above what is provided by more ordinary forms of inference, that could have been of special value to humans and to humans alone? To answer, we adopt a much broader perspective. Reason, we argue, has two main functions: that of producing reasons for justifying oneself, and that of producing arguments to convince others. These two functions rely on the same kinds of reasons and are closely related." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027493-whereas-reason-is-commonly-viewed-as-the-use-of-logic)

Optimal common knowledge - only those that need to know about something know about it - perfect modulation of signal according to individual interests, as long as there’s no lying and manipulation, for which there are consequences

What if, just what if, we made an incentive for transparency, competence, and accountability? What would a civilization emerging from that look like?

We need an incentive to not want to harm others



The less fragmented the info space - the more eyeballs on whatever is public and more common knowledge - making lying harder

Open source corporations - with transparent democracy for any type of reward

Competing hive minds and how they merge gradually and adopt the better parts of others and how they might branch off and merge again later
Competing egregores

we can have AIs that do documentaries on any subject from multiple different points of view - perfect competition of partially overwrapping hiveminds

Even stock ownership in terms of options could be reduced a lot if the performance of their company under their rule mattered to their status, future employability and legacy?

the world we live in is the result of incentives. Change the incentives (aka bribe their cooperation and coordination and transparency with your attention - guaranteed business) - change the system within a single generation.

the real singularity is the shift to perfectly aligned incentives - after which all bets are off for what our civilization could achieve

as soon as some aspect that's been put to a vote changes suddenly in a drastic way one way or another - we could simply look at the top trending topics at that time to quickly gauge what this thing is all about

we need to build incentives for our own media system which disincentivizes lying and bribe a portion of the population to self-organize into the best at labeling certain kinds of data correctly

reducing the problem to a single place where it is discussed, but all other discussions simply point to it. every event/concept/data can be discussed and anywhere it is being mentioned - the epicenter of the discussion around it will be linked to - to browse through different viewpoints

self-manifesting error correction

an inverted panopticon
a reversed panopticon

at one layer of voting, we vote for which data/signal needs the most to be annotated propositionally - separately from the layer that does the actual work... what? :D

every conceivable question that makes sense should be expressable through a canonical form and be given a unique ID for reference

a system for stacking & compounding layers of transparent sensemaking

for anyone paying attention - there has been so much media bias against a company like Tesla since the start - egregious lying - as long as a civilization we have an incentive & media system that produces that we fail to get the best of the next generation and play most zero-sum games instead of striving towards optimality & cooperation

if you stubmle upon something which should obviously be tried because everyone wins if it works and the first to back it stand to profit - if you stumble upon such a thing - you try to make it work.

we need to allow any aspect of society to be able to evolve towards competence & results with the least amount of effort

how do we crowdsource & self-organize "proof of human"?

recursive self-reflection requires that any concept/entity/event has a single entry that can be referenced, and from then branch towards whatever else needs to be queried. unifying all concepts/entities/events under unique entries is a foundation for optimal recursive thought

Creating god would ensure we hatch from Earth as an egg and secure the existence of life for as long as possible

What if we bribed companies for donating as much as possible to our causes of choice and getting in return the market share of advertising - how much do we hear about them. This way if they want exposure they play by our rules - there is no more lobbying - this is crowdsourced lobbying

What if the currency of life is time - we all get more of it (UBI) one a month and get to redistribute it to whoever you think most deserves it. The ability to elevate what’s working properly. This should be our main source of status and competition - how much of this imaginary time-gifting currency one could get - because it literally translates us to having more authority and legitimacy

This is the “help us make sense of the world” network - this is the cooperation attractor - “help me, help you” https://youtu.be/B8NOJa2DwIs?t=5

These currencies would be the ATP for sustaining relevance 

Any competence vertical could have its own currency.

The ability to choose whether you’d check someone’s perspective based on their track record of playing according to the rules in good faith, combined with their competence

The whole ecosystem could have lower operating costs because a lot of work could be incentivised not with salaries but with status

We can reward for volume of work done or predictions made too

People can be gifted the competency currency or it could be collected as a bounty for a successfully completed public request

Epistemic currencies

This is how we get to the best human for any position that we needs to be filled

we need to deliberately improve our ability to prune big sections of the possible decision tree - improving our ability to realize what is relevant

they are exploiting our desire to connect - the ability to contact a person shouldn't also require you to go throgh an interface that tries to suck your time and hijack you. Connection and communication are hostage to an attention hijacking operation that's misaligned with humans

What if every button that would lead to an event creating action had a tiny color box in one of the corners showing the default visibility for this action, and with a hold we could get a popup to inspect it.

People compete for status in freemium games where whales spend tens of thousands of dollars to be recognised. We should channel this drive towards something productive

China can determine the type of content kids get through TikTok - what's our non-authoritarian solution to do the same? There is none.

how would we decentralize and crowdsource the banner with Covid-19 info that accompanied so much media?

being able to bookmark a search/filter query and treat that as a feed and have notifications for new entries

we need to incentivise being a moderator

we can participate in and direct our cultural programming

We need to aggregate expression

every "reviews" or "criticisms" section in wikipedia could (and should) be crowdsourced & computed with structured data

we can flag whataboutism

the foundation of social capital is a global identity protocol that can be permissionlessly extended

LLMs can help craft a propositional claim with structured data
^^ THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR HURDLE FOR THE ADOPTION OF A SEMANTIC WEB - THE INACCESIBILITY for normal people to express themselves in such a way and to consume such data. LLMs fix this.

We need a way to short a bad ideology, disprove it, and gain status from that in an objective way.

We can export stackexchange karma through some onboarding strategy

We can elect the arbiters of truth - the head of the pyramid for any problem


Any aspect of how we aggregate votes could be put to a vote - self-recursion

How much cheaper would be services to develop if they were done in the open and they got the help of contributors?
Closed source is a bug in software and the inability to export competence out of companies is a missed opportunity
Todo: crowdsourcing service development
“Hey if we solve this problem publicly make sure to use services that pay us a royalty for our discovery”

We need to make weighing signals profitable

The currencies of the 21st century aren’t linked to resources directly - there will simply be no transferability. Soulbound 
Daniel S. has been riffing on how to make something that is not fungible to resources.
Status as the soulbound currency.

The closer our model of the world to reality - the less suffering there will be and the less existential risk.

We can take control of the system by offering our attention - programming our relevance realization

There is a new game in town - parallel to resources - and we put other criteria on a pedestal and in the driver's seat

What if we feed the result of the collective intelligence into what the rules should be for a global currency and we started opting into it? And it could have privacy and ZK and whatnot

The meta crisis is solved only with alignment.

The root of power is sovereignty of identity

Wisdom is about decision pruning - it is about enhanced intelligence - relevance realization is intelligence

Synchronicity - conscious triggering of availability cascades around social & environmental issues as awareness campaigns

the ability to view only items that have not yet been viewed, or showing them differently in the UI

We need an alignment hierarchy to modulate signals - orchestrating/directing the attention of the world

We can publicly vote on how well someone did on a job

We need a way to ask any question about how to solve any problem and get the best result for that

We are an organism with a dysfunctional information system

Toggle between the views of different egregores

We need a unification mechanism

The only way to alignment is through transparency

We need to transparently crowdsource our management - using reputation and competence as signal

Crowdsourced “Should there be a law for X, and if so - what?” - always up to date and responsive to changes

We need to give every possible expression and idea a unique ID

why we need transparent money flows

Top 10 lists - choice ranking - is (collective) relevance realization

What if we could codify social norms & responsibilities - completely opt-in?
A way to calculate the degree of commitment to an egregore

What is education if not the conscious indoctrination of children into a set of norms and mental models?

Democracy 2.0 is computable

In order to merge our minds we need to give unique and shared addresses for entities

Social media has to be socially controlled

what if every science paper had to have its conclusions expressed with propositional logic?

We can have approved LLMs for tagging data and use zk-ml to prove that the specific model was used

Marrying responsibility with accountability

A toolkit for collective intelligence and information integration

Privacy zk and anonymity - the law of conservation - you can only spend your credibility once

Our civilisational kernel is an information architecture that can best enable alignment, optimisation and collective consciousness - information integration

Conscious pursuit of alignment is the most potent manifestations of conscious evolution

Why is curiosity good? Because it enhances focus

Wikipedia, but incentivised (with something other than a claim on resources) and multi-perspectival and complete - all knowledge, all events. All human history.

How do we give the best mental models in the most accessible way topologically sorted based on relevance and complexity to kids?

Universal basic status

Hey global brain, summarize 2023 for me amd play it in a 15 minute clip with the highlights

If we invent a mechanism that would eventually get us to the perfect and most fair state, then taxation should be of our biggest interest

Our number one goal should be to consciously choose how information propagates. The singularity is when life figures out that the only game in town is consciously optimising the flow of information

Teansparency is a precursor to alignment

What if we could use AI to generate media that would best let us feel what the global brain is seeing and thinking?

We could browse the global catalog of events, ask AI go give us summaries about any plane of inquiry

Imagine being able to ask “why are things the way they are” and you could get educated enough to understand any answer


We can vote on the score of companies and vote on what we’d want from them in exchange for a higher score. They use their score to better market their stuff for profit

We need a system of transparency to cannibalize a system of opacity

There isnt an organisation in the world that wouldn’t want to work with transparent companies where accountability and competency is rewarded

Today’s black box algorithmic feeds are mass narcissism and mental illness generators

The opposite of divide and conquer is integration

What if part of your status was calculated based on your positions in previous jobs

Imagine being a corporation that knows about this parallel information system and you dont want to join - WHY NOT ?!?! Are you hiding something?


What if we signal boosted people to be able to say what they want to be heard when they donate to charity, and depending on the amount?

!!! What would discord look like? !!!

The real singularity is when we integrate our information and our minds

What if propositional logic isn't necessary at all?

Good judgment is relevance realization

Attention and incentives are as fundamental as you can get

Feature extraction and pattern recognition

Recognition as a source of meaning

Why don't we let ourselves program our cultural norms?

In an ideal world with the best possible culture we would be doing X. We could never reach perfection, but how close could we get to it? 

Such a system would also incentivise more open source - not just from companies but also from separate individuals - this could be their CV for competence

What if you could browse what the world is trying to tell you - browse it any way you want as a young person?



Example for what people resort to because of a lack of top10 lists:
https://guzey.com/favorite/media/



Elon Musk has signal-boosted X accounts with problematic history numerous times - what if he could easily gauge their reputation from a few different angles instantly with a score?

Subsidiary/nested deployment of the same sensemaking/governance stack

The seeds of war are lies and misunderstanding and a lack of informational integration

Agency requires making models of the future with causal simulations
minimizing surprise when predicting the world

The forces behind cultural evolution should be transparent

Engagement farming is a disease because it is almost always irrelevant and/or inflaming/manipulative

Attention is the currency of consciousness

Reputation is the cure

Hoarding knowledge is inhumane

voting a certain way only if a threshold of such commitments by others is reached - like with SIMPOL

Objective reality just is. It's our job to integrate it and live according to nature’s laws.

what if I could allow myself to be influenced by someone without having to read every single text tweet by them? What if we could automate influence?

We need a system where we wouldnt be able to end up with malicious media bias towards a company like tesla

Transparent reputation tribunals

We need incentives to wire & integrate information

We need to address knowledge - giving a permanent and single ID to anything and be able to find it.

Status is a non-fungible currency - if you sell out you’d be destroying a lifetime of work


We need a competing signal to the money-on-money return paradigm

"The greatest fallacy of democracy is that everyone's opinion is worth the same." - Robert A. Heinlein

We need a distributed system that fact-checks the fact-checkers

Computing the rules-based order

We need to convert status-seeking through excessive consumption to recognition for contribution - we need to reward the contributors - the altruists

If we crowdsource the collective intelligence for every aspect of a problem along with their relations - well we have solved the problem

The moral offramp from GameA is to start contributing as much as possible

Universal basic rewards bundle - recognition - that can & should be given to others. Who do u recognise and for what?

What is a facebook group? Information and membership curation - a silo. We could have so many such different clubs with differing settings and customs and etc.

We need legitimate global trust

Integration presupposes consequence capture

We can use the top 10% of ranked accounts and use their voices with different weights depending on their ranking and we could vote on the constants for that vote

We need to make smear campaigns impossible

Imagine a mindset where you know the system isn't stacked against you but is actually maximally cooperative and trying to give you the tools to succeed - how much more meaning there would be

Imagine being able to reuse the same browsing architecture from the open web to your private files and data and notes - same data structures, algorithms and queryability

An alternative competition outlet - not money but status through knowledge and responsibility

The next Google is the infrastructure of the global brain

Giving data weight

The new incentive system for expertise

Imagine being able to explore how any part of the system works - and the ability of the system to generate the best possible explanation - specialized to you

Anonymous whistleblowing

The bit.ly of addressing in this world is woth just 2 numbers: acc_id/resource_id and the respurce_id can be also a string 

The nations that first jump ship will end up with the highest legitimacy and responsibility

How do we make intentional lying not a thing in media?

> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he)

The media and entrenched interests are guilty of crimes against humanity for their coverage of Tesla since its inception. It is an a-moral force that needs to be eradicated - corruption should be stopped

We will talk to the global brain through language

Alignment is a game theoretic arrangement - one predicated on transparency

The cure to the late-stage capitalism that is America is the evolution to the next level of the experiment - cooperative integration

Transparent crowdsourcing of the arbiter of truth

We need to make thinking from first principles the cultural norm

Game A is closed. Game B is open - the gates to power are open for the best of the best

The mind is a pattern-marching machine - it makes sense that we should want to pattern-match the most competent and responsible and put them in charge

The global brain is the most meta goal we could have - the one with the highest impact

The current system is a meme. What is our way of consciously evolving that meme? We arent conscious - nobody is in the driver’s seat - its a runaway freight train
Goliath is an emergent result of our system of systems

We need to see who is pushing for any meme - whats their history and what are their motivations



the great decoupling (material/resources/fungible currencies vs epistemic status)


Contributing a crucial piece of information (a missing piece from a puzzle) could be heavily incentivized, but accompanied by a much bigger penalty for supplying wrong information compared to applying the wrong tag to something. The reward can be delayed so that an agent cannot immediately profit from supplying false information in some time-sensitive arbitrage situations.

The Manhattan Project of integrating the superorganism's information.

What if society votes on how to redistribute some common pool of funds - either taxes or donations (that we can incentivise)?

Why not using wikiquote instead of these two other sources of quotes? Because the lack of a crowdsourced ranking - however imperfect

We should be able to introspect what are the kinds of people we’re allowing to guide us culturally - because we need mass cultural programming - always have been - but we need to put the right people in charge. How?

How do we reinvent TED - a curator for ideas worth spreading, but as a mechanism?

What if we could publicly have a conversation about what kind of movies we should have? This is meta-governance and we’ve left it out of our control

Manifesting science fiction

A crowdfunding campaign where the crowd funders get to decide who gets how much and get to vote publicly on which companies to fund and which builders to back and propose - in addition to the founding team. Let's crowdsource the vanguard of this ecosystem - a fund that owns a bit of everything

Quotes and their rankings are relevance realization - a very crude version of the collective’s vote

We need to become game designers - the choice of what culture we uplift is ours to make
What is our dopamine economy?

We need to make open source the norm rather than the exception - and push it further than mere code

The sign should read: "If you want power - go ahead and get it, but earn it legitimately"

We can run a parallel global democracy for years and when ready with the numbers and confidence of the new selects and the mechanisms we can switch the world within a 4 year election cycle

In small tribes we could express an opinion about anything and be heard - how do we express that some show on TV is bad for us?

How to do arbitrage in reputation markets? Signal that someone deserves more credit and them benefit for signalling that after the other person has proven themselves and their success is widely recognised. Same for the other way around
We need such arbitrage to exist in order to make the reputation “market” efficient

Prediction market vs futures market?
Futures market for reputations - and we should hire and listen to those that have higher future ranking - if people believe someone’s rank will go up - they are probably underrecognized now
And what about journalists and all other positions? How do we bet on people and win from betting right?




We need to end even just the possibility of nuclear war - what’s the plan?

Social legitimacy score

The global brain is a moral imperative

It is inconceivable why anyone would settle for anything less than futarchy

Causality all the way down

Global brain missionaries help people make sense of the world

Lets get the right kinds of people in the right structures of power

What if we all picked a problem to solve and worked in public?

If you can provably and reliably predict the second and third-order effects of policies and have superior modeling of the world - you should be in charge.

Why dont we crowdsource what we would like out of utopia?

Transparency and truth should be core values - more important than anything - the maximizers of fairness and cooperation. Incorruptability is the only game in town / worth playing. Evolution is telling us so

We need to make as many aspects of history computable as possible

Computation is a kind of memory - that is why we need to make history and reputation computable

We need to crowdsource truth and competence in every vertical of the economy and public service

Excellence, optimisation, and communality

Succumbing to endless growth expressed as consumption of resources should be a sin

How do we crowdsource the most resilient survival algorithm and then find the most compelling and accessible way to consume the story - on every level?

Why don't we crowdsource how we think children should be raised, and why?

What is the real economy?

Here we can express anything and have that actually matter instead of drowning in the void or irrelevance and inconsequality

What if different levels of reputation unlocked benefits that extend to the real world and to resources and consumption - like vacations? What if we could pool money (and nudge companies to donate) and then distribute those funds however we like?
STACK OVERFLOW BOUNTIES !!!
Some reputation systems go further, making it explicitly possible to spend reputation within the system to derive a benefit. For example, on the Stack Overflow community, reputation points can be spent on question "bounties" to incentivize other users to answer the question.

The Church ot Truth says that the more transparency and accountability and integration of information - the harder it is to lie.





Free will is a harmful concept - we need to focus more on the environment, systems and development and not put all of the responsibility on the individual
If we don’t aim at giving the best possible education to as many kids as possible - we are dooming humanity or at least exacerbating societal and survival problems in the future

addressing in computing: layer 1: at the OS level, layer 2: at the physical network level (internet, IP), layer 3: identity-based
personal computing, distributed computing, social computing

Dragging and dropping, freely rewiring data & functional nodes

everybody is an author, editor, publisher, critique, curator, librarian
everything you do you do for yourself, but you also organize the environment for others

what if regulation was cultural and not done through legislature?

learning in public - the best form of career progression

compounding is the root of all progress, but in today's world it's mostly expressed as monetary interest and knowledge and reputation to a much lesser extent. We've let claims on resources to dictate way too much - we need to tilt the scales

Meritocracy is computable and open-source

Uris: what if the 3rd and 4th number are all zeroes and that means that is a “named” resource that should be resolved differently?

Blocking someone doesn’t send them a signal that they’ve done something wrong - a public label that a comment was hateful does something else

The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Compound identity/reputation - like knowledge and interest
Reputation compounds just like knowledge and interest
> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he)
But compounding applies not only to interest but also to reputation and knowledge.

What if we could label squatters of names - taking up valuable names for speculation - and what if we could penalize them reputationally? Ala social regulation. Stigma.
Any kind of resource hoarding should be stigmatized - not enforced through regulation but simply culturally stigmatized.

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.
TODO: THINK ABOUT AVATAR
https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Consciousness_Transfer

How do we make sure we don't kill curiosity in kids? Make curiosity pay dividends - harness intelligence
We have generations of gamers - because there’s no alternative. We need to make God their playground and we would be the stewarts of it - generational transmission.

Democracy in its current form is captured - wake up

Crowdsource the question about self-driving cars - all aspects - give examples

Show how collective intelligence is beneficial

How much sugar should we eat? Crowdsource every such question!

What does having a pet cost the world? Why is the media pushing people to reconsider having a pet?

What does it mean to raise a kid - as a globally answered question? Girl? Boy? What's most relevant?

Crowdsourcing the global number of children policy as an opinion?

What is the role of an elite?

Not a carbon tax - an excessive comsumption tax. And without rliminating competition - simply adding another front for status competition that’s not tethered to natural resources

We need to make excessive spending more expensive - progressively

tagging and annotating is classification and organization of data. stigmergy!

the real change happened multiple generations after the invention of the printing press - we're still early with what's about to happen because of the internet

How do we shorten the time for the adoption and dissipation of new knowledge to everywhere it’s needed? Propagation speed is part of the integration puzzle

actions speak louder than words




most game-theoretic concerns are made obsolete through transparency
transparency and openness are post-game-theoretic

create Humanity's/the Global Brain's hierarchy of needs - what comes after Maslow

Ontology - nouns and verbs of your business - not just the data model (nouns), but also the actions that can happen (verbs)

We can shame the investment firms and banks that pressure food companies to increase their revenues at all costs (like putting more sugar in food)

Interpretability for the collective intelligence is solved from day 1 - it's the absolute opposite of a black box

How much value does open source generate? How many billions?

What if we could score people on how well they’ve covered all arguments and if they’ve covered all arguments at all or are extremely biased and missing the bigger picture?
If you give an opinion on one of the arguments of a debate - you should also give an opinion/weighting of importance to all the rest - otherwise your opinion would be classified as incomplete.

We are in the age of infinite leverage - we can change the system

HumanityOS

Presets like “only allow these accounts to contact me and notify me for only these types of events”

The only way to fix our problems is to get everyone on the same page

How do we rank our problems? How do we stigmatize and tax fast fashion?

Excessive/conspicuous consumption is immoral

The function of consciousness is to solve the frame problem - john V

Predictive processing needs precision weighting - prioritizing one set of signals over another

lying and misrepresentation of facts is costing the world tens of trillions per year by misallocating capital & labor

Our cutting-edge understanding of the world isn’t evenly distributed. It is in some fields to some degree, but it is hopelessly not true in others

The world runs on stories and there is no bigger story than this - unlike AGI, this is participatory

how do we express "I don't want fast food in my neightbourhood"?
What if you could ask an LLM "what does my neightbourhood want to change?"

Collective intelligence => collective sensemaking

Informational compulsive overconsumption & addiction
But all the books in the world wont make a difference if the tools are built in an exploitative way where we can’t set restraints for ourselves
Focus on addiction in the book
Countless books about dopamine and addiction
How do we counter indulgence?

A social network where your life gets better when you join - thats the goal.
Meaning, self-improvement, happiness, health and connection. What if you’re assigned to a random group of people who want to improve and are provided with guidelines from the most successful other groups?
Friendship matchmaking where you deliberately enter your goals initially
The religion thats not a religion - an ecology of practices - how do we foster that?

Use LLMs to contribute annotations and structured data and use LLMs to speak back at you what the aggregate thinks

Make a series titled “solving the meaning crisis”

How do we build de-escalation into the system?

What happens if you literally ask in tandem “what is most important” together with “why” over and over again - recursively?
Curiosity is the seed of intelligence - it needs to be nourished above all else

We can calculate at any point in time how far you are from consensus on any issue in this ever-changing complex world and we can choose how much to discount your views by

The only way to alignment is through transparency and interpretability
LLMs will be the global brain interpreters and narrators

Sovereignty for consciousness

Forget about utopia
“Optimal protopia”

Good judgment is relevance realization - good judgment is intelligence
It’s as obvious as hell

We can get everyone with an equal vote in stating our values and use a different weighting system for the competitive and cognitively demanding competition for intelligence - directed toward the benefit of all

What if we paid the highest possible price to elevate true virtue?

What if investigative journalism was of utmost prestige and such journalists wouldn’t need to sell their souls? How do we incentivize truth?

We don’t have just shared intentionality - we also have a shared fate.
This ^^ goes as theme 11
Our intent should be to steer that faith.

The deepest possible alignment & integration is the singularity

Anyone can join this network - and most will after even only one reading of this book - how could you object to this mechanism if you’re acting in good faith?

This is how we scale good faith - alignment comes through rewarding competitiveness for the good of the collective
Sex is the highest motivation - it is the root - monetary claims on resources are simply the old metric for maximization - we need to change our culture toward sustainability

This mechanism is like a disinfectant pill dropped into the oceans - any nation or region may opt-in to disinfect itself and earn legitimacy

Deep down we all want to be part of a unified humanity that fulfills its potential - a participatory culture that generates the best possible outcome.

We need to figure out our redistributive system - how do we all make it? Wagmi

Studying how you came to be (biology, evolution, life, physics) tells you where you need to go.

The market for truth will subsume the word
We need the invisible hand for truth (which is reputation coupled with transparency)

Consciousness can be beautiful - it can be a gift - and it should. Especially when the ride is shared: “hey! you witnessed that too, right?”
We don’t have just shared intentionality - we also have a shared fate.
Consciousness is a gift. How do we make a system where we could expand it?

We need to crowdsource censorship by leveraging collective intelligence and a truth market

How do we force companies to not waste any resources? Why would any company waste a perfectly good router and not reuse it when it is returned in perfect condition? This is parasitic behavior - it is maladaptive to humanity as a whole. Most such needless waste must be eliminated. How do we turn into a value and how do we force companies to do this?
https://www.techspot.com/news/85862-record-amount-e-waste-generated-2019.html

The older the problem - the older the solution. This is profound

It's all about sexual selection? Always has been
Money is about sexual selection - we need to make an alternative competitive field that's unconvertible to claims over resources


What if we could calculate drift - modern day "liberalism" is so far from what liberalism originally meant. We could track how much further communities drift from their original stated goals & values - a metric to think about.

an identity & addressing overlay for IPFS that fixes many of its problems

This whole book is an exercise of relevance realization. Ranking properly is the name of the game

Once reputation becomes the foundation for weighing data and recommendations - what happens to SEO? The only way to boost something would be to actually have a good reputation of delivering value

How do we express how we think our culture should change, and why?
Like how do we stigmatize wearing worn clothes?

How do we force people to use less plastic?

Think of this as the architecture of consciousness - and we’d be discussing it and improving upon it on itself - on the next plane of emergence - a place of higher order informational integration

The system ain’t perfect, folks… lets fix it
 
Transparency and openness fixed the problem with interviewing for jobs - all you have to do is simply to contribute somehow to the job - join their ranks in parallel and submit a few PRs and let them evaluate your work and decide if they would want to hire you. We need to make any kind of intellectual work possible through this system - a maximally open system

Every single aspect of this system should be dog fed to itself for further refinement, scrutiny and improvement - a self-referential system for governance

Many good people don’t want to stick their necks out in the current political and media environment. But what if the system was fixed such that only good-faith actors were elevated?

Seducing people to switch over to a richer and more multivariate world of status within a few generations

God is a mechanism and a direction. God is alignment. God is consequence capture. God is integrated information. God is connectedness. God is consciousness.

What kinds of literacy should everyone possess?

The level of education is positively correlated with confirmation bias - at least the current type of education

Money on money return is a feedback loop - how do we transition away from competing for claims over resources to a status-on-status return feedback loop?

You dont have to agree with everything proposed here - and thats the cool thing - you’d be able to push back against what you don’t like

What if web3 is not "the Internet of value" as in transactional value, but the internet of values?







Computed history/identity is important not only to gauge someone’s reputation and capabilities quickly once you stumble upon them but also for discovery. Currently, for discovery we need to hear in language from someone regarding someone else (and we also get an incomplete context)

Nature is telling us “hey you fools, before spewing out whatever comes to mind try to learn from prior art - there is nothing more art than nature

Strategy: let people help with the global brain - gaining reputation in return

Internet 2.0 is about values, knowledge, and alignment

We need to wake up after this multi-century intermission of purpose  

Attention is a resource - that's why we say "to pay attention"

What’s the “view source” analogy in this ecosystem?

It's all feedback within the mother of all complex adaptive systems called humanity

The current media environment is breaking many people and in different ways - some become completely dysfunctional

Reductionism vs complexity - the study of the dancer vs the dance

Multimatrix

fragment and conquer

Subreddits are a form of relevance realization

We need to scale trust beyond national borders - a single unified identity meta-network

God is compassion

> "I suspect that we can reconstruct the concept of God as an entirely rational concept, as a global optimum of transcendent (emergent collective) agency, affording a space of justifiable vantage points that allow judging between the available event trajectories." - [Joscha Bach](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1729067903457366325)

We can train AI for prediction of anything that we have already organised a prediction market about that thing with identity

Alignment is about reducing the friction of cooperation - we need a global trust network

Markets are for satisfying desires around scarcity
We need a market that can not be bought (buying your way in) simply with resources - the only way would be alignment and contribution

We can vote on how our taxes get spent - a market for public service instead of corruption
Anything less than a market for surfacing truth is suboptimal

God allows us to ask the question “What is my purpose” and then get an option along with a path for how to get there. You can get multiple options that are personalized to you

God is the search engine of meaning in life

The god of the 21st century is the most just of all

God is the planetary nervous system of humanity

(Sovereign) identity is the key to god

How do we publicly elevate those that we think deserve it?

We need to make intent public
The more transparent and better in predicting the world - the better

Existence can be cool. How do we increase the coolness and how do we gift it to as many consciousnesses as possible for perpetuity?

We all want to be loved - why do kids cry when they know they are being punished and disliked?

God is the fairness protocol

God is the purest form of cooperation - the most efficient one - achievable only with maximal alignment which requires trust through  transparency and reputation.

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

We’ve been sold to the highest bidder
How do we make it more costly to play against society? How do we remove parasitic behavior?

Corruption is a parasite and sunlight is the best disinfectant
The system is built on opaqueness and parasites hide in the dark

What should I do with my life?

God is leaving the world better after yourself

We need something that would sell itself

God is a story and we can choose him

God is an attractor - an aspiration. God is always further - there’s always more to improve. God delivers protopia - by terhering our values as the source of everything for meaning

God is the answer to meaning - god is what we create. God is what we contribute to - that’s god. The evolution of culture - the human spirit

The God inversion
God's inversion
The problem of the creator of God is solved once we decide to be his creators instead of being created by him
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_creator_of_God

Your choices of the rules you follow decide the fate of humanity - there’s a responsibility

What you propagate culturally is the ultimate purpose of life. Contribution to others.

The ultimate question is what should we teach our kids?

Raising kids should be all about teaching them alignment
That should be the core of generational transmission

The ultimate goal in life is to decide what to leave after you. You can make moral choices and leave a trace for others. Crowdsourcing “what is fair”

What does it mean to solve 

We have an expiration date. That should be the central focus of our lives - why are we here, what would we leave behind

What is the greatest story to be told? How do you leave a mark and have your life have meaning. How do we solve meaning?

Working in the gambling industry? Why?

The meaning, interdependence & service (not just services) economy

Compassionately winning the culture war

how do we replace scientific journals to curators with reputation and a funding mechanism?

The culmination of Darwin's discovery is the complete understanding and conscious application going forward of what nature has already discovered and given us on a plate - how to align agents into a collective for maximal benefit. We could complete this transition by 2059 (giving us 35 years - 1-2 generations to work with) - the 200th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species" by him.

"Is this good for me?" - how do I express that "Mr Beast" is 100% a waste of time to kids (if they they actually care about my opinion) - delivered through a relevance filter right next to the channel when viewing it or a video by it - a "context window"
What if successful kids could publicly signal what kind of media they avoid, so that other kids can make a conscious choice about where they want to take their lives going forward?

"give me the view of the world of the top 100 people according to a ruleset X, and if they don't have an opinion on something - inherit the opinion of whoever they've delegated expertise to (liquid democracy)"

strategy: dogfooding the system - piping every aspect of the vision through the collective sensemaking system as soon as possible and allowing for iteration on every aspect of it

Opinions on complex topics should be expressed as weights in argument maps

the relationship between the individual and the collective is the most important relationship

global governance vs global government

The evolution of the social contract & political philosophy didn't end with John Locke & John Stuart Mill & Rousseau & Thomas Hobbes

How do I signal that I want less sugar in my environment even though I will make such purchases when they are easy to make?

More examples: a feed for updates of friends & family, a feed for work, a feed for hobbies

There’s no reason to expect that an AGI will align humanity with itself - thats something we need to figure out on our own
We need to solve governance before AGI

Politicians have to constantly run photo ops and waste their time - because the way we elect them is the wrong way

Parallel media, economy & governance

Credentialed expression rights - we should demand that companies give us credentials for this new sensemaking & governance infrastructure

A post-scarcity world is one where scarcity doesn’t matter (is irrelevant) - not one where it doesn’t exist

Another collective action problem: the right to repair - should stigmatise companies for this

How do we make a system that would give you the best sequence of information/education so that you are your best self - mature, capable, playing to your unique strengths, self-actualised, rational and contributing? Capable of thinking critically, sovereign, capable of handling complexity?

The Liminal Web as the first target group for this project

Expertise from one sector is not translatable to another - unlike fungible money. Furthermore, experts in one field grossly overestimate their understanding of other fields (a cognitive bias). We should make it impossible for outside influence over a field - either by experts from other fields or by money - reputation and expertise are not fungible from one field to another

How do we let people take ownership & responsibility?

We need cultural enlightenment 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the counterculture of the 1960s
It should take over the world and even make religions irrelevant
The Counterculture of the 21st century
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture

We choose to build God not because it is easy but because it is necessary

I don't always want to have to watch your video or read your long text - just give me the TL;DR as a summary and let me choose if I want to consume the full piece to be convinced
^^ this is in conflict with the influencer's (or curator's) incentives to some degree, but the best ones that are trusted by millions will still generate enough revenue from the long-form content

Convergence gives us trustworthiness - the opposite of bullshit

“If it bleeds - it leads” - as a chapter name about media

“Contribution to humanity rank/index” for companies - making yet another kind of shampoo or a snack doesn’t get you high in there - just like vulture funds and the reputational damage that comes along from working at one

How do we short aspects of culture?

The ultimate product is the ultimate system which is responsible for every other product
The purest manifestation of “give people what they want”
Naval quote go big because we all go home

Dad - what did you do - fucking legend meme - I helped revitalize civilization and make it multi-planetary

People can express their views and also their reasoning/reasons - we might only count votes that have also given a reason and we might even require that people have seen the reasoning proposed by others and to have acknowledged it and given those reasons also a weight relative to their own reasons

A separate feed with the truffle pigs - select a few high-grade curators and let their picks show up in your “top 10 daily feed” - no infinite scroll

We need knobs for viscosity - how many replies by a single person per day, how much time before being able to change your vote

If you repeatedly reshare things that turn put to be wrong - you should get progressively penalised somehow
Endorsing and amplifying something should have consequences and is a moral choice - its your public duty to think before you act

2 sets of 5-star ratings: quality and importance

We need to engineer for emergence within a complex system - not constrain it
A lot of information are held in the dynamics of a system - not in the statics - the flows
You can turn off and on a complicated thing (a car) but not your body or an economy
Theory-practice-theory loop - not everything will work

How do we introduce market dynamics within institutions?

Twitter and modern day algos & ephemerality are incentivising throwaway engagement farming

Retrospective time well spent - ask people once a month how they rank their past activity - to tune the system

We have a global economy and local governance - that’s a mismatch
We need to regulate the balance between competition and cooperation
The neo-liberal economic order needs to be replaced

What if we could add a cost to politicians if they can’t reach an agreement?

If we’re operating into a self-organising meritocratic & alignment structure - wouldn’t an AGI be more likely to simply tag along with us within this most powerful cooperation structure? Isn’t biology the ultimate self-assembling & recycling substrate for within the environment? The ultimate closed materials loop (barring energy from the sun)?

Fork in the road meme: evil gameA vs solving the metacrisis

If everything is out in the open - people will be more engaged and less disenfranchised

Nietzchie’s madman proclaimed the death of god - now the time for nation states has come.

How do we conserve energy? How do we make it fashionable and into the consciousness/awareness of everyone? What are the lifestyle changes that are necessary?


The large expansion of our brains was to make us cultural acquisition machines - we’ve evolved to be particularly good at acquiring, storing, and organizing cultural information

Any claim can be put on two scales: certainty/likelihood and importance. That's what we need to figure out - a topological sortition of RR

We can have a license that allows only other companies within this ecosystem to use our stuff - representing a barrier/membrane between gameA and gameB

Embrace infinity in every conceivable way

Enculturation architecture

“Don't look up” is a diagnosis

Our hobby should be problem-solving

Constraints are freedom

List an incredible amount of things and accomplishments and needless deaths that would simply have not mattered if we fail in this transition - not trillions or quadrillions - an infinite number of causes and effects and events and signals and aspirations and gestures 
The worst thing in the universe is irrelevance - inconsequentiality - pure meaninglessness

We used to sing and dance around the fire

The extent to which we shift to frugality is the extent to which catastrophic risks will be minimized

We need to purge everything dysfunctional - we need to puke it before it's too late

The ultimate litmus test is prediction

We’ve put the self on a pedestal 

Just like life, the internet also evolved blindly and unconsciously - gradient descent. But we are architects and can consciously choose our civilizational foundation

If you care about something you should express it publicly

Learning should be a joy - an honor

Nature is counting on the next generation to step up to the challenge or fade into irrelevance

Intelligence didn’t evolve to not be taken seriously

We should be terrified by our capacity for self-hate and we should channel that energy toward improvement

Laissez-faire capitalism needs to end

We can fail nature - we’ve surpassed it but have not fully learned from it

We’ve not fully integrated everything nature has to tell us

It is disrespectful to nature to not learn from it - nature is the embodiment of wisdom

We're in a free for all and that should scare everybody

A civilization and culture before us built the pyramids - what’s our legacy?
We should build the biggest pyramid by 2100

Napravi video v koeto pravish nqkakvo kalpavo kulbo i sped tova se izpravqsh indirektno zapochvash da govorish za vuzmojno nai-golqmata ideq v sveta - sincere irony?

Our votes lead to governments whose laws are public for anyone to see - why not do the same for voting?

DGC - destructive global competition



The invisible hand has no competition - it’s left unchecked and is ripping meaning and morals out of our civilization. If you truly care about competition we should introduce it at the most fundamental level and give rise to another invisible hand that’s not fungible to material possessions but is all about the meaning of life and recognition by and connection to others.
We need a meta-invisible hand that will tune the relationship and distribution of money (claims over resources) and human values

When tracking portfolio success - ppl will initially define the parameters & risk against which they should be judged - aiming for 100x vs minimizing downside

We are locked into an individualistic multi-polar trap of conspicuous consumption

There is no accountability without accounting. In business and finance accounting is about money. In the status, purpose, and meaning world accounting is about reputation.

> "Culture is the collective arena at the cognitive level on how we distribute challenges and do proper problem formulation." - [Tim Bishop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2oqxo_wHr0)

You don’t want what's relevant to you to be determined by people who are not aligned with you

An open-source economy

Expression is a primordial desire and need

We can publicly rate our happiness and then we can query what the happiest people do. Same for success, fulfillment, people dealing with death anxiety, terminal illnesses, etc.
Imagine being able to ask “what do others think” for every stage and situation of your life

Top10 desires: decriminalize psychedelics

This is a fight for conscious life itself
The fight of our lives

Ritualised suffering

Give and ye shall receive

Enlightenment 1.0 killed god and the 2.0 version needs to reinvent him
Quote god is waiting at the bottom of the glass

We have to incentivise contribution to the common good and we have to decouple that from resources - we need a new incentive

Every dysfunctional individual is a tragedy and a symptom of our dysfunctional culture
But what is a functional individual? Let's inspect a debate map

Trying is not good enough

Meritocracy is the last revolution to be had

We are at an evolutionary choke point and the only way through it is through a conscious strategy which will be implemented and carried forward through governance

Many people hate profit - they misunderstand capitalism, incentives & human nature

Relevance realization is the most important mental mode

Write as you are addressing kids - tell them about the word they’re about to inherit and what they could do to influence its direction

This is for the teenagers - those that are still neuroplastic
Most people die at 25-30 because they stop developing

> "What is needed to make this immense sensing, valuing, and acting capability available for intelligence is to interconnect these people and tools via a vast and powerful network. That network too already exists, in the form of the Internet: any information collected or decision made by any human or technological agent(s) can in principle be transmitted nearly instantaneously to any other agent(s) for further processing and/or enacting. The amount of information propagating across this global network is many orders of magnitude larger than the most powerful channel we could envisage to feed a single AI, however advanced its processing capacity." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf)

> "Just like the neural networks in our brain, the global network processes this information in a distributed manner, with billions of human and technological “neurons” working in parallel—on partly the same, partly different data—while aggregating their results into collective decisions and  actions. Unlike the centralized, tightly controlled systems imagined by AI theorists, this network functions like a complex adaptive system: a decentralized, selforganizing whole formed by an immense variety of interacting agents. This makes the overall system much more powerful, robust, and adaptive than a preprogrammed central processor that takes in information sequentially. As it adapts, this network learns from its experience by expanding and extending the most useful technologies, ideas, links, institutions, and agents, while setting aside and eventually forgetting the less useful ones. Moreover, it learns to ever better coordinate the activities of its components, by creating ever more direct and more powerful links between them. It thus increases its own intelligence. This increase can only accelerate as a more powerful and intelligent network also expands and develops more quickly." - [Return to Eden?

The basis of its success is [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a mechanism of self-organizing coordination between independent agents. The principle is that the work of one individual (e.g. an edit of a Wikipedia text) leaves a public trace (e.g. a change in the corresponding web page) that can stimulate one or more other individuals to continue the work (e.g. add further details or correct wrong assumptions). Thus, independent contributions build further the one on top of the other, producing a collective result much richer and more complex than could have been achieved via any traditional, centralized form of organization.

> "An essential part of that knowledge will be about the superorganism as a whole: how does the world function, and what opportunities and dangers can we anticipate? This requires, first, a general, transdisciplinary theory of complex systems and their networks of interactions: a global systems science. This theory would then be implemented as a living earth simulator: a comprehensive computer model of global society, the planetary ecosystem, and the way they interact. Such a simulation would allow us to anticipate the effects of different events or interventions on the global superorganism. That would make it possible to formulate a nearly optimal trajectory for global development, while as much as possible steering clear of conceivable obstacles, catastrophes, and negative side effects. However, in order to remain up to date and to adapt to unforeseen disturbances, this model would need to be constantly fed with new data.

These are “Human Metasystem Transitions” (HMST). Throughout these HMST several common system-level patterns have manifested that are fundamental to understanding the nature and evolution of the human system, as well as our potential future development. First, HMST have been built around the control of three mostly distinct primary energy sources (e.g., hunting, agriculture, industry). Second, the control of new energy sources has always been achieved and stabilized by utilizing the evolutionary emergence of a more powerful information-processing medium (e.g., language, writing, printing press)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

The highest metasystem controls display an ever-broader extension of control over larger regions of space, and they can accomplish this spatial feat in shorter durations of time (i.e., physical space-time barriers to human action are consistently and progressively reduced). Consequently, there is a trend toward accelerated metasystem emergence, as the space-time reach of human action progressively increases. The hunting transition occurred over a period of hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, the agricultural transition occurred over a period of thousands of years, and the industrial transition has been occurring over a period of centuries. This metasystem process has resulted in more complex human organizations directly and coherently controlling more of the Earth’s surface, faster. For individuals, the consequence is the emergence of systems that increasingly allow for action that is global (spatial) and instant (temporal). Therefore, in regards to both space and time, higher metasystem controls appear to facilitate a culturally and technologically mediated conquest of dimensionality." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

It is intuitively obvious that if subsystems collaborate systematically in achieving a goal, they will be more effective than if they would behave anarchistically, without plan or co-ordination. The presently fashionable argument that no overarching plan is needed, since interacting actors will self-organize into stable and efficient patterns of interaction (the “invisible hand” of market forces), does not invalidate this proposition. The spontaneous ordering of a market is the result of complex communications and negotiations that lead to an overall co-ordination and constraint of the different actors’ behaviors. Once a perfectly competitive market has reached equilibrium, no participating actor is able to set prices that significantly diverge from those resulting from supply and demand requirements without being eliminated from the scene (“going broke”). One can debate whether the resulting economic order controls the actions of the participating actors, but it certainly constrains them." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

This can be explained by assuming shared controls additional to the genetic one. Though we will discuss different types of control mechanisms in a later section, the most typically human mechanism can be found in culture: knowledge or beliefs shared between individuals through communication. A belief, piece of knowledge or pattern of behavior that is transmitted from one individual to another one can be said to replicate. In analogy to genes, such cultural replicators can be called "memes"." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "The most productive way to cooperate entails division of labor, each individual focusing on a different subtask while contributing to a common goal. Such independent action is not only easier because it requires less coordination and exchange of information, it is potentially also much more productive because of synergetic complementarity. If different individuals focus on gathering different resources, they will not only be able to avoid the fitness reducing effects of direct competition and arms races, they may even be able to directly enhance each other's fitness by exchanging surplus resources, like in the symbiotic relationship between alga and fungus. For example, in primitive tribes, one part of the population might focus on gathering fruit, while another part might focus on hunting. This will allow each of the two subgroups to develop greater expertise in their domain of specialization, and thus greater efficiency in collecting resources. The more differentiated the specialization becomes, the larger the domain of resources that can be explored by the collective." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

However, the development of a shared control, which restricts independent evolution on the individual level, provides a possible mechanism for overcoming this obstacle. Once some type of control is established, differentiation of roles within the social system is facilitated. In accordance with Turchin's "law of the branching growth of the penultimate level", increasing differentiation increases the selective pressure for developing social controls, which in turn feed back into increasing differentiation.

At each level, there is not only competition between other groupings at the same level, but also competition between the interests of the smaller incorporated units and the interests of the larger encompassing unit. Primary, face-to-face, groups are incorporated into organized city-states, and these into nations. A plausible node of selection and inter-organization competition can be envisaged at each of these levels. Our skepticism towards Turchin's prediction about the inevitable organizing of nations into a single world government comes from the lack of any obvious node of selection at the whole-world, multinational level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

The solution was to limit group selection to non-biological cultural evolution and to see self-sacrificial altruism as a result of cultural group selection of ideologies, social-organizational traditions, moral indoctrination, and religious cosmologies. This point of view had many plausible implications, among them an explanation of why moral commandments and lists of deadly sins contain explicit rejections of innate human nature. There is also the obvious group-coordination utility of beliefs in rewarding and punishing afterlives and reincarnations, which extend perceived self-interest into an afterlife and thus can promote self-sacrificial acts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

If they are not convinced by the ever repeated messages transmitted by the other members of the group, the other members can simply force them to obey the rules, by punishing them as soon as a transgression is witnessed. This is a form of mutual monitoring. It implements the reciprocity of cooperation that is also found in "tit-for-tat"-like strategies. Conformist transmission and mutual monitoring together produce a sufficiently strong shared control to allow the evolution of extensive cooperation in small groups with close contacts: primary or "face-to-face-groups". However, when groups become so large that not all members are in direct contact with each other, it becomes difficult to maintain an overall shared control. Without reciprocal monitoring, deviant behaviors get a chance to develop. This can be controlled by two additional mechanisms: 1) by making the belief so strong that it controls behavior even in the absence of other group members reinforcing it (internalized restraint); 2) by developing specialized subgroups (e.g. police, militia, the judiciary) whose task it is to monitor and enforce the following of rules (legal control)." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

From the different social control mechanisms it is the one that most strongly resembles the traditional concept of control as exerted by a separate, centralized, hierarchically superior system, that tries to reach an explicitly formulated goal by rewarding actions that contribute to reaching that goal, while punishing those that produce deviations. As a pure form, without mutual monitoring and internalized restraint, legal control requires an unaffordably large specialist corps to enforce it: you cannot put a policeman next to every citizen." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

But law in its effort to achieve universality and fairness must pretend that words have situation-free, formal meanings, denying their indexicality. Written and interpreted 'literally', the wordings allow loopholes and unintended uses never envisaged in their construction. The result is that in modern states, such as the present-day USA, enormous amounts of money and effort are invested in lawyers and legal research, just in order to try to interpret the rules in one's proper interest. The only possible countermeasure seems to consist in making legal formulations ever more formal, precise and explicit, anticipating ever wider ranges of particular conditions. The net result is that law seems to get ever more complex and difficult to manage." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "A fourth type of social control, market mechanisms, can again to some degree compensate the shortcomings of legal control, internal restraint and mutual monitoring. In market processes the intelligently selfish choices of all group members together curb the greed of single individuals, by making it unprofitable to ask for more than a "fair share". Similar to mutual monitoring, market mechanisms operate locally. This means they do not require an independent, centralized control organ, like legal control does. This makes them more tolerant and flexible, adapting quickly to new contexts or developments, but less reliable, and more prone to vicious cycles induced by small variations magnified by positive feedback ("boom and bust").
>
> Market mechanisms are quite efficient in the allocation of the factors of production (natural resources, labor, capital). Their main function is to regulate the diversification of effort resulting from division of labor. Markets create an equilibrium between supply and demand of goods or resources by adjusting prices (which are a consensual measure for the average value of a good). This ensures that when a particular good or service is in demand, there will quickly develop a sufficiently large group of individuals or firms specialised in providing it to meet that demand. Complementarily, when demand diminishes or supply increases (e.g. because of more efficient technologies), the effort invested in providing these goods will be quickly adjusted downwards, making more effort available for meeting other needs.
>
> The general mechanism is a negative feedback cycle where increase in supply via decrease in demand produces again a decrease in supply. Thus, large fluctuations are damped, and prices tend to stay around an equilibrium value. Although the negative feedback loop is the basis for cybernetic control, it is not sufficient on its own to create a control system. As Powers (1973) notes, cybernetic control requires amplification of the corrective reaction with respect to the initial perturbation: an increase in supply/demand above the reference level should produce a counteraction decreasing supply/demand more quickly than the initial deviation. Such a system very soon reaches a fixed reference or equilibrium state, from which it is very difficult to make it deviate. Market feedback, on the other hand, tends to be smaller than the fluctuation that caused it: after the demand goes up, it will go down again, but in general not so much as to reach its original level. Thus, the "equilibrium" value will slowly move, adjusting to outside conditions, which depend on the availability of resources, and the intrinsic needs of the public. It is this absence of an explicit norm or reference value that distinguishes market "control" from the other social control mechanisms, where religious values, moral and social rules, and laws provide the fixed reference against which behavior is evaluated. The variability of market feedback allows adaptation to new circumstances while still buffering the system against wild fluctuations.
>
> However, the concurrent danger is that when there is no stable underlying need or fixed store of exhaustible resources, feedback may become positive, leading to run-away processes. A traditional example is speculation, where an increasing demand makes people anticipate even higher prices, and thus gains for goods or assets bought now and sold later. Another example is technological development, where increased adoption of an innovative technological product (say an airplane or computer system) diminishes the costs needed to produce further units, and encourages the public to use that technology, rather than less well-spread competing designs. Thus, increase of supply leads to both further increases of supply and increases of demand ("increasing returns", see Arthur, 1988).
>
> Libertarian theorists and [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) economists recommend using market mechanisms as the overall control, while avoiding all centralized interventions except for the protection of private property and inherited wealth. Yet, we believe that market mechanisms cannot operate effectively without the contribution of the other social control mechanisms. The building block of market processes is the transaction, in which one good or service is traded for another one (or its proxy, money). A transaction is basically a "Prisoner's Dilemma" type of interaction, in which there is a short term benefit in defecting, i.e. profiting from the other party's investment without fulfilling one's own part of the deal. (For example one might refuse to pay for a service, or pay with counterfeited bank notes, or supply a defective good). It is just to counteract such tendency to defection that mutual monitoring, internal restraint and legal control have evolved. In particular, legal control is needed to ensure that contracts are fulfilled, and that goods are not captured through violence rather than trade. On a different level, legal control is necessary to ensure that positive feedback loops do not get out of hand, and that investments are made in areas where the lack of local or short term benefits precludes private investment.
>
> In a similar vein, Mancur Olson (1968) employs the tools of mainstream economics which are characterized by the hope that an "invisible hand" emerging from competition will provide the restraints needed for collective action. But he shows that from basic economic assumptions it follows that if each person is intelligently selfish in choices, "collective goods", including the benefits of cooperation, will be lost. (This agrees with Hardin's (1968) analysis of the “Tragedy of the Commons”, where competition exhausts the common resources.) He concludes that to solve "free-rider" problems some form of compulsion is needed.
>
> As an additional argument, we may remember that competition between similar systems tends to lead to arms races which decrease absolute fitness. For example, two companies producing essentially similar products (e.g. soft drinks) by similar methods and selling them for similar prices can only hope to increase their market share by spending more and more on publicity. This may lead to situations where more than half of the product's price is made up by the cost of advertisements, trying to convince the customer that one's product is better than the competitor's product. Market competition will in general only produce a positive sum if there is a differentiation in resource usage and production methods between the competitors, but, as we discussed, when the initial differences are too small, competition will hinder rather than stimulate further differentiation. E.g. when a particular way of producing soft drinks is well established it is quite risky for an existing company to distinguish itself from its competitors by promoting a new recipe: the chances are higher that it will lose customers used to a particular taste than that it will make new converts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "A complex society like ours, characterized by a full division of labor, seems to require the presence of at least the four social control mechanisms outlined above. Each of these mechanisms functions at a different level of interaction. Internal restraint functions at the level of the single individual. Mutual monitoring functions between pairs (one to one) or small groups. Legal control is directed from an individual or small group to the whole (one to many)—and, if the controlling body is democratically elected, the other way around (many to one). Market equilibria emerge from interactions between all members of the group (many to many).
>
> Of these, only legal control can (arguably) be fitted into the classical, hierarchical control paradigm. This may explain Powers’s (1980) reluctance to recognize any kind of control at the social level. Yet, all these control mechanisms can be viewed as social constraints, curbing and modifying the selfish and nepotistic goals that control individual actions. They are thus working at the metasystem level (as defined in Heylighen, this issue).
>
> In spite of their sometimes wide-ranging and subtle effects it is obvious that the mixture of control mechanisms we see in our present society is far from optimal. What is most obviously lacking is any form of integration between these mechanisms. It is easy to imagine situations where the restrictions imposed by the different mechanisms are mutually inconsistent, religious tradition demanding one type of behavior, law another one, the market a third one, and peer pressure a fourth one. Moreover, each control mechanism on its own lacks an invariant focus: mutual monitoring varies with the local group of peers, legal control and internal restraint with national, organizational and religious frameworks, and market pressure with the vagaries of interacting positive and negative feedbacks, as exemplified by the chaotic movements of quotations at the stock exchange. Thus, in spite of the metalevel at which these mechanisms function it is as yet hard to recognize in society any integrated metasystem. The task of thinking through the problems of social control that are created by the on-going competition between the cooperators is merely starting." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

In considering the episodes of scientific fraud that have come to light in recent years, face-to-face-group solidarity processes are relevant in two ways. On the one hand, they explain the cruel ostracism that whistle-blowers experience when they call attention to defects that would undermine "truth," organizational goals, or national goals. On the other hand, most discoveries of fraud are due to the mutual monitoring of fellow workers in the face-to- face laboratories. A sociology of scientific validity might recommend both increased opportunity for mutual monitoring in laboratories, and a restructuring of perceived legitimacy so that whistle-blowing (or an earlier-stage substitute for it) was not stigmatized as disloyalty or interpersonal hostility, but rather routinized as always required minority reports." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Evolution, both cultural and biological, has produced organization-optimizing (group-solidarity) mechanisms which are optimal in intergroup conflict and hence work against whole-world organizational optimizing. LeVine and Campbell found that Sumner's principle, "the exigencies of war with outsiders are what make peace inside" or "real threat causes ingroup solidarity," was the most frequently endorsed or independently invented of all of the principles of intergroup conflict. If there is a "facultative polymorphism" for group vs. individual optimization, the threat of outgroup aggression is no doubt a powerful stimulus for group-optimizing behaviors. Such perceptions are open to manipulation by insecure national leaders and by their competitors for leadership, and such maneuvers are chronic saboteurs of intergroup peace. In proposing novel political arrangements, here is perhaps the greatest need for new arrangements and legitimacies. Perhaps the route could be through popular education as to these self-destructive mechanisms, plus a plausible design for world government which could offer the hope of righting injustices without war, plus a strong appeal to the motives of individual well-being and inclusive fitness done in such a manner as to not disrupt social coordination at sub-national levels of organization.

> "The eternal problem is that all groups, at all levels, will demonstrate some form of "clique selfishness". This applies over the whole spectrum, from the smallest units, families (that are strongly tied up by the genetically induced tendency to nepotism) and face-to-face groups (e.g. colleagues working in the same office space), to the largest (e.g. nations or groups of nations, such as the European Union, and the overarching religions or ideologies, such as the group of all Muslims). The fact that all these different fuzzily defined groups are nested or overlapping creates an extremely complicated picture, in which the same two individuals will either compete or cooperate, depending on the level at which their interaction takes places. This makes it extremely difficult to predict the further evolution of a complex society such as ours.

> The strongest influence for the future is perhaps the emergence of ever more powerful and better integrated communication media, as exemplified by the explosive development of electronic networks such as the World-Wide Web. This makes it in principle possible for fit beliefs (memes) to spread quickly over the entire globe with minimal distortion. If beneficial beliefs thus manage to get shared world-wide, they may initialize a global pattern of cooperation. More specialized global control knowledge may similarly be developed and maintained within an overarching computer network (Heylighen, 1996), whose ubiquitousness, flexibility and intrinsic intelligence may be able to overcome the rigidities of bureaucratic organization and legal control, and the short-sightedness of market mechanisms. Nobody can predict how, when, or even whether, such global integration will take place. The only thing we can safely predict is that the various forces of individual and group selfishness will provide formidable obstacles, leading to major conflicts, on the road to world-wide cooperation." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "A "social" MST can be seen as the emergence of an integrated, controlled supersystem out of similar, but initially independent control systems ("individuals"). It thus differs from others MST's discussed by Turchin, such as the emergence of movement, learning or rational thought, where the systems to be integrated (neurons, muscles, cognitive patterns, ...) either are not similar or are already dependent on an integrated organism. This difference is what makes social MST's problematic. We have seen that since individuals share common resources, yet independently maximize their outcomes, they tend to get engaged in negative sum competition. Positive sum, cooperative arrangements, which optimize the fitness of the group as a whole, normally get eroded by this competition. Thus, the part-whole competition between groups and individuals tends to be won by the individual level. A social metasystem would overcome this negative sum development by simultaneously differentiating individual's roles (division of labor), and restraining their selfish optimizing (social control), thus creating the conditions for positive sum synergy. However, a necessary condition for such metasystem to evolve is a shift from selection of individuals to selection of groups. We have discussed one mechanism that makes this possible: the development of controls (genetic or learned) that are shared between members of a group. Shared genetic controls are characteristic of the cells in an organism and the individual insects in an ant's nest or beehive. They thus may explain the well-integrated social metasystems found in multicellular organisms and insect societies.
>
> In human societies, on the other hand, competition at the genetic level continues, though group selection may have developed a genetic basis for certain innate social control mechanisms, like reciprocal altruism and moralistic aggression. This makes humans into profoundly ambivalent social animals. The predominant shared control for humans is cultural: beliefs spread through conformist transmission. However, the conformist mechanisms that keep beliefs similar are not sufficiently strong to keep context-dependence and communicative degradation from producing a continuous belief divergence or "memetic drift". Thus, human society becomes a patchwork of fuzzily defined groups at different levels of aggregation, characterized by clique selfishness and hostility towards competing groups. Different control mechanisms have evolved to complement the limited internalized restraint produced by shared beliefs: mutual monitoring, legal control and market mechanisms. However, each of these mechanisms has its intrinsic shortcomings, and as a whole they are characterized by inconsistency and lack of integration. Though there certainly exist methods and tools that may make social organization more effective, which must be examined urgently, we as yet do not see a straightforward path to social integration at the world level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "The main applications of the Internet are likely to become integrated into a single, universal system for coordinating all the activities of the people and machines on this planet. Such a system would immensely reduce the confusion, friction and waste caused by poorly aligned activities, while boosting the synergy of collaboration. Complemented by on-going technological innovation, the resulting increase in productivity would create an economy of abundance, where all needs can be satisfied at negligible costs. The combination of abundance with an intelligent, bottom-up system of coordination should eventually produce a solution for all the major problems that plague humanity, including global warming, poverty, inequality and conflict. This utopian but realizable scenario for the mid-term future has been called “return to Eden”." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Society is an autonomous system: it is able to survive and grow by solving the problems or exploiting the opportunities that it encounters—and this without need for outside direction. It recognizes such challenges through its (largely implicit) value system, which evaluates certain conditions as beneficial (e.g. education, shelter, drinkable water, peace, …) and others as harmful (e.g. hurricanes, pollution, crime, disease, …) to its development. It tackles these challenges by analyzing and interpreting the situation, and by initiating actions to deal with it (e.g. purifying water, building houses, curing people from disease, preventing crime, …). This means that society possesses an implicit store of knowledge and an intelligence that applies that knowledge by making the necessary inferences and eventually reaching decisions about the actions to take. This intelligence is not localized in a central executive, such as a king or government, that would command and control the social system. It is rather distributed over billions of individuals, organizations, networks, documents containing specialized knowledge and regulations, computer programs, and machines that perform actions. Thus, the intelligence of society is similar to the one inherent in the brain (Minsky, 1988), where knowledge and inference processes are distributed across billions of neurons and their connecting synapses." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Demand in the economic sense is measured merely by the price agents are willing to pay for the thing they desire. This ignores the desires of agents that lack money, or their desires for things that cannot be bought—such as friendship, clean air, or democracy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The process of coordination between all the offers and demands that exist in the world remains highly inefficient. This creates a selective pressure for the development of a universal coordination protocol that would interconnect and eventually absorb or replace all existing sharing platforms—just like the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol did with all preceding computer networks. Thus, such a protocol would eliminate all the intermediaries, enabling immediate peer-to-peer transactions via an open, free, public medium. Such a medium for synergetic interaction would provide the foundation for what has been called the “collaborative commons” or “automated commons”, i.e. a vast virtual space in which anyone can share anything. This would completely change the rules of the present economy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In spite of its flexibility and apparent universality, a money-based, capitalist economy has a number of well-known shortcomings. Most generally, money or price as a onedimensional variable is much too coarse to express how various offers and demands differ in value according to multiple criteria—such as size, ease of use, beauty, sustainability, or social impact. In particular, there are fundamental values—such as happiness, love, or clean air— that intrinsically do not have a price, because they cannot be transferred from person to person and therefore have no exchange value. Moreover, human psychology does not treat value or preference as what mathematicians call a total order, but as a partial order: some things cannot be unambiguously ordered according to their value; in some contexts we prefer the one, in other contexts the other. Therefore, value can in general not be reduced to a universal, one-dimensional quantity." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There is another fundamental shortcoming of money. Because it can be exchanged for about any good or service, it is in practice the most powerful resource to possess. Moreover, its power increases proportionally to the amount you have: with double the amount of money, you can buy double the amount of things. Its linear, numerical character further means that it can be  accumulated unrestrictedly without losing any value. In this it is different from most other values, such as food, shelter or rest, which are subjected to diminishing returns: once you have had enough, you do not benefit by getting more. This has turned money into the dominant value of our society. Thus it has pushed aside values such as sustainability, community, happiness, or wisdom that are more fundamental, but more difficult to quantify or to accumulate. As a result, for many people money has become its own reward—rather than a means to a more basic end such as well-being, self-actualization, or social harmony.
>
> The dynamics of accumulation moreover leads to inequality, according to the wellknown positive feedback of the rich getting richer: the more money you have, the easier it is to invest surplus money in property, stocks or innovations that will get you even more money. This leads to the concentration of wealth in an ever-smaller group. An unfortunately common side effect is the poor getting poorer: the less money you have, the more difficult it is to invest in any business or form of self-development, such as education or health care, that would increase your income. What is worse, you will also have more difficulty to pay your general cost of living, and to find the resources, time or energy to tackle any unexpected problem that may occur. This makes it likely that you end up in a spiral of accumulating debt and the concomitant poverty.
>
> This [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) is boosted by globalization and the Internet: the easier movement of money, goods and information increases the reach of the most successful, thus increasing their profit, while reducing the profit of the less successful—even when the things they offer are virtually identical. The positive feedback of the Matthew effect in a sense negates the negative feedback of the invisible hand, where increase of demand is supposed to increase supply and thus again decrease demand. People who fall into poverty, e.g. because of illness, unemployment or debt, actually have a greater need for things like medical care, accommodation, and transport than people who live comfortably in their own home from the interests on their savings. But that demand is ignored by the invisible hand because poor people have no money to pay for the things they need. Therefore, as their situation worsens because they do not get what they need, their real demand increases rather than decreases.
>
> Another form of positive feedback is produced by speculation, which is a demand for things that are bought not for their intrinsic worth, but for the sole reason that they are expected to increase in price. Thus, increasing demand can lead to an expectation of prices increasing further and therefore to even higher demand. This vicious cycle produces the bubbles, booms and busts typical of a capitalist economy, and the concomitant market volatility and economic crises. This instability too is amplified by the easier movement of capital across the Internet.
>
> In sum, while money appears like a simple and flexible medium for matching offer and demand, in practice it produces a strongly distorted picture of the actual demand, ignoring many fundamental needs and values of society, while creating speculative demand for things that are not intrinsically valuable. Thus, it amplifies minor differences into growing inequality and instability." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In a small enough community everybody knows everybody, so that the community members have a good idea of who has given what and who has received what. People who give more than they receive gain prestige or reputation. On the other hand, people who take out more than they put in lose reputation. People with high reputation are more likely to receive what they want if they express a demand. This motivates them to increase their reputation further by giving more. On the other hand, if someone’s reputation would drop beneath a certain level, then people would stop giving anything, thus effectively excluding that person from the community and its benefits. This is an effective measure against free riders. Still, the needy—such as children, old or ill people—will not suffer loss of reputation even if they cannot reciprocate, because the community knows that they are not willfully abusing the system, and have made or will make contributions in other periods of their life.
>
> Such a gift economy can only work in a small community where there is a sufficient collective knowledge of people’s overall needs and contributions to keep the exchanges approximately in balance. This ability to survey the whole system—which Jean-François Noubel has called “holopticism”—enables a form of distributed intelligence that flexibly coordinates offer and demand. Our present global economy is much too complex for any individual or group to acquire such an overview of all the exchanges that occur. Nevertheless, thanks to the power of ICT the holoptic and balancing functions can be delegated to the emerging Global Brain, using the kind of production system algorithms we have discussed.
>
> To make this practically feasible we need to implement two additional features of a gift economy. First, we need the equivalent of a reputation system, which keeps track of the aggregate quality and quantity of the offers that each individual has made through the offer network, increasing that person’s reputation proportionally, while reducing it whenever the individual is observed to abuse the offer network. Computer-supported reputation systems have proven to be very effective in keeping vendors honest and constructive in online marketplaces and in motivating volunteers to make highquality contributions to open collaboration networks. While it will not be a trivial exercise to extend such systems to the level of a global offer network, it is likely that this will eventually happen through the same “disintermediation” dynamics that we have repeatedly encountered, in which local, mutually incompatible systems are eventually subsumed into a universal coordination protocol." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There are a range of other motives that can stimulate people to act towards the common good, including altruism, curiosity, desire for feedback, and sheer enthusiasm for a particular cause (Heylighen, 2007b). With the help of a user-friendly, “gamified” interface and the social-psychological mechanisms of reputation, flow and [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a smart ICT system can stimulate and coordinate such motivations so as to produce effective collective action. This would turn the offer network into a mobilization system. That means that it would not only match existing offers and demands, but also elicit new offers for anything for which there is an unfulfilled need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The traditional solution to this problem is for the government to tax negative externalities, such as pollution, and subsidize positive externalities, such as education—thus  making globally beneficial transactions more attractive. The difficulty with this approach is that estimating the overall external impact of anything is extremely complex and situation-dependent, as it involves an unlimited number of known and potential effects and side effects. Taxation, on the other hand, needs to follow a set of simple rules, formalized as laws, that are set by a central authority. This only allows a coarse and rigid correction that is unable to adapt to the subtleties of a complex situation. Another difficulty is that the most important, long-term externalities, such as climate change or loss of biodiversity, are global, whereas the authority of governments is national and their outlook short-term. Therefore, governments typically have neither the power nor the political will to efficiently regulate such global externalities.
>
> How could a global offer network deal with externalities? One advantage of an offer network is that it does not reduce demand to an aggregate of discrete transactions in which one party is willing to pay money to one other party in order to obtain some specific good or service. Demand should rather be seen as a collective preference for certain outcomes rather than other ones. This includes demands for non-monetizable values such as clean air, biodiversity, peace, or freedom. An intelligent, “holoptic” offer network should in principle be able to track to what degree individual or collective agents contribute to satisfying such demands. Agents that add to the most important values would be rewarded by a general increase in reputation, and therefore in their ability to satisfy their own demands. Agents that contribute negatively to values would be penalized by a loss of reputation, and therefore a loss in their ability to produce further harm. Thus, the network as a whole would motivate agents to seek positive externalities and avoid negative ones.
>
> This mechanism already plays to some degree at the global level. For example, firms that are seen to participate in rain forest destruction or exploitation of low-wage laborers lose reputation and therefore potential income from clients who would rather buy from more conscientious competitors. Vice-versa, organizations that contribute to the global good, e.g. by building schools in poor African villages, gain in reputation and are rewarded with donations and volunteer work. At the moment, this propagation of reputation still happens via the intermediary of NGOs, government institutes or specialized groups, such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace or Unesco. These monitor otherwise obscure external effects, and use the mass media and the Internet to broadcast their observations so as to expand people’s awareness of the global situation.
>
> Because of the general disintermediation dynamics, it is likely that this monitoring and propagation of “external” reputation will become increasingly integrated with the universal protocols of the Global Brain. This means in particular that there would no longer be any independent authority, such as a government, NGO, or UN organization, to decide what is good or bad for society. Instead, the different “authorities” would themselves be subjected to the same kind of reputation mechanisms as individual agents. This makes it possible to compute a global reputation as an aggregate of evaluations by individual and organizational agents, weighted by their respective reputation scores. Such an aggregate reputation can be determined in an intelligent manner through the propagation of trust weights in a social  network, using an equivalent of the PageRank algorithm. The result would be a distributed measure of trust or authority that would be more balanced, more diverse in its outlook, and less easily corruptible than any central authority (such as a government) in estimating to what degree the overall effects of an action would be positive or negative." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "A long-term effect of externalities is that they can make the system unsustainable, either by the accumulation of waste or pollution, or the exhaustion of non-renewable resources. A money-based economy can to some degree deal with the exploitation of scarce resources via the price mechanism: as a resource becomes scarcer, its price increases; therefore more effort will be done to save it, or to replace it by a more abundant resource. However, since waste does not have a price, it is ignored by the “invisible hand”, and therefore the market has no incentive to reduce it. Taxing waste or pollution is a traditional way of reducing this problem.
>
> However, an offer network can do better, by considering waste as an unconditional offer entered into the system. The network’s coordination algorithms would not only try to maximize the satisfaction of demands (“backward chaining”), but also the exploitation of offers (“forward chaining”). That means that they should search to match this offer of “waste” with some sequence of production rules that may convert it into something for which there is a demand. For example, the grape seeds that are a waste product from wine making can be transformed into grape seed oil, which in turn can be used for the production of food, while plastic from packaging can be reconverted to produce inexpensive park benches and toys.
>
> Thus, a well-balanced offer network should maximally recycle any “waste” that is produced as a side effect of satisfying demand. The realizability of full recycling is demonstrated by Chemical Organization Theory, a mathematical formalism based on “reactions” similar to the ones we described as production rules. The theory shows that a network of reactions tends to selforganize into a self-sustaining subnetwork, where everything that is consumed is also produced, and vice versa. The algorithms supporting an intelligent offer network should help us to find such self-sustaining system of cycles more quickly and efficiently." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Another global challenge that offer networks may be able to tackle is resilience. Complex networks of interdependencies are vulnerable to cascading failures: whenever part of the network is damaged by some unforeseen perturbation (e.g. an earthquake, a bankruptcy, an electricity overload, a computer virus) this problem may start to propagate through the network more quickly than it can be contained, until the network as a whole breaks down. This is for example what happened with  several large-scale electricity blackouts and with the 2008 financial collapse. A system is resilient if it can recover from perturbations before it is irreversibly damaged. Strategies to achieve resilience include:
>
> • preventing the positive feedbacks that make local disturbances cascade into global problems;
>
> • increasing the diversity of the components of the system, so that a problem affecting one is unlikely to affect others;
>
> • increasing redundancy, so that there are sufficient components to take over the function of those that were damaged; and
>
> • accurately monitoring (potential) problems so that they can be remedied before they get out of hand.
>
> All of these strategies are supported by offer networks. The envisaged surplus of offers creates a buffer against potential scarcity. The great diversity of available offers and methods to connect offers and demands provides sufficient redundancy so that demands can be satisfied even when the traditional supply routes are disrupted. This is similar to how the TCP/IP protocol made the Internet more resilient than rival networks, by providing a wide variety of alternative routes for retransmitting information packets that get lost. Moreover, the offer network would create a fine-grained map of the different needs the moment they appear, while providing intelligent algorithms that mobilize and route offers immediately to the place where the need is highest. Finally, because it does not rely on the accumulation of money, it prevents the positive feedbacks of speculation and the [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) that can lead to financial collapses and growing inequality." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

If I need something specific from the offer network, I should be able to formulate that need so that the network can recognize that it matches the offer that someone else has formulated. Natural language tends to be too ambiguous for the purpose, because words can have many meanings or just be too vague to express what I need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The role of a utopia is to create such a vision. Past utopias have been discredited mainly because their views were unrealistic: they failed to take into account the complexity of social systems and the tensions and contradictions inherent in human nature. As a result, their application to real societies have all too often produced spectacular failures. Yet, recent developments such as evolutionary psychology and the theory of complex adaptive systems, are providing fundamental insights in these complexities, opening up the perspective of a utopia that takes them duely into account. While a realistic model of a future society will necessarily be complex, abstract and with many shades of grey, a utopia must in the first place provide a simple and appealing picture, that people can easily visualize. These two requirements—of realistic complexity and of intuitive appeal—are inherently at odds, and therefore an acceptable utopia will have to be a compromise. In my own reflections on this issue, I have settled on the metaphor of the “global brain” for me as the most satisfactory vision of a positive, yet realistic future for humanity." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)

Like a human brain, this network is an immensely complex, self-organizing system, that processes information, makes decisions, solves problems, learns new connections and discovers new ideas. It plays the role of a nervous system for the whole of humanity.

Followers of the Gaia hypothesis have suggested that the "living Earth" of which we are all part deserves awe and worship; it therefore could form the basis of a secular, ecologically inspired religion.

> "Division of labor is based on the principle that if individuals specialize in carrying out particular tasks, they can be more efficient. However, if an individual is exclusively busy producing one particular type of commodity or service, then that individual will be dependent on reciprocation by others for providing the other resources (s)he needs. Therefore, division of labor can only evolve on a solid basis of cooperation. But once the process has started, division of labor will spontaneously increase, driven by a positive feedback mechanism, as illustrated by Gaines's (1994) computer simulation: individuals who were successful in providing a particular type of service—because of opportunity, competence or simply accident—will get more requests for that type of service, and thus get the chance to develop a growing expertise in the domain. This in turn will increase the demand for their specific service, stimulating them to further specialize...
>
> The increasing division of labor entails an accompanying increase in mutual dependence and therefore cooperativity. Cooperativity could be defined positively as probability or dependability of cooperation, and negatively as lack of cheating or free riding. This property of social systems is related to the concept of “social capital”. It is implicit in the legal system, the organization of the economy, and the unwritten rules which individuals follow in their interactions with others." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The cooperativity of a society may be estimated by indicators such as level of corruption or crime (negative), and tolerance or trust in other people (positive). These have all significant correlations with the overall quality of life or development level of a nation...

> "The increasing division of labor leads to a differentiation of the system into ever more specialized subunits. The increasing dependency of these units on the rest of the system, to compensate for the capacities they lost through specialization, leads to increasing integration and cohesion. Differentiation and integration together produce complexification of the global system, and an ever greater independence from the environment. The positive feedback relation between integration and differentiation leads to the accelerated development of a complex organization out of an aggregate of initially similar components. This is a metasystem transition: the evolutionary emergence of a higher level of cybernetic organization. This overall dynamic is at the base of both the evolution of multicellular organisms out of similar cells and of societies out of individuals." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "In the longer term, gains in stability due to low-friction, negative feedback are likely to be maintained or amplified, while the loss of stability due to low-friction, positive feedbacks will increase the selective pressure for evolving new regulatory mechanisms. For example, the appearance of a circulatory system in multicellular organisms strongly reduced friction, making it much easier for nutrients and hormonal signals to travel through the body. This gave the organism better overall control over its dispersed tissues and organs, allowing it to become larger and more differentiated. The disadvantage was that microbes too could travel more efficiently. This was compensated by the evolution of white blood cells, allowing the immune functions to keep up with the flow. Similarly, the spread of computer viruses and other threats on the computer network might be stemmed by an artificial immune system, inspired by the mechanisms (such as self-other distinction) used by white blood cells to recognize intruders.
>
> More generally, the easier flow of goods, people and money in a globalizing society has led to new dangers, such as international crime syndicates, money laundering, and competition between countries that erodes wages, governments' capacities to collect taxes, and working standards. These can only be solved by the creation of global control mechanisms, such as transnational crime fighting agencies, rules for international bank transfers, and agreements on minimum social standards (e.g. restricting the import of goods made by child labor). The need to monitor and control such problems is at the base of the increasing importance of global institutions, such as WTO, IMF, World Bank, WHO, and UN. Thus, if short-term catastrophes can be avoided, reduction of friction will further enhance the robustness of societal autopoiesis.
>
> A more subtle effect of reduced friction is the lengthening of cause-and-effect chains. Imagine a row of billiard balls, each ball a short distance from the next one. If you hit the first ball with your cue (cause), it will hit the second ball (effect), which will itself hit the third ball (second effect), and so on. Because of friction, energy is lost, and each next ball will move more slowly than the previous one, until the point where the ball stops before it has reached the next one in line: the causal chain has broken. With lower friction, the chain will be longer.
>
> This same mechanism applies to our low friction society. In earlier periods, an event happening in one country would have little or no effect on events happening in another country. The chain of effects would have died down long before it would have reached the national border. Nowadays, the world as a whole has become interdependent. A poor harvest in one country will affect the production in another country, which will affect the stock market in a third country, which will affect the employment in yet another country, and so on. Each of these events will not just have one effect, but many, each of which will again influence many other events. The ongoing decrease of friction makes these interactions more numerous and more complex.
>
> Because of this ever greater interdependency, subsystems of the superorganism need to keep informed about an increasing number of events taking place in other subsystems. Longer causal chains mean that many more potential causes and effects need to be monitored, resulting in the concurrent dangers of unpreparedness—when relevant information is not available—and information overload—when the system is incapable to effectively interpret the available information. This augments the selective pressure to develop a more sophisticated capacity for the gathering and processing of information, and therefore to increase the efficiency of the superorganism's nervous system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The reason why outsourcing increases efficiency is the cybernetic principle of functional autonomy. In a complex control system, consisting of many interrelated subsystems performing a variety of tasks, the higher order system cannot oversee the activities of all of its subsystems, since, according to Ashby's (1964) law of requisite variety, its own variety (complexity) would need to be at least as great as the variety of all the subsystems combined. In order to minimize the complexity of its own decisionmaking, the control system should as much as possible delegate decision-making to the subsystems, that is, make them autonomously responsible for carrying out their function. The only thing that needs to be controlled is whether the subsystems carry out their function; how they carry it out is up to them. This defines functional autonomy.
>
> It is only when the subsystems are incapable of making the right decisions that the higher-order system must intervene and tell them what to do. This means that the more autonomous subsystems are, that is, the more control they have over the way they carry out their function, the less hierarchical supervision they need. This is the essence of Aulin's (1982) law of requisite hierarchy: the required number of hierarchical levels decreases with increasing capacity for control in the subsystems. Since friction decreases and overall efficiency and control increase in all components of society, this means that present organizations and society at large can function with a strongly reduced number of hierarchical levels, thus making perception and action much more efficient. This explains the present trend towards the flattening of hierarchies. The towering pyramids of hierarchical levels in traditional bureaucracies merely reflected the poor regulatory ability of the individuals and subsystems in such a bureaucracy (and the tendency to institutionalize an intricate pecking order).
>
> Hierarchies not only tend to flatten, but to turn into heterarchies, that is, networks of mutual influence without subordination...
>
> In conclusion, the improvement in communication, processing and control in all components of global society has a far-reaching impact on the structure of that society: the number of organizations performing the same function tends to decrease because of mergers and competitive exclusion, whereas the number of organizations performing different functions tends to increase, because of outsourcing, innovation, specialization and the discovery of new niches. At the same time, hierarchies are flattened or turned into heterarchies, and organizations become more autonomous in how they perform their functions, while becoming more dependent on society as a whole to determine which functions are in demand. Also, organizations become less dependent on specific individuals or geographic regions, and more defined by their activity or function.
>
> Thus, society increasingly resembles a complex organism, with its specialized cells, organs and tissues, that are functionally autonomous, but tightly integrated in a global, self-organizing network of mutually feeding processes. This is in clear contrast with the more traditional view of society as a bunch of essentially interchangeable individuals, groups and subgroups, separated by geographic distance or historic accident, that are jostling for power, while making temporary alliances. An important remaining difference is that cells in an organism tend to specialize early and irreversibly, whereas individuals and organizations in society remain able to switch from one function to another as demand or opportunities change, keeping the overall system very flexible." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The most common objection to a superorganism model is that people tend to interpret it as a thinly disguised way of promoting a totalitarian, collectivist system. Especially the use of words such as “control” and “collective” evokes immediate associations with Stalinism and the brutal oppression of individual liberties. These negative connotations may be understandable, but they are wholly misdirected. The societal evolution I have sketched is mostly an extrapolation of existing trends, and these show an on-going increase in freedom, individualism, democracy and decentralization rather than a decrease. These trends can be explained straightforwardly by the postulated mechanisms of differentiation, which opens ever more possibilities for an individual to choose a role, education, or occupation, of reduced friction, which increases the general freedom of movement, of expression, and of consumption, and of increasing autonomy, which reduces the need to tightly control or monitor an individual's activities. The complementary mechanism of integration could be seen as a source of new constraints or limitations, but these are likely to restrict the freedom of powerful individuals—such as a Stalin-like dictator or a robber baron—and organizations to abuse the system for their own ends, rather than the freedom of ordinary people to realize their individual ambitions. Global integration means an increasing mutual dependency of various organizations, and therefore an increasing difficulty for any one organization to dominate the others. This is understandably resented by those who have most power to lose, but should be welcomed by the less powerful." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "Insofar that totalitarian societies were based on an ideological or political system, such as Soviet communism, this system was very different from the self-organizing, cybernetic, “organism-like” system that this paper proposes. As discussed by the cybernetician and Soviet dissident Valentin Turchin, the Soviet system lacked the most crucial component of cybernetic control: feedback. Instead of a distributed feedback loop, constantly adapting to the changing circumstances, the Soviet economy was based on a rigid, mechanical, top-down command structure, with little regard for the effect of those commands in the real world. This led to the well-known “calculation problem”, where the central planning agency would find it impossible to determine exactly how many shoes would need to be produced to satisfy the needs of a given population. The resulting economic inefficiency contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The common idea that what you lose in comfort by dropping out, you gain in freedom, is based on a misunderstanding of what “freedom” means. Without technology and social support systems, life is basically a struggle for survival, where most energy and time must be directed towards finding the necessary food and shelter. By removing these requirements, society has given us the real freedom of doing what we want, where we want it, and (most of the time) when we want it, without having to worry whether we will be able to survive. Especially technology, such as the transport and communication systems, has enormously expanded our freedom of movement and of communication. The more the superorganism increases its differentiation and integration, the more options we will have to choose our occupation, or go wherever we want whenever we want. Of course, belonging to an encompassing system does impose certain constraints, aimed at maximizing the synergy between interacting components and minimizing mutual obstruction. However, such constraints do not generally reduce overall freedom. This may be illustrated by the traffic code. Being able to travel with your car wherever you want is a great freedom, which people from previous ages could hardly even imagine. However, for many people to drive safely and with a minimum of interference on the same roads, traffic rules must be followed." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The possibility seems real that some groups or countries will effectively want to remain outside the emerging global society. It is also conceivable that different federations of countries will be formed, each following their own set of rules, while minimizing exchanges with each other. This happened to some degree during the Cold War when capitalist countries were politically and ideologically separated from the communist block. At the moment, the more important divisions perhaps oppose developed countries and developing nations, or countries with a Christian tradition and countries with an Islamic tradition. A deepening of such divisions could in principle lead to the creation of separate, competing superorganisms.
>
> Yet, there are several reasons why this scenario appears unlikely. The first reason is similar to the reason why individual drop-outs are rare. A country that would decide to leave the international community with its systems and rules, would immediately lose a great many benefits: resources, products, services, information, new technologies, solidarity, etc. This would significantly slow down or even reverse its development compared to other countries. This can be illustrated by the fate of “pariah” states, like Iraq, North Korea, or Albania before the fall of communism. Such growing backwardness would provide an increasingly strong incentive for the regime to change its policies.
>
> The negative effects of disconnecting from the rest of the world could be mitigated if a large number countries would “drop out” together, forming a rival block. However, the Cold War has shown that two competing blocks, even if they seem roughly matched in size, resources or military power, are unlikely to remain at the same level of development. Because economic and technological progress is an ever accelerating, exponential process, small differences in initial conditions or speed of development will lead to increasing gaps, until it becomes clear for everybody that the one block is more successful than the other one. This will put increasing pressure on the less successful block to open up towards the more successful one, in order to assimilate its successes.
>
> A second reason why a splitting up of the superorganism seems unlikely is the homogenizing effect of global communication on preferences and standards. If people have to choose between competing, but similarly valuable, alternatives, they tend to choose the one they encounter most often. This reinforces the lead of the most common one, in a positive feedback loop (the “law of increasing returns”) that quickly drives out all alternatives but one (“lock-in”). In a situation where communication between groups is limited, this may lead to different standards in different groups, but in an era of fast, global communication, all groups will tend to converge on a single standard in a rather short time." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "Since society is an organismic system consisting of organisms (individual people), it can be viewed as a “superorganism”. Conspicuous trends such as globalization, automation, and the rise of computer networks can be understood as aspects of the general evolution towards increasing efficiency and interconnectedness which makes the superorganism ever more robust. In particular, increasing efficiency explains the growing economic productivity and the decrease of friction, which facilitates all material and informational exchanges. The accompanying differentiation and integration explain the seemingly opposite trends towards outsourcing and mergers, and the growing importance of supranational rules, standards and institutions. Increasing efficiency of communication and control moreover explains the increasing functional autonomy of components (individuals or organizations), and the concurrent flattening of hierarchies and rise of heterarchies.
>
> Although the effects of these trends are mostly positive, for both individuals and society as a whole, some of the side-effects can be detrimental. Reduced friction in particular increases the risk that positive feedback processes would get out of control. It also leads to increasingly complex causal chains of interconnected events, augmenting the need for information gathering and processing. Controlling these dangers requires a strengthening of the superorganism's nervous system. This control system has both centralized and distributed components. Centralization is exemplified by the growing importance of global institutions, responsible for the formulation and implementation of international standards, rules and laws.
>
> Distributed control can be exemplified by the “invisible hand” that mutually adjusts supply and demand. Its effectiveness is boosted by the emerging global computer network. The increasing reach, capacity, and intelligence of this network allow it to automate more and more functions of the superorganism's nervous system. This will transform the World-Wide Web into a “global brain”, capable of sensing, interpreting, learning, thinking, deciding, and initiating actions. Individuals are likely to become more and more intimately connected to this intelligent network, through ubiquitous, intuitive interfaces, and eventually a direct brain-to-web connection." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)



> "Historically, I distinguish three approaches: organicist, encyclopedist and emergentist. While each of these conceptions provides an inspiring metaphor for understanding and guiding social development, each also has major shortcomings. The organicist perspective, by ignoring conflicts and competition and by studying the way things are, rather than how they might be or ought to be, tends to promote a status quo. The encyclopedist view, while inherently progressive, relies too much on rational planning and organization, and tends to ignore not only the potential for conflict, but also the intrinsic difficulty of unifying and centralizing something as context-dependent, complex and changeful as the world’s knowledge. The emergentist perspective, while emphasizing the potential for self-organization and radical evolutionary innovation, seems to suffer from wishful thinking, assuming that we just need to communicate more, become more conscious, or use technology to see a global brain miraculously emerge.
>
> I argue that these shortcomings can be overcome by integrating two existing theoretical frameworks: evolutionary theory and cybernetics. Biological evolution points us to the intrinsic sources of conflict, and how these have been overcome by evolving synergetic systems and control mechanisms against free riders. Cybernetics shows us how systems and control are organized in levels, and based on knowledge and communication. Evolutionary cybernetics introduces the concept of metasystem transition: the self-organization of individual components into a positive-sum system that functions at a higher level of intelligence and consciousness. More specific models associated with cybernetics, such as neural networks, distributed knowledge systems and stigmergy, help us to design concrete technologies that could support such a collective intelligence. The World Wide Web, finally, provides an extremely flexible and powerful platform for implementing and testing such technologies at the global level." - [Conceptions of a Global Brain: An Historical Review, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf)



> "Self-organization establishes a relation between the behavior of the individual components and the structure and functionality of the system as a whole: simple interactions at the local level give rise to complex patterns at the global level. This phenomenon is called emergence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Coordination can then be defined as: the structuring of actions in time and (social) space so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy between these actions. Coordination can be subdivided in four elementary processes or mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow, and aggregation." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Alignment is the simplest form of coordination. It means that the different actions (and therefore also their agents) “point in the same direction”, or, more precisely, aim at the same target." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Friction does not in general imply conflict between the agents, though. Perhaps the two individuals really want to reach the same overall goal, such as getting the obstacle off the road. However, because their actions are not coordinated, they effectively oppose each other. To minimize friction, they should somehow come to push in the same direction, i.e. align their actions." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This example illustrates the mechanism of self-organization at the most elementary level. An action that is not succesful will normally be varied (variation). On the other hand, an action that is successful will be maintained or reinforced (selective retention or multiplication). Successful actions are characterized by minimal friction and maximal synergy. Therefore, the evolutionary mechanism of the blind-variation-and-natural-selection of actions will sooner or later produce an interaction that is more synergetic and less frictional. This mechanism does not require any planning, knowledge, or intelligence on the part of the agents. The only assumption is that the agents obey a logic of trial-and-error or variation-and-selection, producing a variety of actions until they find one that is maximally productive and stick to that one, irrespective of what causes that increase in productivity. Therefore, self-organization is a process that occurs at all levels, from atoms to societies. Note that this mechanism synthesizes the principles of self-organization originally formulated by the founding fathers of the domain. Ashby conceived selforganization as the automatic “selection” of stable states (attractors) by a dynamic system. Von Foerster and Prigogine added that such attractors will be reached more quickly by injecting “random” or blind variation into the system, a principle they called “order from noise”, “order through fluctuations”, or “order out of chaos”." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Assume that agents prefer to do the tasks they are most skilled at, because those are the ones that will cost them least effort. In that case, it suffices for the different tasks to be laid out in such a way that all available agents can examine them. As soon as an agent recognizes a task that it is particularly skilled at, it will pick up that task, leaving less fitting tasks for the others. Thus, the number of remaining tasks will gradually diminish. There is of course the risk that the remaining tasks fit none of the remaining agents, but we can make the assumption that all agents are flexible to some degree and can if necessary do a task they are not particularly skilled at, albeit less efficiently. In this way, the different tasks will get performed in an overall rather efficient way, although the arrangement may not be optimal. (Such less-than-optimal, but more-thanacceptable performance is what we normally find in the real world, as opposed to the idealized world of mathematical models, where things tend to work either perfectly, or not at all…).
>
> One example of such self-organizing division of labor is Wikipedia, the Internet encyclopedia that is being written collaboratively by millions of people worldwide. No “editorin-chief” has divided the labor among the contributors, by specifying which expert should write a page on which subject, as is done in traditional encyclopedias. Instead, the “experts” have selfselected by starting to write, adding to, or correcting any page for which they felt they had sufficient competence to make a contribution. Thus, a football supporter may add something about the scoring percentages of his favorite team, while a butterfly collector may contribute something about the color patterns of her favorite species...
>
> With some minor variations, the same process happens in a market economy: different businesses spread out and specialize so as to maximally fill each of the available niches, i.e. delivering the specific products and services for which there is sufficient demand, and for which their competence in delivering it is at least as good as the one of their competitors. This form of self-organizing allocation of agents (firms) to tasks (supplying goods and services) is sometimes referred to as the “invisible hand” of the market. While in practice the solution will never be optimal, it has proven to be far superior to the alternative of a centralized economic planning, as practiced e.g. in the Soviet Union. The reason is that the “calculation problem” of establishing exactly how many goods of which type need to be delivered by whom is much too complex to be solved by any planner. Only self-organization can produce robust solutions to problems of such complexity and variability." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "As long as a large enough number of agents with sufficiently diverse or broad skills is available, such a self-organizing solution to the problem of workflow can be quite efficient. There is no need to plan when a particular agent should execute a particular task, as long as enough agents are available so that a sufficiently skilled one is ready to take over soon after the previous task is finished." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "While division of labor is a branching process, where an activity is split up into smaller, independently executed tasks, aggregation goes the other way, letting the branches converge again into a single result. Division of labor, workflow and aggregation can be seen as the three fundamental aspects or dimensions of a complex, branching network of mutually dependent processes.
>
> Aggregation too allows for self-organizing approaches. The simplest one is when the different actions superimpose their results on a shared substrate or medium. For example, the work done by the different builders and technicians on a house accumulates in the physical building itself. There is no need to assemble the plumbing with the electrical circuitry as both have been installed on the same walls. But aggregation via a shared medium can also apply to more abstract, informational activities. Again, Wikipedia provides an excellent example: the different contributions to this encyclopedia of global knowledge are aggregated automatically because they are added to the same website. Without this shared electronic medium, assembling the millions of contributions into a coherent whole would have been a task of gigantic proportions...
>
> A different form of self-organizing aggregation occurs when the products of the different activities can interact and develop links or “bonds”, where the one fits in with the other. The examples we discussed before of the spontaneous division of labor in ecosystems or market economies are also examples of spontaneous integration. Businesses or species not only differentiate from other businesses or species in order to better occupy as yet unclaimed niches, they also connect themselves to other businesses or species as providers of resources or services that they need for their own functioning. Thus, a typical business will be a tightly linked hub in a network of suppliers, clients, employees, regulators, and other stakeholders that all depend on each other. Together, they form an integrated socioeconomic system that performs a coherent set of functions for society. The mechanism behind this is again variation and selection: agents interact with many other agents. If the interaction is succesful, they will tend to maintain it (selective retention), thus creating a stable bond of mutual dependency. Otherwise, the interaction will be stopped (elimination) and replaced by another one." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Collective intelligence assumes thatdifferent agents have different forms of expertise (knowledge, information, skills). Otherwise,they would not be able to do more together than individually. Achieving collective intelligencetherefore is a problem of cognitive coordination between the different agents. This can again besplit up into the four basic mechanisms of alignment, division of labor, workflow andaggregation.
>
> Alignment means that the agents should point at the same targets, so that they do notwork at cross-purposes. This implies that agents should agree at least about what the problem isthat is to be solved, and about what the different tools or methods are they may need to tackle itcollaboratively. However, alignment here does not mean that the agents should perform thesame actions, because in that case there is no collective intelligence. Adding identical effortstogether, like when a number of agents push a heavy weight in the same direction, only makessense when performing physical tasks, not when processing information. Indeed, when you adda piece of information (e.g. X=3) to the same piece of information (X=3), you still only have asingle piece of information. Therefore, a division of labor, in the sense of different agentscontributing different information, is essential. Depending on the complexity of the problem,workflow may or may not be needed. Some problems can be solved in a single step, all agentssimultaneously contributing their expertise. Others need several iterations, the one buildingfurther on the previous one. But the final step of aggregating all the contributions remainsessential in order to come to a coherent answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "[Surowiecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Surowiecki) proposes the following list of requirementsthat a group must fulfil to exhibit collective intelligence (or wisdom of crowds, as he calls it):
>
> • Diversity: the more diverse the knowledge and experience possessed by the differentmembers of the group, the more the group as whole knows and the less its members arelikely to overlook certain aspects, or to fall prey to the same bias.
>
> • Independence: individuals should express their contribution as much as possibleindependently from other members of the group; otherwise, when the opinion of the oneis influenced by the opinion of the other, there is a risk of premature alignment, i.e.between the contributions themselves rather than between the targets of thecontributions.
>
> • Decentralization: this Surowiecky’s term for what we have called “division of labor”:people should as much as possible be able to gather and process their information inparallel, so that they can together cover an as wide range of aspects as possible.
>
> • Aggregation: collective intelligence requires an effective mechanism, such as voting,averaging or discussion, for synthesizing a diversity of individual opinions into a single,collective answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The most important issue in such collective processes is to avoid what Janis has called “groupthink”. This is the phenomenon where people in a group all start to think the same, because a slight initial preference for one approach rather than another becomes amplified via positive feedback. The underlying dynamic is that if someone hears an opinion expressed by someone else, s/he will be more inclined to express a similar opinion. This happens partly because hearing a certain approach will “prime” the mind to consider things from the same perspective, partly because people tend to be conformist, and do not like to contradict or appear to be in conflict with others. The more often similar opinions have been expressed, the less likely group members are to express dissimilar opinions—partly out of conformism, partly because the more they hear a particular position defended, the more they will get convinced that this is the right one, and the less they will be inclined to think of alternatives. In that way, they may all quickly converge to the same opinion, without giving potentially better alternatives the chance to be duly considered.
>
> A more extreme version of this process leads to the phenomenon of group polarization (also known as “risky shift”). This refers to the common observation that groups tend to be more extreme in their judgments after a discussion than the members were individually before the discussion. “More extreme” here means deviating more from the middle ground. For example, if jury members are individually inclined to judge a crime relatively harshly (e.g. proposing a 15-year prison sentence on average), after the debates they will tend to judge it even more harshly (e.g. deciding on a 25-year prison term). If a different group is asked to judge the same crime, but the members are individually inclined to be more lenient (e.g. proposing a 10-year sentence on average), as a group they are likely to come to an even more lenient judgment (e.g. a 5-year sentence). Polarization can be explained by the positive feedback underlying alignment, which amplifies deviations: the more people hear arguments for a “risky” position, the more they will think themselves of additional arguments for that position, and the more confident they will become in moving further away from the “safe” middle ground.

> Groupthink is an example of self-organization gone wrong, where non-linear interaction has led to premature alignment on a suboptimal solution, and where the positive contributions of diversity and division of labor have been neglected." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The simplest way to avoid groupthink is to disallow direct communication between the group members, so that the one cannot influence the other one until everyone has been able make a full contribution. However, a collective solution still requires an aggregation mechanism that integrates these different contributions.
>
> This is perhaps easiest to achieve when the looked for solution can be expressed as a number. In that case, everyone can independently make an estimate of the correct number, e.g. by writing it onto a piece of paper. The pieces are then collected, and the final solution is aggregated by calculating the average of the numbers. In many cases, this produces remarkably good results. For example, when at a fair people are asked to estimate the number of beans in a jar, or the weight of a bull, the average of their guesses is typically much more accurate than even the best of the individual guesses. The reason is that each individual guess is biased by the limited experience of that individual, making the estimate either too low or too high. However, when many independent estimates are aggregated, these “errors” or deviations from the optimal solution tend to be “averaged out”, because of the law of large numbers. This phenomenon can be demonstrated through agent simulations even for more complex problem solutions, as long as the solution can be expressed as a  sequence of numbers that need to be averaged, and as long as the individual agents vary randomly in the errors they make.
>
> However, when different individuals tend to have the same bias (e.g. all overestimating the weight of the bull), their aggregate solution will exhibit that bias too, and the best individual estimate will be more accurate than the average for the group.
>
> The averaging method only works for quantitative decisions. Some of the most common methods, such as discussion in committee meetings, do not obey the criteria of independence and decentralization, and therefore may lead to poor results. The result can be improved if the different members express their opinions independently and anonymously (e.g. on a computersupported discussion system) before they start responding to the opinions of others, and if the discussion is guided by a neutral moderator, who ensures that everybody duly answers all the important questions, and responds to criticisms of their previous answers. The anonymity makes sure that everybody’s ideas are given equal attention (instead of the discussion being dominated by the more authoritative people). This is the basis of the so-called Delphi method that aggregates the ideas of a panel of experts, via several rounds of anonymous, mediated discussion." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "To shift from individual intelligence to collective intelligence, we need to make intentionality collective as well. Words and other symbols can only be used for effective communication if the conversation partners understand them in the same way, that is if they agree about wat the word refers to. Developing such shared references is a problem of what we have called alignment. We have defined alignment as the unification or merging of the targets of different actions or agents. As long as there is no “director” agent to impose a target on the others, this problem can only be solved through selforganization, that is, spontaneous, reciprocal adaptation of the agents’ targets." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This is the same mechanism of alignment that underlies all self-organization: by reducing the friction that is otherwise caused by the need to recognize and interpret a novel form and because of the high probability of confusion that arises if the conversation partners use different forms, alignment on the same forms makes communication more efficient. As shown by many experiments and observations, one-to-one alignment is a very quick and automatic process that makes conversation much easier than it would be if the partners would have to explicitly agree about how they refer to the different items in their shared context Conversational alignment will not only produce shared references; it will moreover tend to make those references simpler and more efficient." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Establishing a shared system of reference (alignment) is only the first step in collaboratively solving a problem. Moreover, alignment can go too far, in the sense that unusual, but valuable, approaches are suppressed because of the tendency of the largest subgroup to impose its “targets” on the rest of the group. When alignment merely concerns the establishment of lexical conventions or agreed-upon labels, then in essence any label is as good as any other, and alignment is a priori positive. However, when the “targets” of thought and action are fundamentally different, excluding some targets because they represent minority positions will a priori reduce the potential for collective intelligence. Typical experiments in collective problemsolving either artificially impose maximal independence on the individuals (e.g. requiring them to write down their opinion anonymously) until the moment when their contributions are aggregated (e.g. by counting votes or averaging guesses), or allow free-ranging discussion with the intent to come to a consensual decision, thus running the risk of groupthink and a loss of collective intelligence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Typical conditions that have been proposed for the emergence of groupthink are direction by an authoritative leader, conformity pressure, and the need to come to a clear-cut consensus. All were absent in the experimental set-up. Since the issue they discussed had 20 different components, it was difficult to come to a clear conclusion. Perhaps most importantly, the participants filled in the survey individually after the discussion. Therefore, there was no pressure, neither explicitly nor implicitly, to “conform” to the opinions of the others, since no one knew exactly what those others had entered in their survey forms. Still, there was some convergence between opinions, but this seems to have been of the “healthy” kind, where participants learned things from each other that were missing from their own limited perspective." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The underlying dynamic of self-organization is local trial-and-error or variation-andselection, in which two interacting agents try to mutually adapt their actions, until they hit on a “coordinated” pattern that is acceptable to both, and thus is selectively retained. This local pattern is then typically propagated step-by-step to the neighboring agents and the neighbors’ neighbors. The spreading “wave” of coordination is thus amplified until it encompasses the global system, via a process of positive feedback.
>
> Coordination can be decomposed into four relatively independent mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation. Alignment is the simplest, as it merely requires the agents to “point in the same direction”, i.e. direct their actions at the same targets. This is necessary to avoid the friction that is otherwise caused by opposing actions. Alignment creates convergence or homogeneity between interacting agents. When the agents are distributed across space, the resulting homogeneity may be limited to a certain region, with boundaries between differently aligned regions emerging after self-organization. This can explain the appearance of separate cultures or languages, and the points of friction between them.
>
> Even when such remaining friction is avoided, alignment is not yet sufficient to reap the full benefits of synergy, in which the whole of the actions produces more than the sum of the effects produced by each action separately. Synergy requires complementarity, in which one action makes up for what the other one lacks, so that together they can achieve goals that they cannot achieve alone. Synergy is promoted by the other three coordination mechanism. Division of labor means that different agents perform different actions at the same time, so that each can contribute its unique expertise to the part of problem it is most skilled at. Workflow means that an action is followed by a subsequent action that fills in the gaps left by the previous one. Aggregation, finally, ensures that all these different contributions are assembled into a coherent outcome." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The first issue here is the emergence of collective intentionality: how do groups align the targets of their communications and actions? In the domain of language, this problem has been investigated by means of a variety of software simulations and experiments with groups or pairs of conversing individuals. The basic mechanism is that each time an agent targets a particular referent or communicative structure in its interaction with another agent, this primes (weakly prepares) the second agent to target a similar referent, making a shift towards a common referent slightly easier. Many such small, individual shifts eventually snowball into the emergence of a reference shared by the whole group. This research confirms and illustrates the general mechanism of self-organizing alignment, while clarifying the origin of linguistic conventions.
>
> A second issue is the emergence of collective intelligence: in how far do people manage to solve problems better as a group than individually? Most research in this domain has focused on the problems of groupthink and polarization, a form of premature alignment in which valuable contributions are suppressed because of a tendency of groups to conform to and reinforce any emerging consensus. This results in phenomena of “collective stupidity” or “madness of crowds”, rather than “collective intelligence” or “wisdom of crowds”. The general  recommendation therefore has been to minimize the (non-linear) interactions between individuals that promote alignment, and to use some neutral mechanism such as averaging to directly aggregate the individual contributions. While this strategy is undoubtedly useful in a number of cases, it risks to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as it makes self-organizing division of labor and especially workflow more difficult." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "if you go up in evolution to more and more sophisticated organisms, and then you look at the horizon in space and time—that’s to say: the things that they can either remember or imagine or perceive to be things that have happened or could be happening—as you go from a bacterium to a multicellular organism, to a simple animal, to a human, that horizon expands. So we become more and more aware of things that are happening or maybe happening not in our immediate spatial-temporal neighborhood. We become more and more aware of things that may be far removed in time and space. And that could be a simple interpretation of this law of growth of complexity. The field of complexity—that means that the things you can be conscious of—tends to increase with evolution. And there’s a good reason why that should be. That is that evolution is based on natural selection. Natural selection means fitness, means the ability to deal with all kinds of problems and challenges. And the wider your horizon is, the better you can see any possible challenges coming, the better you will be ready to deal with the difficult ones and to protect yourself from them, and the better you will also be ready to deal with a positive ones; to exploit the opportunities. So I think this view of the superorganism is telling us that we should expand our horizon of consciousness from the individual human to the level of humanity as a whole." - [Francis Heylighen](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/glimpsing-the-global-brain#:~:text=if%20you%20go,as%20a%20whole.)

> "Since the environment anyway is variable, the more adaptability you have at the moment, the better you are. So there is a tendency to evolve into systems that can adapt to a wide range of things. If they can adapt only to a particular range of things, they are likely to be eliminated by the next change in the environment. So this increase in the range of things we can deal with, that’s something that can be expressed even in the form of a cybernetic law. It’s called the Law of Requisite Variety. The cyberneticist Ashby says: if you have to deal with various perturbations, the more [variety of actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)) that you can do, the better you will be able to deal with all these problems. So there is, you might say, a selective pressure for living systems to increase the variety of things they can do. And increasing the things they can do, that means on the one hand getting the physiological anatomical features to do these things—which means increasing complexity—but it also means a kind of a cognitive increase: an increase in the number of things that they can sense and the amount of knowledge they have to know “How do I deal with these circumstances?” So the selective pressure is to increase the range of challenges you can deal with, and that is a progressive evolution. There is no doubt about that. The example I gave supposed that you have two systems, one that can deal with situation A, B, C, and the other one can deal with situations A, B, C, D. Well, as long as the situation is A, B, or C, they’re both equally good. But the moment that the situation changes into D, the first one gets killed off and the second one remains. So therefore, there is a selective pressure to be able to deal with a wider range of things. And that implies all this progressive evolution towards more intelligence, more consciousness, more flexibility, more complexity, et cetera. So the third story is really that evolution is progressive. We learn to deal with a wider range of situations. We expand our consciousness to a wider range of challenges and opportunities." - [Francis Heylighen](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/glimpsing-the-global-brain#:~:text=since%20the%20environment,challenges%20and%20opportunities.)

an environment where a single identity is used for a long time and it accrues reputation is an environment of repeated interaction - the prisoner's dillema is solved - robert axelrod
^^ THIS IS A HUGE POINT !!!

think about how the material of RethinkX would fit in this epistemological ecosystem

we can incentivize people to fill out questions to "complete their profile" and nudge them towards answering "top 10 civilizational concerns" - something they might have never even thought about. Some would perhaps look around at what scientists have had to say and boost their answers - hopefully, few would turn to kim kardashian for that sort of question

delegating your vote to someone that you agree with can be more impactful than voting directly because it elevates them and their arguments and narrows down the set of arguments for a debate - making things more manageable

social norms are the most powerful mechanism to leverage change

"Cooperation & transparency" as the One Commandment

This is how the internet is turned into a neural net

just like Data Availability layers allow for higher-level modular blockchain forking without much infrastructure hassle, the same way communities can fork with different models that treat & interpret the same set of events differently

Internet 2.0 is a global neural net centered around identity

A agent-weighted library of Alexandria

Integrated information processing

Social media 1.0 was designed for consumption - what if we designed it for expressivity, meaning, creation, collaboration and epistemic coherence & compounding?

We can publicly entice/bribe corporations with greater memetic distribution to align with our goals

Objective reputation has to be a cornerstone


Radical markets for names?

Money is under the control of misaligned, corrupt, dysfunctional and incompetent governments and banks. Status is under the control of media and money. We can redesign status as a new type of flexible currency thats evolvable to whatever we need it to be

What if we obsoleted the money-on-money-return game in favor of status-on-status-return built on top of competence, accountability and cooperation - the infinite game, not one bound to resources?

The internet & the digital in their final form as a memetic evolutionary substrate - no architectural restrictions

One of the dials could be status vs virality of an event as a spectrum

the only enemy is entropy

separate "severity/importance" and "likelihood", so that we can weight in on these 2 aspects separately

resiliency! can survive internet partitioning like the Chinese firewall if the chain is only on one end - data can be created & made addressable by an application on one side of the internet, then they sign a transaction to anchor the data to the chain, then that anchoring transaction and all the data can be physically moved on some storage device to the other part of the internet & the anchoring transaction can be submitted - now both sides can address the same events the same way. Just like IPFS.

we can vote and agree on what is acceptable and what is not - a big taxonomy of unacceptability - and then use that shared standard to rank online actions

A participatory incentive design system for societies and our civilization

Internet of people/influencers ==> internet of ideas

the global brain in 1 sentence, 1000 words, 1 essay

2 notifications? Show only one and save the other for later! pure evil... some apps do this...
Are the apps working for you?
We need to put the humans first

Collectively programming humanity

We need to take back control over how the epistemic sausage is made

We need to reimplement the “rules-based international order”
UH - united humanity

The terms of the debt jubilee will be dictated by the global brain

A socially wired global neural network

the race to the top on transparency

One commandment: epistemic health

Whistleblowing should pay

The one commandment: most people are good

Bashing utopias as unrealistic and dangerous by pointing to epistemologically bankrupt historic examples that lead to catastrophes is a limiting & self-manifesting/reinforcing belief
It also lacks any imagination and attempt for creativity

The belief that utopian visions are dangerous is a dangerous belief

Turning the other cheek is a metaphor for escaping the dictates of your immediate impulses and motivations. Resisting temptation - the evolutionarily installed impulses that were useful in past evolution.
We need to learn from religious movements and apply the insights to a materialistic worldview

This is the Manhattan project for reclaiming our consciousness

We can score a NYT piece on a multitude of factors - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations

What if we treated media like science - requiring citations and quotes for everything?

Epistemic architecture

> "If something cannot go on forever, it will stop." - [Herbert Stein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/467811-if-something-cannot-go-on-forever-it-will-stop)



epistemic crisis - a crisis of knowledge

despite the overwhelming amounts of information available to us - we are more polarized than ever and it is harder to separate fact from fiction

What about the Fermi paradox? Perhaps life everywhere else couldn’t build the global brain.

Motivated reasoning should be abolished/countered/made visible

We can reward pre-commitments how data will be treated

Top 10 ways to improve X field/concept/entity

Think of how current services (science journals, stack exchange websites) can make it so the reputation of someone can be linked to their identity of choice & made addressable & exportable so that it can be fed into models

People are conditioned into passivity, cynicism and helplessness

A distributed and participatory social landscape

A participatory social operating system

The lack of shared intentionality - a shared worldview - is perhaps our fundamental issue

Some of the quotes in this book are probably misattributed - wouldn't it be nice to be able to cryptographically prove their provenance by quoting a part of the source text linked to identity?

btw още няколко неща които ще може да се правят ако експрес-ваме семантично идеите - освен да се изчисли score спрямо някакъв модел/правила и някаква база данни от "факти", ще може човек сам да си дебъг-ва мислите като търси логически конфликти, и ще може да прави diff спрямо идеите на някой друг - да види % препокриване и съгласие (както и конфликт).
и ще може да query-ваш кои други имат еди какво си мнение

we can have tribunals for claims of corruption and reward journalists & investigators who correctly (according to a tribunal of our choice) map such instances in the real world to entities

Unification of entities/concepts/events and the ability to aggregate and open access to freely compose, associate and extend the data and functionality are a way to fix asymmetries of power

Levels of openness & alignment - different rewards by the network
- Sharing patents?
- Open source?
- Permissive license? License to others in this ecosystem?
- Planned obsolescence? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5v8D-alAKE
- using hypernormal stimuli?
ESG scores
- pressure/incentivize a basket of companies to pool capital and fund some research so that the funding is distributed, and also define for them all of the areas that need research so that the companies aren't selective for what suits them.

imagine if the insights and conclusions of any book or long-form media were encoded in the giant epistemological graph and you could see which parts of the world are affected, where there is consensus/conflict, etc.

what if the whole system recalculates everything automatically when a fact (assumption) changes and based on specific criteria sends appropriate notifications - showing a diff & implications of the changes?
What if a core fundamental assumption you have gets overturned - wouldn't you want to know the transitive impact of that change?

Examples for feeds: 1) friends, 2) interests (and for different interests - finance/hobbies), 3) groups

> "Somehow problem solvers reliably (but not perfectly) zero in on the relevant information to be investigated. They do not do this abstractly, but in the way they formulate the problem. How individuals represent the initial state, goal state, operations, and path constraints, is the way in which they attempt to zero in on relevant information. Problem formulation is how problem solvers constrain the search space of a particular problem so that heuristics can effectively apply to it. Problem formulation captures what problem solvers deem relevant to a specific problem, and this formulation helps them to intelligently ignore most of the information in the search space. To intelligently ignore means that problem solvers do not even consider most available information, and they find and focus upon information that turns out to be relevant without comparing it to all the irrelevant information that is available." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Consider how we are beset by ill-defined problems all day long such as following and/or joining a conversation successfully, getting and/or telling a joke or telling a story. As such, we frequently have to generate problem formulations in order to both address ill-definedness and to avoid combinatorial explosion. Not only do we have to zero in on relevant information, we often have to generate missing relevant information in order to do so. Problem formulation handles both of these demands and is a primary way in which we do relevance realization within problem solving.
>
> However, sometimes the problem formulation constrains a problem in such a way so that it cannot be solved; the problem formulation itself becomes problematic. In these circumstances, the problem formulations need to be broken up and reformulated. The solver must have an insight: their relevance realization abilities have to be flexibly recursive and self-correcting. They have to realize that they have misformulated the problem and be capable of generating a new relevance profile that then informs a new, more effective formulation." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "We never represent all the properties of anything because we are in the finitary predicament. We always only represent a subset of any real world things. This subset of features and how they hang together is an aspect. All representation is aspectual. Yet an aspect is a zeroing in on properties deemed relevant, and a formulation of those properties as highly relevant to each other and to oneself and others. The ability to represent crucially presupposes the ability to realize relevance and therefore cannot serve as a basis of explaining it without circularity." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Relevance realization must be happening at a level of analysis more basic than standard information processing. Yet it cannot be handled by some central processor because that processor would face a combinatorial explosion of information facing it even within the brain’s own processing. The processing of relevance realization has to happen as a constraint on all processing both local and global within the brain. Relevance realization has to be internal, sub-semantic, sub-syntactic, and scale invariant in its operations. Finally, it must be completely self-organizing because it has to be a self-correcting and self-transforming process." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions. Taken together, combinatorial complexity in problem solving, the largely ill-defined nature of most problems and the consideration of consequences serve to indicate the centrality of our relevance realization machinery. Thus, relevance realization is central; it involves the ability to frame our cognition and, most importantly, to do this flexibly, i.e. to be able to reframe. This ability to reframe how we find things relevant is sometimes experienced as the “aha” moment called insight." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

shared intentionality (values, beliefs, practices) is necessary for effective human cooperation - and it has broken down in the West
we need diversity of opinion and unifying goals - diversity/differentiation and integration

chimps follow the head, humans follow the eyes - shared intentionality
chimps follow the head - even if the eyes are closed.
humans follow the eyes - even if the head is stationary.
human eyes are clearly visible - evolved to signal attention (whites, etc), whereas chimp eyes are much more occluded/hidden

Ideally each side would doggedly pursue its opponents, forcing them to relent and give real answers — while reciprocating the favor.

on prediction markets...
Involving money & futures contracts on any outcome might put skin in the game but has proven controversial (especially when it comes to terrorist attacks & assassinations):

We can reward with reputation/status/influence - not money. Also we can have prediction markets and simply vote which topics would be covered and which would not.
Involving money requires fixing the oracle problem - we can avoid that and simply choose fact databases and decide how to calculate reputation.
Financial contracts might probably also require syncing with these folks:

Who benefits the most from fractured & incoherent epistemic commons and uncoordinated & uneducated masses?

there are no secret laws. We should be able to work on them in public, transparently and accountably

Status economics

We can reward companies when they contribute private data to the public commons
Power is with the people to vote how to score entities - not with infra providers and applications which want more advertising dollars and have a conflict of interest

Ending destructive competition and unifying humanity makes sense. How do we build the global brain?

We need to gamify the contribution to a coherent and unified knowledge base 

Concepts and events are singular and unique, opinions are subjective and multi-perspectival

What is our civilizational objective function?

Rejecting the rule of hypocrites and psychopaths is moral

Society has a balance sheet - lets crowdsource it


People are used to and reduced to passive consumption - recommendation engines

structurally removing the capacity for corruption through technology

a causal map can reveal the fundamental generator functions of our biggest problems

identify perverse incentives, multipolar traps, coordination failures, and destructive competition

society's signal amplification method is broken

signaling at different scales - locally, nationally, globally - trying to tell different things to different group sizes

The elephant in the room is human alignment



Bitcoin and appchains (the first wave) vs ethereum & fully programmable chains (& even modular designs)
Analogy: all the different social media apps vs a unified identity layer and permissionless composability. This is the final abstraction


If the left and right really dont want to share the same town hall - they can have two different models for the state (built from the events)

What an open identity layer lacks in control over product and customer experience, it makes up for with permissionless composability, reusing the same social graph and efficiency UNIX-style 

concern/challenge: recalculating the state from past events based on different criteria will become more costly as time goes by - leading to ossification and inertia in changing the rules. Perhaps it should be done with a sliding window

Just because everybody can be a writer on public blockchains doesn’t mean that they should

Family/Community accounts? Dad/CEO owns the account of children/employees and can move them to a different IDM in a single tx? But what about the metadata leak?

> "Remember Snapchat's original Best Friends list? I'm going to guess many of my readers don't, because, as noted earlier, old people probably didn't play that status game, if they'd even figured out how to use Snapchat by that point. This was just about as pure a status game feature as could be engineered for teens. Not only did it show the top three people you Snapped with most frequently, you could look at who the top three best friends were for any of your contacts. Essentially, it made the hierarchy of everyone's “friendships” public, making the popularity scoreboard explicit.
>
> As with aggregate follower counts and likes, the Best Friends list was a mechanism for people to accumulate a very specific form of social capital. From a platform perspective, however, there's a big problem with this feature: each user could only have one best friend. It put an artificial ceiling on the amount of social capital one could compete for and accumulate.
>
> In a clever move to unbound social capital accumulation and to turn a zero-sum game into a positive sum game, broadening the number of users working hard or engaging, Snapchat deprecated the very popular Best Friends list and replaced it with streaks.
>
> If you and a friend Snap back and forth for consecutive days, you build up a streak which is tracked in your friends list. Young people quickly threw their heart and souls into building and maintaining streaks with their friends. This was literally proof of work as proof of friendship, quantified and tracked.
>
> Streaks, of course, have the wonderful quality of being unbounded. You can maintain as many streaks as you like. If you don't think social capital has value, you've never seen, as I have, a young person sobbing over having to go on vacation without their phone, or to somewhere without cell or wifi access, only to see all their streaks broken. Some kids have resorted, when forced to go abroad on a vacation, to leaving their phone with a friend who helps to keep all the streaks alive, like some sort of social capital babysitter or surrogate.
>
> What's hilarious is how efficiently young people maintain streaks. It's a daily ritual that often consists of just quickly running down your friend list and snapping something random, anything, just to increment the streak count. My nephew often didn’t even bother framing the camera up, most his streak-maintenance snaps were blurry pics of the side of his elbow, half his shoulder, things like that.
>
> Of course, as evidence of the fragility of social capital structures, streaks have started to lose heat. Many younger users of Snapchat no longer bother with them. Maintaining social capital games is always going to be a volatile game, prone to sudden and massive deflationary events, but while they work, they’re a hell of a drug. They also can be useful; for someone Snapping frequently, like all teens do, having a best friends list sorted to the top of your distribution list is a huge time-saver. Social capital and utility often can’t be separated cleanly." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Remember%20Snapchat%27s%20original,be%20separated%20cleanly.)

We want a new attractor which is: how do we utilize the new exponential technologies - the whole suite of them - to build new systems of collective intelligence, new better systems of social technology. How do you make a [fourth estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate) that can really adequately educate everyone in a post Facebook world? Well, the same way that we're trying to optimize control patterns of human behavior for market purposes to get them to buy certain things and to direct their attention, could that be used educationally? Of course it could, if it was being developed for that purpose. And the AI tech... could it take semantic fields of people's propositions and values and create a proposition that is kind of the semantic center of the space? We can't all fit into a town hall but can we engage in digital spaces where we can have better processes of proposing refinements to the propositions? Of course we can. Could we use blockchain and other types of uncorruptable ledgers to solve corruption which is something that universally everybody thinks is a good idea? Should all government money be on a blockchain - the movement of it - so you have provenance so you can see where the money's actually going and if someone wants to be a private contractor they have to agree that the accounting system - if they want government money - goes on the blockchain, so we can see the entire provenance of the taxpayer money. Really you can't have representation if there isn't transparency of how it happens. When you start to think about attention directing technology and what its pedagogical applications could be, when you start to think about AI and how it could actually help proposition development and parsing huge amounts of information to make a better epistemic commons, when you start to think about blockchain and could we actually resolve corruption using uncorruptable ledgers and making the provenance of physical supply chains and information and money all flow across those - totally new possibilities start to emerge that were never possible before." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/wO1WVguNQAM?t=4588)

> "So let's say we take the attention tech that you've looked at so much that when it is applied for a commercial application is seeking to gather data to both maximize time on site and maximize engagement with certain kinds of ads and whatever - that's obviously the ability to direct human behavior and direct human feeling and thought. In a way that is both emerged out of capitalism and has become almost a new macroeconomic structure more powerful than capitalism, because even more powerful than being able to incent people's behavior with money is being able to direct what they think and feel, to where the thing that they think of as their own intrinsic motive has actually been influenced or captured. So if we wanted to apply that type of technology and we figured out how to make the kind of transparency that made institutions that were trustworthy enough that we could trust them with this - and already we have institutions that have it that we have no basis to trust with it - could that same tech be used educationally, to be able to personalize education to the learning style of a kid or to an adult - to their particular areas of interest - and to be able to not use the ability to control them for game theoretic purposes, but use the ability to influence them, to even help them learn what makes their own center, their locus of action more internalized, right - we could teach people with that kind of tech how to notice their own bias, how to notice their own emotional behaviors, how to notice groupthink type dynamics, how to understand propaganda, media literacy. So could we actually use those tools to increase people's immune system against bad actors use of those tools? Totally. Could we use them pedagogically in general to be able to identify rather than manufacturing desires in people or appealing to the lowest angels of their nature because addiction is profitable, can you appeal to the highest angels and people's nature but that are aligned with intrinsic incentives and be able to create customized educational programs that are based on what each person is actually innately intrinsically motivated by, but that are their higher innate motivators? Everybody can have a reward circuit that is based on - you know - chocolate cake and sloth, but the immediate spike that comes from the chocolate cake ends up then having a crash and increased weight and inflammation and whatever, where the baseline of their happiness goes down over time - even though every time they eat the chocolate cake they get a spike. The exercise reward circuit is maybe not that fun - maybe even kind of painful and dreadful in the moment - but then creates a higher baseline of energy and capacity and endurance and self-esteem and you start to actually have the process become more fun, you get a new reward circuit, and the baseline goes up. So of course I can appeal to the lower reward circuit and say 'hey I'm just giving people what they want' - yeah but if you have a billion dollar or a trillion dollar organization that is preying upon them - and you discuss this very well all the time - the vulnerabilities that make people's life worse to then have the plausible deniability to say 'yeah but they wanted it' - yeah but it was a manufactured demand and a vulnerability - where's the noblesse oblige, where's the obligation of having that much power to actually be a good steward of power - a steward of that for other people - where if there are reward circuits that decrease the quality of their life, reward circuits that increase it, that we are trying to appeal to one rather than the other - could we do that? Yeah, totally we could. Could we have an education system as a result that was identifying innate aptitudes, innate interests of everyone and facilitating their development so not only did they become good at something but they became increasingly more intrinsically motivated, fascinated, and passionate by life which also meant continuously better at the thing - well in a world of increasing technological automation coming up - both robotic and AI automation where so many of the jobs are about to be obsoleted - our economy and our education system have to radically change to deal with that, because one of the core things an economy has been trying to do forever was deal with the need that a society had for labor force and there were these jobs that society needed to get done that nobody would really want to do, so either the state has to force them to do it or you have to make it where the people also need the job - so there's a symmetry and so kind of the market forces them to do it. Well when you technologically automate those jobs - and it happens to be that the things that are the most wrote are the least fun for people and the easiest to program machines to do - and so if you keep the same economy where if people don't produce they don't have any basic needs met, then people want those crappy jobs, right, but if you make it to where they have other opportunities - then of course having those jobs be automated is fine. But what does it mean to really be able to have other better opportunities? So if one of the fundamental axioms of all of our economic theories is that we need to figure out how to incent to labor force to do things that nobody wants to do and emerging technological automation starts to debase that - that means we have to rethink economics from scratch because we don't have to do that thing anymore. So maybe if now the jobs don't need the people, can we remake a new economic system where the people don't need the jobs? Can we start to create commonwealth resources that everyone has access to where people's access isn't based on possession that automatically limits everyone else's access? If you get around transportation wise with a car based on owning that car with the vast majority of the life of the car it's just sitting - not being used - for you to have access to the car you have to have possession of it, which means that it's a mostly under utilized asset - I don't have access to the thing that you possess. Now what we see with Uber of course is a situation where your access is not mediated by your possession. So now turn that into electric self-driving cars and now make the entire thing on a blockchain so you disintermediate even the central business, make it a commonwealth resource, and everyone has access to transportation as a commonwealth resource - it'll take a twentieth of the number of cars to meet the same level of convenience during peak demand time, so much less environmental harm - it'll actually be more convenient because I don't have to be engaged in driving the thing and there's less traffic because of coordination and better maintenance and there isn't an incentive for design and obsolescence in that system. You can see a situation where okay, can we make it to where the wealth augmenting capacity of that technological automation goes back into a commonwealth because we don't have to have the same axioms of needing to incent the people - 'oh yeah but if you don't incent the people they'll all be lazy welfare people' - nonsense. Einstein didn't do what he did based on economic incentive and neither did Mozart and neither did Gandhi and none of the people that we are most inspired by through history were doing that, and what kids who will spend so much time doing where they ask questions about why this, why this, why this, and building forts and whatever is intrinsic motive - it's just we don't facilitate the things that they're interested in - we try to force them to be interested in things they aren't interested in - that's what ends up breaking their interest in life and then they just want a hyper-normal stimuli and play video games, whatever. What if you had a system that was facilitating their interest the entire time? Now you have a situation where you can start to decrease the total amount of extrinsic incentive in the system as a whole, use the technology, the automation to decrease the need for extrinsic incentive and make an educational system and culture that's about optimizing intrinsic incentive, because if my needs are already met getting stuff and everybody's needs are met through access to commonwealth resources there's no real status conferred - there's only status confirmed by what I create. So now any status is bound to a kind of creative imperative. That's an example. We can look at blockchain tech even more near term and say... but just to come back to this technological automation thing: so obviously it makes possible changing economics and changing education, but also what is the role of humans in a post AI robotic automation world because that is coming very very soon, and what is the future of education where you don't have to prepare people to be things that you can just program computers to be - well the role of education has to be based on what is the role of people in that world. That is such a deep redesign of civilization because the tech is changing the possibility set that deeply. So at the heart of this are kind of deep existential questions of what is a meaningful human life and then what is a good civilization that increases the possibility space of that for everybody and how do we design that thing? We come back to blockchain and we say well blockchain is an uncorruptable ledger. Well one thing that the left and right and everybody agrees on is that corruption happens and it's bad for the society as a whole we don't like it - we just disagree on who does it. Is it possible that that tech could make possible decreasing corruption as a whole - it actually decreases the possibility set for corruption? Yeah - in order to do corruption I have to be able to hide that I did it - right - I either have to break enforcement or break accounting, and mostly it's break accounting. And so what if all government spending was on a blockchain and it doesn't have to be a blockchain - it has to be an uncorruptable ledger of some kind - Holochain is a good example that is pioneering another way of doing it - but uncorruptable ledger of some kind where you actually see where all taxpayer money goes and you see how it is utilized - the entire thing can have independent auditing agencies and the public can transparently be engaged in the auditing of it. And if the government is going to privately contract a corporation, the corporation agrees that if they want that government money, the blockchain accounting has to extend into the corporation, so there can't be - you know - very very bloated corruption. Everybody got to see that when Elon made SpaceX all of a sudden he was making rockets for like a hundreds to a thousandth of the price that Lockheed or Boeing were who had just had these almost monopolistic government contracts for a long time. Well if the taxpayer money is going to the government, is going to an external private contractor who's making the things for a hundred to a thousand times more than it costs, we get this false dichotomy sold to us that either we have to pay more taxes to have better national security, or if we want to cut taxes we're gonna have less national security. What about just having less gruesome bloat because you have better accounting and we make the rockets for a hundredth of the price and we have better national security and better social services and less taxes? Well, everyone would vote for that, right, who wouldn't vote for that thing. Well that wasn't possible before uncorruptable ledgers. Now that uncorruptable ledger also means you can have provenance on supply chains to make the supply chains close loop so that you can see that all the new stuff is being made from old stuff and you can see where all the pollution is going and you can see who did it which means you can now internalize the externalities rigorously and nobody can destroy those emails or burn those files. What if the changes in law and the decision-making processes also followed a blockchain process where there was a provenance on the input of information - well that would also be a very meaningful thing to be able to follow. So this is an example of like can we actually structurally remove the capacity for corruption by technology that makes corruption much much much harder, that forces types of transparency on auditability? What if also you're able to record history - you're able to record the events that are occurring in a blockchain that's uncorruptable where you can't change history later, so you actually get the possibility of real justice in real history and multiple different simultaneous timelines that are happening - that's humongous in terms of what it does. What if you can have an open data platform and an open science platform where someone doesn't get to cherry pick which data they include in their peer-reviewed paper - later we get to see all of the data that was happening - we solve the oracle issues that are associated, and then if we find out that a particular piece of science was wrong later we can see downstream everything that used that output as an input and automatically flag what things need to change - that's so powerful! Like the least interesting example of blockchain is currency creation. These are actual like... the capacity for the right types of accounting means the right type of choice making. Let's take AI - with AI we can make super terrible deep fakes and destroy the episemic commons, you know using that and other things like that, but we can see the way that the AI makes the deep fake - by being able to take enough different images of the person's face and movements that it can generate new ones, we can see where it can generate totally new faces averaging faces together - somebody sent me some new work that they were just doing on this the other day I found very interesting - they said we're going to take a very similar type of tech and apply it to semantic fields where we can take everybody's sentiment on a topic and actually generate a proposition that is at the semantic center, or take everybody's sentiment and abstract from it the values that they care about and create values taxonomies and say 'we should come up with a proposition that meets all these values'. Then can you have digital processes where you can't fit everybody into a into a town hall but everybody who wants to can participate in a digital space that rather than vote 'yes' or 'no' on a proposition that was made by a special interest group where we didn't have a say in the proposition or even the values it was seeking to serve, so it was made in a very narrow way that like we mentioned earlier - benefits one thing and harms something else - which is why almost every proposition gets about half of the vote and inherently polarizes the population. Well people are so dumb and so rivalrous the process of voting with bad propositions and bad representation process is inherently polarizing and downgrading to people. So what if there's a process by which there's a decision that wants to be made: you start by identifying what are the values everybody cares about and then we say 'the first proposition that meets all these values well becomes the thing that we vote on' and then instead of just a direct vote do we engage types of qualified and liquid democracy together where you have to show that you understand the basics of that topic to be able to vote on it, but the education is free and you can keep retesting, and the basics don't show leaning one way or the other - just shows you understand the stated pros and cons so that massive populism doesn't happen. But if you don't want to come to understand it you can cede your vote to someone else who has passed that thing. That type of liquid democracy, that type of qualified educated democracy where it doesn't have to be educated across everything - it can be per issue - and where you're not just voting on a thing - you're helping craft the propositions - these completely change the possibility space of social technology we could go on and on in terms of examples but these are ways that the same type of new emergent physical tech that can destroy the epistemic commons and create autocracies and create catastrophic risks could also be used to realize a much more pro-topic world." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/wO1WVguNQAM?t=4793)

> "One of the challenges of solving the multipolar trap internationally is the inability to make international agreements and one of the reasons where either we don't make the international agreement because it's not even worth making because we're sure they're going to defect on it so why even bother, or we make the agreement knowing that they're going to defect on it and we're going to defect on it but we're going to say that we're keeping it and we know they're going to say they're keeping it we're going to spy on them and we're going to lie to their spies and all this kind of waste that goes into that - if the transparency to know what they were actually doing and them to know what we were doing was there, the ability to make and keep the agreement would be fundamentally different. So underneath multipolar traps is the perverse game theory to orient towards opaqueness rather than transparency and this is - you know-  the whole nature of how many things are considered trade secrets in the market or national security secrets and - you know-  all of the different types of security clearance and classification and special compartmentalized information and whatever, because we're trying to have information advantage - information asymmetry advantage on the other side and we don't want them to know what we're doing but we do want to know what they're doing and so we invest a lot in this but the opaqueness means that the agreements can't be made so the multi-polar trap is the only thing that is left." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7618)

> "Does the ability to do attribution - specific verifiable attribution of where a particular harm is coming from - does that increase the capacity to create justice, to be able to bind it - totally. So is it possible that certain types of forced transparency can make it to where the ability to hide the harms that then have everyone race to do the harms goes away, and then the fact that they can be shown means there's a need to account for them and better methods of accountability emerge - I think there's a lot that can be done with forced transparency that orients towards a fundamentally better attractor of the game theory space." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7769)

> "Are there ways in which transparent solutions win game theoretically as a different peak in the adaptive landscape relative to the opaque solutions? Why the opaque solutions win is very obvious - surprise attacks help - the ability to advance something where they don't know that we're advancing it, we mislead them about it, they build a false defense - it's obvious why the desire for information asymmetry in that way is there. I was talking to someone in national security of Sweden who was telling me some very fascinating things and I haven't been able to verify all of them, but saying that of kind of the major nations that have meaningful defense capacities Sweden has maybe the most transparent intelligence and military and security apparatus, and their underlying philosophy was that the major players are going to be effective with their spying and know anyways - they don't really get that much information asymmetry - that's more of an illusion of control than a reality of it, and so Russia and China and the U.S. are going to know anyways, and so the huge amount of resource that they would have to put into trying to hide from them is mostly a waste - so they're just not even going to try, and that if you have to try to hide the national security stuff from the quote-unquote enemy that also means you have to hide it from your citizens because otherwise your citizens don't all know how to keep classification which is why this thing pretty much makes democracy impossible in any real sense more than just a simulation. At the time of the founding of modern democracies and particularly I'll mention the United States here, the United States had an ocean on both sides to anybody else, it had no kind of contiguous rival - land contiguous rival - that was a pretty awesome security situation, and so the decisions that needed to be made about anything - including military things - could be shared with the people, the people could actually weigh in on them, and sharing that information with those citizens didn't instantly mean sharing it with the British or the Spanish or anybody else because there was no way to get that information across the ocean quickly, and simultaneously once someone else got that information they couldn't launch an attack that quickly - they'd have to launch boats that we could see that would take months, it would give us time to launch a response, and so the ability to share with the citizens was actually viable in that world because of those sets of reasons. As soon as we get to a world where whatever is being shared with the citizens can be known by rival countries instantly, because of electronic telecommunications and where they can then launch attacks instantly - including ones that are hidden with plausible deniability like cyber attacks or economic attacks or geopolitical positioning, let alone missiles - now the threat of sharing information with the citizens meaning sharing with the rivals is way too high - therefore more and more things become classified more and more things become national security secrets - obviously attacks on our water supply or our energy grid or our food supply could all be national security threats, so we start finding that there's national security secrets fucking everywhere! Well how do you do democracy if the citizens can't actually know what is going on and what the real considerations are - well you can't - it's a simulation of it. This is a real challenge that we have to think of in a deep way when we consider what does a participatory governance system in the context of the modern world look like, because it makes sense that there would be a black budget and it makes sense that there would be national security secrets but then how do you verify that those authorities are not corrupt? How do you verify that they are actually doing the will of the people, or how do you create checks and balances on power or adjudicate issues or things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7838)

> "When we talk about what is a desirable civilization it becomes a really tricky topic because it's like centrally existential questions, to say what is a good civilization - we don't have a system like science - this is kind of the is/ought distinction where science can say what is but not what ought - we don't have a as powerful as sciences for being able to understand the objective world which then allows us to create objective tech that affects the objective world - we don't have a comparably effective way of studying the subjective and inter-subjective world of being able to say good, right, and so if you have the ability to affect the world exponentially more powerfully through science and applied sciences, technology, but you don't have a comparably powerful force for what is good or wise guidance of that technology then what is guiding that technology ends up being game theory, right, and game theory is actually like the closest thing to something that is commensurable with the scientific system in terms of what is a good choice which is kind of the social darwinism of a good choice as a choice that doesn't lose game theoretically to other choices that are also seeking maximum advantage, but we can see that the advance of game theory under the presence of exponential tech in this way self-terminates so that clearly cannot be called a good choice. And yet losing in the near term is also not a good choice so we need something that is option D - none of the above. So while I think it is important for us to become as good at the type of mind, at the type of internal human capacity that can do wisdom and ethics as we are at the capacity to do science and technology, and to be able to think about what is a desirable civilization, I think we can start by agreeing on a couple things that are not desirable - and I think that's actually very helpful. I think the idea that a civilization that self-terminates is probably doesn't meet the criteria of what an optimal civilization is so that we are wanting to prevent the movements towards cascading catastrophes - that seems pretty straightforward - and that one that is clearly dystopic - meaning that there are such radical asymmetries of power, that the freedoms of almost everyone are radically curtailed - is also not an ideal case. And yet it's very easy to see that exponential tech has the ability to decentralize power as the market cases giving an example of, which creates these coordination collective action problems and multipolar traps, and so the decentralized exponential power creates multipolar traps creates increasing catastrophes. So then it also has the ability to centralize power - if I could have an entire nation-state - historically the nation-state couldn't be too top-down and too big because it would get fragile because you can't actually see what everyone's doing and control it, but the ability to have sensors everywhere and no person could make sense of that and you couldn't even trust the chains of command but AI systems could, and then getting everybody to spy on each other is tricky but being able to mediate that through sesame credit type systems - it could do that thing. So the exponential tech also creates way more powerful autocratic systems at scale - centralizing power - which brings us back to why the multipolar trap is one of the very deep underlying things to work on. And this also brings us back to the Swedish example that I did not complete of where transparency could win. So the example he was giving is that rather than invest any resource in opaqueness or you know hiding or cloaking stuff they would just assume that the rivals would find out anyways and as a result they didn't have to keep stuff from their own population in the same way - as a result the population has a way higher trust in government, as a result way less money has to be spent in campaigning and convincing people of things and there's more kind of emergent coordination and things like that and the various departments of government - and especially of the military - have more transparency to what each other are doing because they're transparent, whereas in the classification you don't just have overarching classification - you have this kind of special compartmentalized information process which means that a general in one area and a general in the other still don't know what's going on in the other domain - so that both means that duplication can be happening, it means that a lack of efficiency of coordination happens, and that particularly when there's too much information it kind of doesn't even matter to have access to all the information because nobody can process it - this is the infosingularity issue and we'll talk about this more. But when we have more computational capacities to process large information sets then it actually really does matter having transparent access to all of it - we can make progressively better sense of it with the right computational sense making augmentation. So their ideas - the transparency regarding things that would have otherwise been classified - doesn't lose us that much - it gains us a lot of trust in government which gains us a lot of discretionary participation of the citizenry and it also gains us the ability for the various departments of government and military to be in much more coordination with less duplication and less waste because they have more transparency to what each other are doing, it also means that it's much easier to check corruption because they increase transparency and so you have more efficiency and integrity and things like that, and as a result you lose the little bit of asymmetry of information advantage but you gain a lot of other kinds of advantages so it's a different peak in the adaptive landscape. I thought this was fascinating when he shared this with me and so I asked - you know - that's cute and all as a country that has EU backing which fundamentally has NATO backing - you know - indirectly, and that is not at the head of an arms race - do you think something like that could work for say the United States? His take was yes - it actually could work for the United States because the amount of capacity uplift that would occur - and this didn't mean he thought it was inactive - the the vested interest against enacting it would be ridiculous - but just hypothetically as a thought experiment if that kind of transparency did happen - the amount of duplication that's occurring is huge, the amount of corruption and waste that's occurring is huge, the ineffectiveness of coordination that could be lifted would be huge, the ability to start getting increased trust in government and as a result having the democratic and government sector be more coherent, aligned with the military sector as opposed to the increasing discoherence in the government public sector, and that even if some first attack capabilities were increased because of the information sharing of other parties - that our total strategic capacity and response and deterrence would still make it or nobody would mess with that that such a thing could be advanced, and I think this is a fascinating line of inquiry. So if say, more total strategic military capacity emerged out of the transparency than the opaqueness approach - meaning per you know, military power per dollar - then it would actually drive a race to the top on transparency where Russia and China would be oriented to try to do a similar thing because otherwise they'd actually be losing the multipolar trap that is now a race to the top on transparency rather than a race to the bottom on opaqueness which is increasing the capacity for international agreement rather than decreasing the capacity and fundamentally addressing the multipolar trap progressively better. If we think about having some forced transparencies through things like international satellite capability and open source intel capacities that kind of mess up the opaqueness anyways - can we make the opaqueness increasingly poor as an adaptive strategy, the transparency both more forced and more capable of actually winning - now we start to get a strategy where for the first time in history possibly something wins game theoretically that is also better in fundamental ways regarding its long-term viability, that the culture more oriented to peacefulness can actually beat the culture more... warring without becoming more warring in all the most problematic ways - it can maintain adequate strategic capacity while being oriented in a way that fundamentally is decreasing the types of pathological competition within the system and as a result driving races to the top between systems of things that are more positive sum and less pathological as a whole. Ultimately whatever... I would say threading the needle of something that is neither catastrophes or dystopias and without being able to wave a magic wand and do enactment at the level of the whole world at once - if any group were to do something the thing they would do has to not lose to the rest of the world not doing that thing - not just not lose but it also has to influence the rest of the world because if let's say we could get some country to do some very enlightened set of practices it still dies from climate change and AI and whatever so long as it doesn't change what the U.S. and Russia and China and other places are doing, so it has to actually be able to influence the whole world shifting but it has to basically be able to win in some critical influence ways where the nature of what creates the win isn't externalizing harm or driving arms races or whatever. So it has to both be obsoleting some kinds of destructive game theory while winning at some fundamental types of game theory at the same time - like so much the threading of the needle has to occur. And I think when we go back to the sub dunbar tribes one of the things that mediated their effective protocols was that there was very high transparency which allowed for pretty good coordination and not having collective action failures within the group - there was no real incentive for anyone to be sociopathic or narcissistic because nobody would want sociopaths or narcissists in the system and unless you can like bullshit people and hide it - that strategy doesn't pay - if everybody can see that you're lying in a small tribal scenario or they can see that you put your trash down or didn't do your part of the chores you're going to clean it up or you're going to get kicked out of the tribe. So that the smallness creates a force transparency, creates a situation in which what is best for the tribe and what's best for you are more closely aligned - I'm not saying perfect, but more closely aligned. When the groups get much larger - where somebody has the ability to play people off of each other who don't know that that's happening because there aren't enough communication channels, and be able to screw some people over here and then go somewhere else to get a new supply of people and whatever, then of course the ability to hide the effects of what I'm doing - I'll create a incentive for sociopathy and things like that, which is why we see that those types of power-oriented say cluster B personality disorders are something like three times more prevalent in C-suites and positions of more power than they are in the general population - it is that they are adaptive in those environments so they're selected for, conditioned, and incentivized. So of course we can get the high transparency and thus better alignment between the individual agents' incentive and the whole in a small environment but that has never scaled." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=8380)

> "If we want to be able to scale it - are some of the new technologies that allow for certain kinds of transparency and then certain kinds of information processing across larger scale and communication? Could they facilitate better methods of collective intelligence that notice perverse incentives and as a result of noticing them and being able to create accounting for them, and externalities - be able to create accounting for them, create progressively better incentives, and more capable deterrence to align the motivations of individual agents with the whole better? I believe so. I believe that some of the exponential computational technologies in particular that portend the fastest and worst existential risks in many ways also portend the possibility for better coordination systems. And I'm not talking about AI disintermediating humans and having some AI singleton run the world - I think that's a really bad idea for lots of reasons. I'm talking about AI being able to facilitate human collective intelligence - AI amongst other capacities. Where I don't want artificial intelligence making the decisions by itself in most scenarios, I want processes of collective intelligence of humans making it, and we can get into obviously people voting yes/no on a binary proposition where both sides/versions of the proposition suck: if it goes through it benefits something and harms something else, if it doesn't go through the thing it would benefit is now harmed because the proposition was just designed stupidly to begin with - it didn't factor how interconnected everything was, so the yes/no on it can't not polarize the population. That's just a stupid system of collective intelligence. We can just do much much better: where before you make a proposition you actually do the sense making of what are all the interconnected things, what are all the values, you take those as design constraints to go through a better proposition crafting process of what is the best synergistic satisfier with the least theory of trade-offs possible, and what are better voting systems than binary that inherently polarize the population. So I think we can do a radically better job of systems of collective intelligence and a radically better job of education of people to be able to participate with these things, and an incentive system where as people become more educated in topics they actually get more ability to influence those topics. We could get into that - it's beyond the scope of this initial introduction. But one of the issues is that where there's more information that anybody can process - the information singularity: there's more journal articles on a topic than any expert can read so nobody can ever be an expert on anything - how do we solve that? One idea is we don't and we simply need AI's to run the world, the other idea is we have to be able to merge with the AIs through some kind of brain computer interface or something like that. I would say another version is that when you look at even the current state of generator AI which is really not advanced compared to what will be a year from now or five years from now because it's advancing so rapidly, but you look at the current state which would be say GPT-3 today (OpenAI) - it can use exclusively natural language input - I don't have to be able to program - I just speak to it, and it understands my words and it does stuff based on understanding the words - that's amazing! Go watch the DALL·E and the GPT-3 demos on YouTube to just get a sense of what they can currently do because it's mind-blowing and the only thing more mind-blowing is the speed at which it's advancing. The destructive capabilities of this don't take thinking very hard to imagine and they're very near-term. The beneficial cases but that are narrow are also really obvious. The omni-beneficial facilitation how do we create better collective intelligence and governance writ large is not as obvious until you really start to think about it but then it is amazing I feel. And this is not a techno optimist answer - I'm very acutely aware that the technology on the current trajectory is most likely catastrophic and what it takes to make the other version of it is value systems that have to be able to bind, guide, and direct it and influence social systems that create the capacity to bind, guide, and direct markets and technology in a way they don't currently have. But it is saying that the technology is new capacity and that that capacity if rightly directed does make new things possible. In the same way that the printing press made democracy possible where it wouldn't have been before because without any newspapers and without textbooks you can't have a comprehensively educated and informed society. When hand copying a book is so hard and expensive - only a nobility class with the wealth can have access to it. Of course that technology of the printing press did make possible different types of coordination than was possible before. Obviously the internet: anybody talked to anybody anywhere in the world & made possible different types of coordination, make possible and orient it to happen that way or different - while most people could use their phone to access any information in the world, what they end up doing on it is usually not that interesting examples because of the nature of the choice architectures that they're engaging with in their user interfaces, and the choice architectures are that the user interfaces that they engage with have goals for them that are other than that person's highest goals for themselves - and they're effective. So this is not AI will save the world, it's also not AI will necessarily destroy the world - this is a: since we have the power to create such powerful technology we need the orientation to think about what wise application of that technology is, and the intersection of comparable wisdom to guide, right, design, and development of that technology that in turn then is developing wisdom and everyone else based on their interface in the same way that Facebook can increase - and it's a known thing: you can change the algorithm that is affecting what's in people's newsfeed and they get more depressed or suicidal or more body image issues or not or because we're affected by what we untake - could we create information platforms that rather than doubling down on my existing bias were oriented to help expose me to information that is antithetical to the things that I currently think but in the most compelling cases so as to increase my kind of dialectical awareness, that rather than orient me to more people that are like the people I already know that orient me to people that are most unlike the people I already know to increase the total connectivity of my network, that rather than maximizing for things like my engagement and time on site it was maximizing for things like as I was showing the capacity to take and synthesize more perspectives the content that did that got upregulated in the algorithm, right, are there ways that that same type of technology could be applied that would be wisdom advancing? Of course this sounds scary because like who's idea of wisdom and who's going to control that, but it's important to get it's already doing it, right, it's already controlling minds at scale. So it's not a question of do we do it or not - it's how do we do it since it is happening. And now the core question of: well how do we adjudicate what is right use of the technology when you realize that the technology is not only radically affecting the earth physically, but radically affecting our mind, society's cultures. Now this again: the wisdom of gods to deal with the power of them becomes central. What is the right use of that? What are wrong uses? Where should that be bound? How do we understand this? How do we make sure that the binding a particular application of a problem doesn't make another worse problem? So we don't like a particular kind of partisan-led censorship, so we want more free speech, but if a particular approach to free speech also means a lot more ubiquitous deep fakes and an upregulation of the worst voices because they get the most tension that creates eliciting of violence and the breakdowns of democracy - it's like: okay, the obvious answers are all wrong, right, because the problem space is more interconnected and more complex, so we have to hold all those problem spaces together and think about it. But we come back to this: you know GPT-3-like AI type tech solving the info singularity - so when you put something to GPT-3 it's not going to find an existing web page for you the way that a search engine would - it can generate bespoke content, right, you can say "write me an article in the voice of such and such with it factoring these kinds of facts and orients towards this kind of conclusion and whatever" and it can do that! And progressively more and more effectively, more and more turing tests passing across more domains. Well what if that just becomes the future of search? Where if I'm searching for the information that could inform a particular choice we're wanting to make, or wanting to do something regarding grid security, but grid security - I need to know all the things about what really affects good security, and what other environmental and national security and you know et cetera issues are connected to that. Right now I can get billions of search results - I can't read billions of search results - that's not useful for me. Can the AI read billions of search results, find the information that is decision informing based on parameters that I'm specifying and create new bespoke content that is the synthesis of that for decision informing - not decision creating. The groups of people doing collective intelligence are still making the decisions, but now with the ability to take a synthesized or refined set of more information than they can process - that is pre-processed into decision-making information - now you say well fuck, who controls that algorithm because that's a big deal? What if you can do it lots of different ways? What if you can put different criteria for how to inform it and in the collective intelligence system all the agents have the capacity to do that kind of thing? There are heaps of challenges and problems that we have to solve here but this is an example of ways that coordination technology... The multi-polar trap is a coordination failure, it's a collective action failure, the dunbar number can be thought of as an upper boundary of a particular type of coordination capacity where everybody can know everybody and see what everybody's doing, talk to everybody, and so the collective activity is able to be bound through very high bandwidth communication. Once we start getting larger than that - early empires - we got command and control hierarchies and we started to get all the problems that we see in the world today, that are now - at the scale that we are - driving catastrophic risks. Democracies where how do we have a much larger system or rather than have somebody at the top rule whether it's one monarch or some small kind of nobility class or whatever - how do we at least have - since we can't get everybody at scale to agree - we could maybe get everybody at a tiny scale to agree but just a minority agreeing seems like a bummer. Can we at least get a majority to agree, but then of course that thing intrinsically ends up driving polarization and its own decay. And so can we make the types of transparency and the types of incentive alignment, the types of capacity for deterrence that would exist at a small tribal type scale possible at much much larger scales where the increase in effective coordination starts to be more effective, right, you start to reduce a huge amount of waste and duplication and failures of those kinds, and so what makes this thing adaptive and selective in a kind of game theoretic situation is also what makes it healthy in terms of the health of the people inside, in terms of classes - people relative to each other - and its relationship with the environment. I think that something like that has to be the answer and I think that it's interesting that the technologies that have the most destructive capability I think also have the most and uniquely facilitative capability for solving collective action or facilitating us solving collective action problems." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=9142)

> "If we were to talk about what is a third attractor: it's not going to be a top-down singleton which will end up being dystopic, it's not going to be many different actors caught in multiple traps with each other. It's going to be something where the system as a whole has the power to be able to check the catastrophic dynamics within it, but without having power consolidation itself - where the system has a kind of coordination across decentralized capacity, so centralized emergent coordination across lots of decentralized capacities. This is of course the idea of what democracy is trying to achieve and we can see why it was partially successful, and then why it failed and got captured under advancements of technology and complexity and financing like that. But can we build something with the very best of the knowledge and information technologies available to us now that makes coherent choice making that factors the total collective intelligence and total collective agency with the speed and coherence of what a small number of agents would have, and yet without any kind of centralized power? Well we can say that something like that is part of the criteria set of a third attractor of a desirable civilization that is not catastrophes or dystopias." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ZCOfUYrZJMQ?t=829)

> "I think there is a humongous amount of what we are perceiving about human behavior that is physiologically mediated a lot. And then also mimetically and culturally mediated, and I think the exploration of the full phase space of what could happen to both attenuate the negative contributors and advance all of the different positive contributors, and what the potential of the whole of that space is, is really profound. If we think about things like watching how quickly a technology like social media (like Facebook) can increase people's enmity towards their fellow citizens of the same country - to the point that both sides are oriented towards war - like so rapidly can vitriol and anger and whatever get stirred up as a result of just the media that people are being exposed to - out of the so much stuff what is being concentrated by the AI that's selecting for me. Could that same technology, curating with a different set of purposes, that was bias correcting rather than doubling down on bias, that was helping people connect to much wider networks rather than tribal networks, that was helping to up regulate more synthesizing and nuanced responses rather than other ones, could that affect culture and intelligence and disposition at scale in a way that no religious prophet could have ever dreamed of historically? Totally." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ZCOfUYrZJMQ?t=4869)

> "I hope the attractor of cascading catastrophes or control mechanisms that prevent it, but create dystopias, create a framework for what we want to avoid. And that a third attractor that has the intelligence and regulatory power to avoid the catastrophes while having checks and balances on itself to be non-dystopic, that the creation of a world system that can do that should be the kind of central innovation goal of the world - of which everything is an element or a subsidiary part, and that more total collective intelligence and innovation and motivation being focused on these issues is worthwhile. And I hope that rather than creating a sense of doom or overwhelm, that what this information might create is a sense of almost like a validation of something that has been intuited - an increased sense of clarity that makes the complexity of the challenge space at least start to feel tractable, and because if it is apprehendable, and if there are at least thought experiment-wise possible solutions, then there is a direction of endeavor, and to have more people feel that hopefulness that is not the naive hopefulness of not being aware of all these problems, but the hopefulness that comes on the other side of being aware of all of them and seeing what it would take to move through that, and be oriented to that - that's what I hope becomes of this." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ZCOfUYrZJMQ?t=6214)

> "This is exactly the centre of what I'm focused on: the problem is fundamentally the inability to coordinate between agents where their basis for agency intrinsically has deltas - right - there's a what's best for me in the current system of a private balance sheet and money and those types of things - what's best for me is not what's best for you and best for the commons - even though it would be over the long term, over the short term it doesn't seem to be. And so everyone is doing utility maximization functions but with again, unlike evolution, with asymmetric power relative to the environment and supply-side relative to demand side and things like that, and this then ends up creating a situation where it gets worse - like this is actually a very important point - if I have true information about the nature of reality, that is a source of strategic competitive information so I want to withhold that information (we call this a trade secret or classified or confidential information or intellectual property) but I don't just want to withhold that - I also want to make sure to throw anyone else that would figure it out off the scent trail so I want to do not just withholding of information but disinformation, and we have a situation where everyone is incented to do withholding of true information and signaling of disinformation, and then we have information technology that's exponential information technology where I can do customized disinformation for different persona types and all the way down to individuals - we get to a world where we stop being able to parse signal from noise because there's so much radical disinformation and we have a situation where a coordination actually becomes impossible because of these agency issues everywhere. It's supposed to be the two different intelligence agencies within a country perfectly coordinate with each other to support that country because they're all on team country, right, Team USA against the Russians and the Chinese and whatever, but really those two different intelligence agencies are also competing against each other for a larger percentage of the budget, and then even to different departments within that organization and even to different people competing for the same promotion will withhold information and maybe even disinform, engage in corporate politics - corporate politics is where someone's optimizing their own bonus structure and their fealty relationships at the expense of what's actually good for the whole because they're not actually coupled to the whole effectively - and so you get a situation of fractal defection - everybody defecting on everyone to some degree while signaling that they're not doing that - and this basically means a catastrophic breakdown in the sense making necessary to make good choices while having an exponentially increased amount of choice making power. And if we think about that, exponentially decreasing quality of sense making relative to the overall situation with exponentially increasing choice making power - that's another way to think about inevitable collapse." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=2330)

> "So why do we get so much concentration of sociopathy in the top of fortune 500 companies and politics and then especially things like finance? Well because they're basically systems to attract, reward, incentivize, and condition sociopathy, because to get to the top the power game it's going to be people who are attracted to power and people who are good at winning a bunch of win-lose games, because at each step they move up the ladder they're winning against somebody else - usually via involving things like disinformation and defection and whatever it is - and so if you think about the nature of what a government or a corporation or any top-down power system are - it is basically a strange attractor for people who want to have power over, for people who are running power dynamics, and this is why, you know, let's try and say that I have a benevolent dictator - well there's a reason that we don't get sustainable benevolent dictators is because let's say I have a benevolent dictator - and we can get this in a corporation from great founder Theory sometimes, because if the founder holds the you know, majority of stock or whatever, but it never out lives them, and usually they end up getting kicked out. So let's say I have a benevolent dictator. All the people who are one step under them are doing things that they require to be able to stay as a dictator because it's pretty easy to kill somebody or to oust them or whatever, so if I'm at the top of a top-down power system I have to keep everybody under me preferring me to be above them rather than overthrow me, which means that rather than do what's best for everybody I have to do what's best largely for those who are right near me, and they have to do that for those who are under them, and that ensures a kind of power law distribution of power and again there's like a multipolar trap on corruption - if anyone's willing to do a really fucked up thing to try and overthrow me, I have to be able to play at the game of fucked up things or I get overthrown. So we can see how top-down power systems are going to both attract, condition, reward, incentivize things like sociopathy and so then we end up having a world run by sociopaths which is not a good thing for anybody. But now let's think about something like a tribe - and I'm not gonna over romanticize here, I'm just kind of thinking through the dynamics in a first principles way - if I've got 40, 50, 70, up to a Dunbar number of people living in a tribe there's an extraordinarily high degree of transparency that is forced in that scenario - everybody pretty much sees everything that's going on with everybody and everybody knows everyone, everyone has fealty relationships with everybody in the tribe. So sociopathy is not gonna be advantageous - you're not going to have an evolutionary niche in that environment for much in the way of conspiring and lying, because it will get found out and it will get punished, and so the forced transparency creates an accounting system where you don't get an evolutionary niche for somebody fucking the other people in the system. And so as soon as the system starts to get large enough that 1) there's anonymous people so I can harm people who I don't really know and care about as opposed to everybody who is in the system as somebody that I know and care about, and 2) I can do stuff that people won't be able to see I can kind of have a corruption of the accounting in the system - now we get an evolutionary niche for rather than participating with the system - doing internal defection. I'm not externally defecting and leaving the system - I'm internally defecting and playing the system. And that's what most everyone inside of a corporation or a government is optimizing - what is good for them and their direct fealty relationships rather than what's good for the whole, and nobody can tell. And this is a particularly hard scenario, but the reason I'm saying this is because we do our social science inside of a world where these systems have become ubiquitous, and then we assume that those properties where there's ubiquitous conditioning, are intrinsic to human nature and I think we have to be very careful about that - I think a lot of them are not intrinsic to human nature - they are a result of the ubiquitous conditioning and we could create conditioning environments in which things like sociopathy are just not advantageous and so they don't get up regulated." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=3104)

What if radical transparency and cooperation for companies gave them an effectively free marketing budget (they'd be upregulated by the network) and also contributions from everywhere - like with open source? They still price in the labor and input costs, but there's no need for a marketing budget?

What if we made advertising in its current form obsolete? What if false claims were not allowed? What if demand could not be manufactured? What if we had an immune system?

> "Let's say that I'm one of the richest people in the world today - I'm Bill Gates or Warren Buffett or whatever - there's really important stuff that the world could produce that it can't inside of capitalism that I don't have access to and this is actually kind of everywhere and it's really basic: the best phone the science could make involves some intellectual property owned by Apple and some owned by Google and some owned by a few different companies and the same is true with the best laptop and the best car and even with billions of dollars I can't buy that thing. And all the things that I can buy are produced by someone where not only do they have limited IP but they also have whatever designed obsolescence and desire for proprietary stuff so you use the rest of their ecosystem stuff so it's not interoperable - I have to deal with that shitty suboptimality even from the richest guy in the world." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=4122)

> "What could provide increased capacity that can't be weaponized? That's a very interesting question. We could say that every technology that increases capacity can be weaponized - meaning: can be used by some agent to increase their capacity relative to other agents or the commons. Except if we had a social technology that was anti rivalrous, but it actually produced increased coordination capacity - you actually can't weaponize it because it is the solvent for weapon ization itself. It is actually the basis of how agents interact in a way that doesn't incentivize weapons and so for anyone to instantiate that thing they are actually changing the nature of their agency. So in the current system, again, private balance sheet, I'm in a big corporation, I'm gonna do the thing that optimizes my bonus structure and my status in the company - even if it fucks other people in the company and the company as a whole and that might include spreading disinformation, withholding information, etc. Well let's say I could create a situation where I couldn't get ahead of the expense of the whole so I had both the right kind of transparency and accounting systems and access to Commonwealth resources where only as the Commonwealth does better do I do better and things like that. Then we can have a situation where no one... Let's just say if we could invent a situation in which no one had an actual incentive to spread disinformation or to hoard information, if they shared true information - maybe they'd be wrong but they at least had the incentive for full earnestness and full transparency - if you had a situation where that was the incentive - you figured out how to do that - and I will say there is a way to do that, I believe there's a way to do that - then you would get a situation where you had an information ecology that was actually intact at a larger scale. That would lead to radically better capacity to coordinate and innovate - better sensemaking than the current system has - in that system as a whole would be more effective at producing all of the metrics that matter relative to total resource per capita than any current system would be. And I only need a small number of people - relatively small number of people - who get that and want to instantiate it as a new full stack civilization to create a new strange attractor or a new attractor basin, where anyone else looking at it says 'Well quality of life is higher on every metric there and they're also able to innovate us on a bunch of things, they're figuring out solutions to that we don't have, well then why don't we just kill them? Well because they aren't trying to win the game of power against us, they aren't building militaries or signaling or narrative warfare to try and beat us, and actually they're exporting solutions to us that we need to the rest of the world, because if they have increased capacity to innovate and solve problems, because they can actually coordinate better, because they don't have disinformation information withholding' - then they can look at what groups that would otherwise have enmity with them actually need - develop those solutions and create dependents rather than enmity relationships while simultaneously saying 'If you want to know how to do this as well, we've actually open sourced it - it's a social technology, you're welcome to use the social technology' - but the social technology will fundamentally change your basis for agency if you employ it. So obviously there's a million things we would need to dig into there, but just the thought experiment goes: fast adopters build a new ground-up system where the new ground-up system becomes a new attractive basin and - you know - that's a way of thinking about that I don't try and... If I have to shift at the level of axioms I can't retrofit current system - I have to build something, but if the thing that I build is fundamentally more attractive ground up, then I only need fast adopters to understand it in concept to have medium adopters understand that after seeing its implementation." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=4517)

> "Whenever something becomes the legitimate authority on truth for a topic it's extraordinarily powerful because what everyone else thinks is real, which is the basis of how they're going to behave, is actually like at the bottom of the stack of power. And so even if a legitimate authority emerges rightly - because it's actually earnest and doing better empiricism and whatever - as soon as it starts to get that power there will be maximum incentive for all of the power players to try to corrupt it and influence it in various ways, which they usually can because which science is going to get funded is going to be based on someone who has funds putting money into something that will continue to support or advance them having funds. And so even if, say, a piece of science is technically accurate - it's not wrong - it might be that only certain topics within a domain that have ROI more associated get funded - other ones don't, like for instance you know, patentable small molecules and pharma compared to peptides or biologics or plant-based things. And so then the preponderance of research doesn't actually map to the overall space well, so even things that are true can still be misrepresentative or misleading - so this problem that legitimate authority within an economic game theoretic environment will always get captured or influenced to various degrees and so how do we address that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=1890)

> "We need to have governance - I'm going to separate governance as a process and government as an established top-down enforcement of rule of law with monopoly of violence. We need to have governance at the level that we're having effects - meaning we have to be able to actually make sense of the effects we're having and factor that into the choices that we're making, and when we have planetary effects on the atmosphere and the ocean and etc. but we don't have planetary governance, then we just get multipolar traps where okay, we don't want to fish all the fish out but if we can't make an agreement that China or somebody else is going to also follow and they're going to get ahead economically and the ocean's still going to get ruined then they're going to use that economic benefit to damage us - not only will we not make an agreement to manage the commons - we actually have to race to fish all the fish out faster than they do, or make AI weapons faster than they do, or whatever else it is that's exploitive. And so not having global governance when we're having global effect leads to catastrophe, but having global government of the types that have only ever become corrupted and then as a result broke down also leads to catastrophe. And so we need something that is different than either of those things that have been imagined so far." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2035)

> "Very few civilizations since the beginning of civilization until now have been republics or democracies - they've almost all been feudalistic or autocratic of some kind and that actually makes sense, because one guy ruling everything or some very small number of people that can talk, coming up with a consensus, and then being able to rule is way easier than getting a huge number of people - mostly who are anonymous to each other - to all actually be able to make sense of the world and coordinate. Like a large number of people coordinating is actually a very expensive tricky thing, and from the way I see it, throughout history the few times democracies emerged - they emerged following cultural enlightenments that had a few things in common. When we look at the Athenian democracy coming out of the Greek enlightenment: stoicism plus the Aristotelian school and - you know - a few things had caught on to the place where they had a cultural value around education, that everyone would learn formal logic and everyone would learn rhetoric and history and - you know - those types of things, plus the kind of stoic culture where they're all learning emotional regulation and the socratic method where they're learning how to take each other's perspectives, debate any side of a conversation. Well if I have a bunch of people who are trained to be able to assess base reality clearly on their own, they have emotional regulation so they are not as susceptible to emotional and cognitive hijacks and groupthink and have the courage to disagree and things like that, and they can take each other's perspective and they're actively seeking to - well those are the prerequisites to something like a democratic system being able to emerge because those people can have a good quality conversation about shared sense making, recognize that some compromises to agree are better than warfare with each other and come up with solutions, so collective choice making emerges out of the collective sense making, meaning making and conversation ability. And our country similarly coming out of the post-european renaissance enlightenment phase was - you know - the idea of renaissance men, renaissance people who could have expertise across a lot of topics - not just be specialists - because specialists across different domains have a hard time being able to communicate really effectively towards governance that requires looking at a lot of those things, but the idea that we could become renaissance people, that we could all have empirical capacity, the scientific method, and the hegelian dialectic - that we could hear a view and then seek the antithesis to that thesis and then seek a synthesis - some higher order reconciliation - that again gives rise to the possibility of participatory governance. And you can see when you read the documents and the letters of the founding fathers - and of course there was a lot wrong with the Athenian democracy and a lot wrong with our country that had genocide and slavery as parts of its origin, but the whole world had genocide and slavery as parts of what were going on at the time and it was at least moving in the direction of increasing participatory style governance - the thing that the founding fathers talk about so much is the need for very high quality universal public education and very high quality fourth estate that's independent - or news as the prerequisites of democracy. George Washington said - I'm not going to quote exactly - it's something to the effect of that the single most important goal of this government should be the comprehensive education of every single citizen in what he called the science of government, and I think the science of government is such an interesting phrase because we've separated science and the humanities so formally, and the science of government would be history and game theory and political theory and the things that people need to know the shenanigans that happen so that they can prevent them, and Franklin said 'If I could have a government without news or news without a government - I would take news' because if the people really know what's going on they can self-organize and overthrow government - if the people don't know what's going on they can only be captured. And our public education or education of any kind here in the kinds of civics that people would need to really understand what's happening in government and understand regulatory capture and be able to bind it obviously is close to non-existent and the news has been mostly captured by economic and political interests, so there is no chance for a bunch of people that identify as being in almost tribal warfare with each other, who aren't sense making reality well, who don't understand governments, who don't really understand markets, who only have pejorative strawmans of each other and don't seek each other's opinion - those people can't do a republic or democracy, so it will simply devolve back to an autocracy which we see happening. And the way I think of it is like: if there's a bodybuilder who has a huge amount of muscle - the moment they stop working out they start losing it, because it's very expensive metabolically to keep that much muscle - they have to kind of keep working at it - it's very expensive to keep an entire population comprehensively educated and actively engaged. And once it seems like the government's working well and a generation passes and the kids didn't go through the pain of the revolutionary war and the grandkids didn't - it becomes very easy to just get engaged in your own stuff and not keep participating in the governance and then you stop having a government of, for, and by the people - and you start having a class of people that do government, and when the people stop checking the state - the state stops being able to check the predatory aspects of the market, which is what it's really intended to do - and then the market ends up capturing it - you get regulatory capture, and then rather than liberal democracy you get a kleptocracy that eventually becomes an autocracy. And that's what I see that we have right now - and so do I trust any particular authority to arbitrate truth or good faith or whatever right now - no. Do I trust a collective intelligence that's actually increasing in its authentic intelligence - I would trust that much more - it's an expensive hard proposition, but I don't see any other good choices." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2335)

> "So partly it has to do with scale - for sure - which is... the founding fathers thing here - there was an idea that everybody could go to the town hall and discuss the issues that were mostly geographically close to them, that everyone could sense base reality on their own, and you could have a small enough number of people in the town hall that for the most part the people who had something to say could actually say something about it. And when we moved to a place of most of the issues are globalized - whether we're talking about finance or supply chains or environmental issues or - you know - geopolitical ones - obviously that's a level of complexity where people can't depend on their own base sense making and they can't process that much information and second and third order effects and confounding effects as well. And one topic I'll just enter here because we haven't discussed it yet is the concept of hyper objects, which is connected to but a little bit distinct from just raw complexity, that we evolved to be able to apprehend and understand objects that were available to our senses, and when I'm talking about something like climate change - I can't see climate change, I can't taste it, I can't hear it - I can only conceptualize it, I can see a drought, I can see a fire - there have always been droughts and fires, but to understand climate change I have to think about some kind of statistics and complex mathematical models on the droughts and the fires. I also can't see world hunger - I can see a hungry person somewhere, but I can't actually directly apprehend - I can only do it conceptually, which also means I don't have the same felt visceral experience of the things, and the same is true with I can't actually directly see or apprehend AI risk or biotech risk or nanotech risk or or the nature of markets, and so we have a world where the most influential things are mostly all not apprehendable to the senses, and so we have not just the issue of can we have a better felt sense or our intuitions are more right, that our kind of sensibility of what's likely true as well as our kind of formal analytic thinking - can we get hyper objects but then can we get the connection of lots and lots of hyper objects - markets interacting with social media environments,  interacting with climate, and things like that - and I think it's just important to kind of state that, to have a sense of how different the problem space of the things that we need to understand and think about are now compared to the evolutionary problem space most people had to think about, and how different the kinds of collective sentence making need to be and choice making need to be, and then I'll also step back and say even in environments where we weren't dealing with as much in the way of complexity and hyper objects - our sense-making was actually usually still adequate to solve local problems in ways that very often caused other problems somewhere else or down the road - and this is an important part of understanding this is like the model that we can look at all of our problems as a result of either conflict theory or mistake theory - conflict theory meaning we know we're going to cause harm somewhere and we're doing it anyways for game theoretic purposes, mistake theory as you were mentioning with Facebook we didn't know this was going to happen and it was simply an unintended externality. So we have to deal with both moving forward - how do we remove the basis of conflict theory so no one is motivated to do things that will knowingly harm something else and how do we also deal with the mistake theory of being able to anticipate externalities and internalize them into the design processes better, and so the mistake theory side - you can go back to - we didn't necessarily know that the development of stone tools would lead to us becoming apex predators that were increasing our predatory capacity faster than the environment could become resilient, that led us starting to extinct species at scale and then become the apex predator in every environment and start the anthroposcene, or you can come to a closer one and say when we were making the internal combustion engine to solve the problem of the difficulty of horse husbandry pulling buggies - we didn't anticipate that in solving the horse husbandry problem that we'd be causing climate change and oil spills and wars over oil and the U.S. petrodollar, and so typically if we're going to make a solution that solves a problem - the solution has to be somehow bigger than the problem, faster, whatever - to be able to scale and overtake it to really solve the problem, but if we define the problem in a narrow way - there's one or two or some small number of metrics - and the solution we're trying to create has a first order effect on a small number of known metrics, but it might have second and third order effects on a very large number of unknown metrics - we can see that the safety analysis is actually harder in kind than the solution analysis and this is something that we actually have to start factoring - I don't just need to understand the problem I'm trying to solve - I have to understand the problem embedding landscape of the adjacent problems and the adjacent topics and the adjacent meaningful things and I have to start thinking through second and third order effects better - whether I'm designing a proposition or designing a piece of technology or designing a company to solve a problem - to say if that solution's effective, what other things is it likely to do and what harms could that cause to complex environments and then how do we actually factor that into the design process." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2937)

> "Before we discuss a perfected system we can just discuss how to stop some of the most egregious things about the current system. Current system - people are radically certain about things that they have no basis to be certain about and it's actually their false certainty that causes most of the problems - if they simply acknowledge that it was too complex and they didn't know - they at least wouldn't be going to war over dumb stuff, and to so to simply be able to have people be like 'I don't know yet but I'm interested and I'm gonna try to seek to know better' would actually slow the rate of breakdown tremendously." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=3412)

> "Do I think that we can get the hierarchical complexity or the ability of people to process information up? Yes. Even before that - if I can start getting them a memetic immune system to where they aren't just cognitively and emotionally hijacked - right now it's mostly not even 'can they do good epistemology' - it's that they're just captured by narrative warfare - if I can simply get a memetic immune system where people start to notice how [Russell conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation) and [Lakoff framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphorical_framing) happens - yes that scientific article said something, but the news article put spin on it - can they notice how the spin's occurring? Yes that's a true statistic but it's cherry picked - when you look at all the other statistics it doesn't look like that same picture at all. And people start noticing those kind of info and narrative weapons and become inoculated enough that it's not like absolute lowest common denominator collective intelligence - that will make a huge shift, so we have to factor the kind of memetic emotional immunity and cognitive immunity topic, then better epistemology for the individuals and better orientation towards socratic dialogue, hegelian dialectic - like seeking shared understanding because of understanding the need to coordinate being less bad than warfare & not coordinating. Then I think we start to get emergent collective intelligence where more sovereign and intelligent people and better conversations start to produce systems of coordination to bottom-up effect where those systems of coordination produce a top-down effect that continues to incentivize that bottom-up effect better and you get a recursive process between better systems of collective sense making and choice making and better development of individuals and their communication capacity with each other." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=3993)

> "As much as a lot of people think that we're too aware of our problems and we just need to focus on solutions - I actually think that it's a very deep misunderstanding of the real nature of our problems - that is one of the keys. People think the problem is climate change or the problem is systemic racism or whatever the thing is that they're focused on, but what are the generative dynamics that give rise to it and how is it interconnected with the other issues in the world where if you try to change it in a particular way it will externalize harm elsewhere and or fail? So the problem isn't climate change or U.S. China relationships or GDP or it's how all those things fit together and the system incentives of the underlying systems." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/JBU06Wswc7c?t=1267)

> "Think about the scale of the market for a minute - you have something like a 100 trillion dollars exchange hands every day and as has been made clear, all of that involves energy that is involving mining and fracking and extraction and pollution on the other side. Even the services sector depend upon products so all of it has a materials footprint. It all requires central banks, it all requires militaries - nobody gets to make money in that contract hold without the military that holds the monopolies of violence and everything in place that keeps that economic system going. So all of those dollars - the taxes - they pay and whatever are supporting that whole system. So Norrsken is one of the probably larger impact companies around and if you have whatever - a few hundred million dollars to invest - and we're talking about a 100 trillion dollars a day of activity that is right up at planetary boundaries and at the verticalizing part of the exponential tech curve - how do you leverage any activity to be able to affect 100 trillion dollars a day no longer being harm externalizing? That's a question we have to take really seriously. But so that's the size of the economy today and it's obviously growing exponentially just to keep up with interest and if we didn't grow exponential you wouldn't keep up with interest the financial system as we know it would collapse. So we have a financial system - how we meet our basic needs depends upon - that is so obviously incompatible with the biosphere - what the fuck we did - it was so ridiculous. But so what is the market? Think of it as: money is a kind of token for value, it's a kind of token for game theoretic optionality where it has no intrinsic value but it has a maximum optionality to get me any type of value I want - I can get militaries with it, I can get media influence, I can change people's minds, I can get materials, and because I don't know how the environment is going to change - the speed of adaptive response is the most important thing - the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) - the speed at which I can respond to the environment - so I don't want a lot of materials that might become less useful, I want a lot of optionality to have whatever I want. So if you think of money as a proxy for value, but only value that is measurable, extractable, and exchangeable - and all the types of value that on your deathbed you'll really care about are not measurable extractable and exchangeable - we'll destroy all those types of value in the pursuit of these types and we have to because they are. So now think about that as a decentralized incentive system that is incenting all the 8 billion humans to figure out how to get it because everything else they want requires it and everything they need to exist requires it - the countries relative to each other, the companies relative to each other, the people relative to each other, and so it incents them to innovate and it incents them to act on existing innovation - so search algorithms and optimization algorithms. So you can think of the global market as something like an AI in an intelligent system that is running parallel process on human compute - on human beings - and you know how radically powerful parallel process in the cloud is - being able to run a lot of parallel process on computers did a lot more than centralized supercomputers could do - so this is running parallel process on 8 billion human beings and the clusters of corporations and countries and whatever to incentivize them all to search new ways to make money and to optimize on existing ways and whoever gets good at that system gets more power in it and in turn lobbies and changes laws and changes cultural values of the media they create and whatever that makes a system better for them, and anyone that opposes that system is also opposing those who are doing well at it so that there is agency to suppress that. So the you can think of the global market as a misaligned super intelligence that is already misaligned with planetary well-being in humans that is running on all the humans while also running all the humans that also uses all the compute and all the other technology and that is building all of the narrow AIs in its own service. We said that most of the Nazis weren't Hitler. So the Hitler we're all in relationship to today is this thing - we can call it Moloch, you can call it the superorganism, you can call it the mega machine and that thing has to die. That thing has to die or the biosphere will die. But it's not actually animate - it is running on and made up of human action. So thinking about what would it take to - it has to die and/or be converted to something that it is not." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/4kBoLVvoqVY?t=1614)

> "You take any of the biggest issues in the world - like the issues that could determine whether or not we keep existing as a species - so take big environmental issues like climate change: there's disagreement as to whether climate change is really even a thing, and to the extent that it is a thing - what the causes are and what the time scales are. Now, most people who believe fervently 'no, climate change is real, 97% of climate scientists agree, it's anthropogenic, greenhouse gases, etc.' - most of the people that believe that fervently enough to kind of like go into narrative warfare for it have never actually looked at the primary data deeply themselves. And yet there's an almost religious fervor around it that was based on having proxied their sense making to people who they believe. So the UN said it or the Gates Foundation said it or whatever it is - I've heard it repeated enough times - just through repeatability: I have been programmed to believe this thing is true, which is not that different than believing a fundamentalist religious idea. And let's say we take people's fervent ideas on vaccines or their fervent ideas on the viability of market ideology or almost anything like that - almost no one who has fervent ideas has a good epistemic basis for the level of certainty they hold. There's a decoupling between how much certainty they have and how much certainty they should have through right process. And then you look at who are they proxying their sense making to - in most the time they're not even proxying their sense making to the people who did the original research, many of whom disagree with each other and were funded by somebody to say something that is not fully true in the first place, and who maybe were employing epistemic biases themselves. But typically it's somebody else who looked at all of that and then someone else who looked at all of that so you might have like a bunch of climate scientists into someone who is speaking about that as a climate scientist at a more synthetic level - like a James Hansen or whatever - to then like a Gore or someone who is actually speaking to the public who we're proxying our sense making to. And we say 'okay how many steps removed is it and how good was the original data?'" - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/7LqaotiGWjQ?t=2276)

> "The idea of democracy is that it is participatory governance. So you notice that the modern democracies emerged out of the European Enlightenment, and specifically because the idea that a lot of people - some huge number - not a tribal number - huge number of anonymous people who don't know each other, are not bonded to each other, who believe different things, who grew up in different ways, can all work together to make collective decisions well that affect everybody and where some of them will make compromises in the thing that matters to them for what matters to other strangers - that's actually wild, like it's a wild idea that that would even be possible. And it was kind of the result of this high enlightenment idea that we could all do the [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science) and we could all do the [hegelian dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) - those ideas had emerged, right, and it was that we could all... So our choice making - because we said a society is trying to coordinate choice making - the emergent order is the order of the choices that we're making - not just at the level of the individuals but what groups of individuals - corporations, nations, states, whatever do. Our choice making is based on our sense making and our meaning making. Our sense making is what do we believe is happening in the world and what do we believe the effects of a particular thing would be, and our meaning making is what do we care about, right, our values generation - what do we care about that we're trying to move the world in the direction of. If you ultimately are trying to move the world in a direction that is really really different than the direction I'm trying to - we have very different values - we're going to have a hard time. And if you think the world is a very different world, right, if you think that systemic racism is rampant everywhere and one of the worst problems and I think it's not even a thing, if you think climate change is almost existential and I think it's not even a thing - we're going to have a really hard time coordinating. And so we have to be able to have shared sense making of can we come to understand just what is happening together and then can we do shared values generation: *'okay maybe I'm emphasizing a particular value more than you but I can see how I can take your perspective and I can see how the thing that you value is worth valuing and I can see how it's affected by this thing, so can we take all the values and try to come up with a proposition that benefits all of them better than the proposition I created just to benefit these ones - it harms the ones that you care about, which is why you're opposing my proposition'*. We don't even try in the process of crafting a proposition currently to see - and this is the reason that the proposition when we vote on it gets half the votes - almost all the time - it almost never gets 90% of the votes - is because it benefits some things and harms other things. We can say *'all theory of tradeoffs'* but we didn't even try to say *'could we see what everybody cares about and see if there was a better solution'*. **LEX:** How do we fix that try - I wonder is it as simple as the social technology of education? **DANIEL:** Well no, it's that the proposition crafting and refinement process has to be key to a democracy or paratory governance, and it's not currently. **LEX:** But isn't that the humans creating that situation? So... there's two ways to fix that: one is to fix the individual humans which is the education early in life, and the second is to create somehow systems that... I understand the education part, but creating systems - that's why I mentioned the technologies is creating social networks essentially. **DANIEL:** Yes, that's actually necessary. Okay so let's go to the first part and then we'll come to the second part. So democracy emerged as an Enlightenment era idea that we could all do a [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) and come to understand what other people valued, and so that we could actually come up with a cooperative solution rather than just *'F you we're going to get our thing in war'*, right, and that we could sense make together - we could all apply the philosophy of science and you weren't going to stick to your guns on what the speed of sound is if we measured it and we found out what it was and there's a unifying element to the objectivity in that way. And so this is why I believe Jefferson said if you could give me a perfect newspaper and a broken government or - I'm paraphrasing - or a broken government & perfect newspaper - I wouldn't hesitate to take the perfect newspaper because if the people understand what's going on they can make build a new government. If they don't understand what's going on they can't possibly make good choices. And Washington - I'm paraphrasing again - first president said the number one aim of the federal government should be the comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government. Science of government was the term of art - think about what that means, right, science of government would be [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), coordination theory, history - it wouldn't be called game theory yet - history, sociology, economics, right - all the things that lead to how we understand human coordination. I think it's so profound that he didn't say the number one aim of the federal government is rule of law, and he didn't say it's protecting the border from enemies, because if the number one aim was to protect the border from enemies it could do that as military dictatorship quite effectively, and if the goal was rule of law it could do it as a dictatorship - as a police state. And so if the number one goal is anything other than the comprehensive education of all the citizens in the science of government it won't stay democracy long. You can see - so both education and the fourth estate - the fourth estate being... so education: can I make sense of the world, am I trained to make sense of the world, the fourth estate is what's actually going on currently - the news - do I have good, unbiased information about it. Those are both considered prerequisite institutions for democracy to even be a possibility. And then at the scale it was initially suggested here - the town hall was the key phenomena where there wasn't a special interest group crafted a proposition and the first thing I ever saw was the proposition, didn't know anything about it and I got to vote Yes or No - it was in the town hall we all got to talk about it and the proposition could get crafted in real time through the conversation, which is why there was that Founding Father statement that that voting is the death of democracy - voting fundamentally is polarizing the population in some kind of sublimated war, and we'll do that as the last step, but what we want to do first is to say how does the thing that you care about that seems damaged by this proposition - how could that turn into a solution to make this proposition better, where this proposition still tends to the thing it's trying to tend to and tends to that better - can we work on this together - and that in a town hall we could have that. As the scale increased we lost the ability to do that. Now as you mentioned the Internet could change - that the fact that we had representatives that had to ride a horse from one town hall to the other one to see what the colony would do - that we stopped having this kind of developmental propositional development process when the town hall ended - the fact that we have not used the Internet to recreate this is somewhere between insane and aligned with class interests." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/hGRNUw559SE?t=12435)

> "When you say casually "I don't know what I'm seeing" - you don't mean that there are no words in your head to describe it, you mean you literally can't make sense of what you're seeing. So sense making goes beyond words - it goes to like things like pattern recognition, it goes to a literal gut feeling of confusion or clarity, and so on. These are very basic human experiences and the scaling of these basic human experiences is what helps you produce a dynamic coherence to society. So a society that has sense making does not need to just you know follow the leader's gut feeling - it in fact has something of a shared correctly constructed gut feeling versus one that is to a significant extent very chaotic, oppositional, no premise is followed up by a conclusion, no incorrect premise is ever disproven, you say A on monday - B on tuesday, A is more viral, the virality is rewarded - not the correctness. That's the problem. If you wish to have a somewhat free society the sense making has to be participatory, which means that different levels of society can correct each other, different centers of society can correct each other, and they're even able to find this like commonality of speech and so on. Then there's the question of meaning - how do we evaluate things, do we find meaning in them or do we not find meaning in them, what is motivating us even? The sense of enemy often comes with not just a loss of sense making - there are many people in fact who have fairly coherent world views, they even share these worldviews with others but they're fundamentally depressed, and one of the reasons they're often fundamentally depressed is because of the question "So what?" - you said how it is, tell me how it should be. Or rather "I know how it is but I don't know how it should be". And then finally there's the question of choice making and how are decisions between different possible futures made - again both for individuals and society as a whole. The sort of simple solution is that you have a single center that tries to make decisions. The other alternative is sort of anarchy - there are no real decisions made anywhere, and the ideal coherence is that society builds these decisions together through something like a discourse, something like a deliberative process, where deliberative doesn't just merely mean voting - it goes much beyond voting - it is the shared building of the model of the world and the "what about it" & "so what do we do about it" and finally the details of the implementation." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/bHCg8bhtbqs?t=1530)

Is there any organ of the United Nations? Is there even a non-profit organization and is there any hope that such a system could be rationally discussed, optimized, taking into account the considerations of the common citizen, of all relevant groups of society? I think the problem is that to set up a system of carbon accounting you actually first need a system of epistemic accounting - you need the epistemic commons once more to function and the epistemic commons have to function updated to the digital world." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/bHCg8bhtbqs?t=2056)

You have to pursue the asymmetric advantages and because these are both relatively new nations the asymmetric advantages meant integrating digital infrastructure into government, but also integrating digitally native people, staff, talent into government and opening yourself to public discourse as a method of sense-making. You lean into the strength of an open society rather than imitate the strengths of a closed society because if you try to beat China being a close society - well you know it's it's not going to really work out for you especially if China's 100 times larger." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/bHCg8bhtbqs?t=3123)

> "What we did on economics is we took the tiniest slice of human behavior - self-interest - and then we wrapped it with abstract mathematics in the late 1800s. Big chunks of our economic theory has been there ever since. This theory of the self-interested individual wrapped in mathematics is built from the sanctity of the person and personhood and it's kind of all set up to guarantee market equilibrium. It's also over the course of the last hundred+ years a theory that has largely been walled off from other disciplines while growing in influence and in stature and Academia, infecting public policy, business administration, infecting the other social sciences, and even in more recent years affecting the Natural Sciences. When its assumptions are challenged, or when the theory of the rational actor - the self-interested individual - doesn't hold up against other theories or other disciplines, or when the scientific method gets in the way, economists have this very convenient line "it's just a model", or they often quote George box - the statistician - "All models are wrong, some are useful". I would add one little piece to that: "All models are wrong, some are useful" - I agree - "Useful for whom?" - and that's the big question that we need to ask today." - [Jon David Erickson](https://youtu.be/EC11UQD9q3w?t=369)

> "Following the example of autoimmune diseases, the main cause of warfare is a misidentification, i.e. perceiving a fellow cell within humanity as the Other. Although the actors of war are political organizations (following Levy & Thompson’s definition of war), individuals are the ones who do the actual fighting to advance the interests of the leadership of a particular political organization. In the case of warfare, the interest of the leadership and the fighting individuals rarely correlate. Consequently, the political elite must convince the public that liquidating fellow cells within the collective body is the only option left to resolve an ongoing conflict. Here ideology plays the most crucial role. State ideology is disseminated to the people via various propaganda organs. The false framework of “us vs. them” is established by magnifying the differences between human beings (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political opinion, membership of a particular social group etc.) while willfully ignoring the fact that we are equally important and valuable cells within humanity. Divide et impera (“divide and conquer”) is an ancient Latin maxim that was widely used in every historical era. In the twentieth and twenty-first century we witnessed narratives based on binary opposites such as Aryan vs. Jew (World War II), communist vs. capitalist (Cold War) and terrorist vs. peace-loving citizen (War on Terror). Creating an image of the enemy (the Other) and instilling fear in the public are classic examples of the propaganda machine specifically designed to manufacture an ideology based on division." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "The healthy state of humanity is peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Although the increasing destructiveness of military technology reduced the incentives of major powers to fight large-scale wars, we still see significant amount of warfare in the world. These developments suggest that the general quality of consciousness of humanity is rather low. Identifying a fellow cell as an enemy because it lives in another organ (cf. nationality), looks like a red blood cell instead of a white one (cf. race), believes in the heart instead of the brain (cf. religion), and follows the kidney instead of the gall bladder (cf. political affiliation), is not the characteristic of an efficient, well-organized, low-entropy system. I suggest that the top-down approach toward peaceful coexistence does not work as the failure of the Kellogg-Briand pact (1928) demonstrated. The potentially more effective bottom-up design (eradicating ignorance one person at a time by identifying the Other as an equal unit within the collective body) may lead to a quantum leap in the consciousness of humanity that will result in – among others – the total absence of warfare based on the realization of our interconnectedness and essential oneness. The reason why the so-called Golden Rule of every major world religion stipulates to treat others the way we would like to be treated is because every individuated unit is part of the whole (i.e. humanity, and ultimately, the Self). Given that the Self (the Absolute that is commonly referred to as Tao in Taoism, Brahman in Hinduism, God in Christianity, Yahweh in Judaism and Allah in Islam) consists of everything and everybody (the four elements, the mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom and the human kingdom), harming the Other is literally harming the Self – myself. The only possible explanation behind damaging the Other is the lack of recognition that there is no Other: everything and everybody is part of the Self." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "Immense financial, natural and human resources are directed at warfare, even though one trivial realization on a mass scale would result in the total cessation of all hostilities. This realization is that every Other (the so-called “enemy”) is in actuality a fellow cell, because regardless of the superficial differences these very units comprise the living organism we call humanity. The healthy, peaceful, cooperative state of humanity needs to be every responsible human being’s concern." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

Cultural evolution is the continuation of biological evolution

democracy is like an economic market where you can only buy your products once every few years and many different aspects are clumped into representatives from only a few suppliers (2 in the US). If economic markets worked like that they wouldn't be creative or efficient

vertical markets are a disaggregation of democracy - enabling evolvability of governance solutions through fine-grained competition and trial & error

If a vertical market exists, an externality is like an unmet personal need in an economic market - a profit opportunity for any enterpreneur who wants to develop an element of governance that corrects that externality in a cooperative fashion

Governance and democracy need to be unbundled - their current forms (electing representatives every few years) were conceived centuries ago because we simply couldn't have done it better back then - we need to reinvent them in the digital era.


Global consciousness can be thought of just like ours: thousands of competing signals for our conscious attention (our global workspace) coming from all directions - most of which are filtered out - surfacing only the most pressing ones. We need to develop a hierarchical system that surfaces the most important signals and information.

> "Consequence capture - so basically what governance does is reflect back onto the individuals of the collective the consequences of their actions on the collective as a whole.

If its good enough for nature, it is good enough for us. We are part of nature.

Our goal should be to come up with the best and most important education for every human and then figure out how to diffuse the gradient between the least and best educated people. Nature is intolerant of gradients (temperature, pressure, electrical charge) and neither should our culture when it comes to education.

> "Now humanity is going through the biggest event since the time that bacteria formed the nucleated cell because we're now trying to form the body of humanity around the globe. Seeing that other species matured out of a youthful competitive phase into a mature cooperative phase means everything to us now. The Darwinian story only goes to the adolescent part where there's hostile competition. You take all you can get. You fight your enemy. You try to out-do him or try to bump him off and that's what makes you survive. But that's not what sustainability is all about. Sustainability happens when species learn to feed each other instead of fight each other. You get mature ecosystems such as rainforests and prairies where you have far more cooperation than you have hostile competition. You can still have friendly competition, but that's very different. So I see humanity doing exactly this right now." - [After Darwin, by Elisabet Sahtouris](https://ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/AfterDarwin.html#:~:text=Now%20humanity%20is,this%20right%20now.)

We could call the heart-lung system the “northern industrial organs”. You give them ownership of the bones in which you mine the raw material blood cells that arise in the marrow. Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today.

And we really do create our realities out of our beliefs. If we don't believe in a positive world in which all humans are liberated to express their creativity, we cannot build it.

Politics should be replaced by simply putting the right person at the right spot - incentivising expertise and accountability - alining incentives

Mindlink

Everything is connected - what if we mapped it all out?

What if we could collectively agree on offchain "CBDC" protocols and could collectively vote what should happen to them?

We can crowdsource and agree upon what the most fundamental concept of our civilisation should be, and why, and enforce it within there
Cooperation and education and the scientific method

Just like the CCP crafts policy papers which are then handed down to executive branches, we should crowdsource our civilisational policies and reward companies that implement them with higher ranking

We can crowdsource how the world should work and walk backwards from that until it becomes applicable to us currently

The meaning economy - how power, attention and incentives work in the global brain

Civilizational KPIs

Planning ahead for a debt jubilee

Anything that needs improvement in this new information economy will be collectively incentivised through reputation and pagerank

We should orient our lives towards building reputation that can be taken away from us by collective consensus - aligning our incentives.


PageRank 2.0

We can design the incentive system for participating in constructing the worldview that should be taught to everyone

Not living your best self is hurting the whole

We can sort the expertise of any vertical and then use the best

We need to crowdsource a new manager (as from john’s work) for the next step of our civilisation

Imagine the multidimentional oscars where any overlapping subset of people can vote differently - and all that in public. What different cohorts think, and what the cohort with the highest predictive capacity and competence and achievement ranks highest.


What if it becomes a competitive advantage for companies to allow their employees to export and prove their competence from their work there? Opening the gates for those that want to work in public and transparently


This is the real neuralink - the real way we link our minds

We should crowdsource the best possible guide to being a human

Reinventing governance

Cooperation is the ultimate intentionally evolutional goal

Write about wealth distribution and accumulation and how we should think about it

We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point
^^ this should be in the roadmap as a strategy

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

!!!! The great reset: !!!!
We should incentivise participating transparently in public and make that the only way of climbing the social ladder - a complete flattening of the power distribution - this is the great reset

The current elites would have to start earning reputation from the ground up on the new rules

Hierarchy is a core tenet in computer science

Headjack offers a few distinct data availability setups - fully decentralized or proxy-mediated

the god of the 21st century has to be cooperation, backed by the scientific method and evolutionary theory


we use symbols and categories in our minds and there's a single representation for any concept/entity/event - we should do the same for the global brain

hyperindividualism will be our doom

we need a holistic view of the inerconnectedness of our civilization

The blank slate participatory redesign of our civilization

at the core of intelligence is the capacity for relevance realization - according to john vervaeke
relevance realization is self-organizing

the better we causally map reality, the better we'd navigate and realize what is relevant

Debasing the substrate upon which we depend

Our technical capability is growing exponentially while our capacity to make sense of the exponentially increasing complexity of the world is diminishing - this runs off a cliff
our information ecology is increasingly more broken

We need to let ideas have sex as Matt Ridley put it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLHh9E5ilZ4

imagine being able to subscribe to better metaphors for concepts you care about - metaphors that better get those ideas across to others. "Let me know when a more effective way of communicating this idea comes up"

we should be thinking in terms of sensory & motor systems - OODA loop

rewarding whistleblowing

the absence of reciprocity shouldn't pay - free riding should be abolished

In biology, within an organism, different organs or cells don't try to hide information from others - there is absolute transparency - even if signals don't traverse from end to end (most of the times it doesn't make sense)

A parallel reputational sensemaking network

Participatory social engineering

we could give points for "filling your profile" - values, top 10s, etc.

Eventually, the network will become more powerful than both god and state.

augmenting markets, economics & finance with reputation and status

booting up the reputation/accountability/status market

Identity is something stable others can point to

extending capitalism to social capital

We are all complicit in ignorance

Inversion of control

Coherence funnel == concept/entity/event deduplication

We need to rethink most foundations of our civilization

concern: permanent record

Gamifying information processing

We can define the fitness landscape

Ignorance is an externality

We can incentivize specific affiliation and accreditation - nudging human resources


Mention the carbon pulse

Insight and progress happen at the edge of chaos - where we operate with concrete structure and ideas but inject randomness and allow for new kinds of pattern matching and mix and matching

All this is about the god paragraph

This is the social protocol
Cooperation, transparency, immutability
God

This is what self actualization is

This is the god that defeats moloch

To be in service of/to others

There >>>IS<<< an objective reality about any of our problems and we need to strive to get closer to it in our models of understanding

John Vervake’s legacy will be the contribution of relevance realization as a mental frame

We can gamify alignment

We can literally find ourselves in the situation of the movie dont look up

We can have a means to accurately assess the quality of the leaders we choose

Blockchain is the alignment technology that supersedes the old paradigm of nation states and markets with their current flaws 

“Use it or lose it” - we haven't even had a global brain to begin with (the closest we have is markets but they're unconscious) - imagine what we could achieve as a civilization

This idea is worth worshiping tm

Virtue’s most literal manifestation is cooperation

The alignment problem is 99% about human alignment

This project is how we build god and become him

The network is more powerful than the state

The full historical record of our work on the tree-like branching relevance realization requires immutable addressibility and permissionless access by anyone - at scale (no limits)

We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?

To be a philosopher is partially to work on relevance realization, just like fundamental physics, or biology

This architecture enables the construction of the global consciousness - the global spotlight of most deserving attention - the global workspace theory - the global model of awareness

Taming human nature collectively

Write about the evolutionary adaptability of religions
“Turn the other cheek” - this is an attempt to tame human nature, to reduce conflict and to be moral to others.

Ego death is when you look at the world without the distortion of your own ego and seeing all the love - that is when you’re close to god - the desire to cooperate with everyone

Ego death is the transcendence above our nature - the leap towards the unification and alignment of the smartest and most conscious creature on earth

What if we could harness the will to power in the attempt of becoming god by 
"harnessing the will to power"

What if we could incentivize ambition the right way?
Aligning ambition within humanity

The purpose of life is relevance realization
The purpose of art is to point the way

What if we could choose cooperation as our god? And implemented incentives around identity such that the better and more you cooperate with others and contribute to society, the higher your status gets - closer to becoming god himsef?

What if god is the striving towards relevance realization in evolutionary terms?

What if the answer is relevance realization?

Give a list about what our civilization ought to do next - even immediately - to the best of your ability to forecast

We can vote our own version of the WEF - the one where we decide what to value

Labelers… adjudication

We need to strive for the most optimal relevance realization
Picture the god machine and how the root has the most impact in where the whip goes

Division of labor for the moderation and proper tagging with an incentive reputation for the exchange of time

We need to give the best possible education to everyone in the world - especially the disadvantaged

We need to change how we give status

We can make contributing a status thing

We can have a vote on how to rank votes for any type of other voting - effectively how do we give different kinds of status and how much do we value it

We can vote on the type of cbdc we would want

This is the booting of a network state where status is computable over track record and accountability and competence

The first and forever biggest network state that engulfs the rest will be the meta global governance layer based on transparency, accountability and competence

This is the idea market

The concern with global government is that it could cement the status quo of broken incentives and misalignment

42 is relevance realization

Why do threadboys exist?

What comes after the state?

For some people the state is their god - how would the global government that younwould vote for be architected? This is the question we could collectively answer and reach alignment of humanity

The people dont want the current power structures to be cemented and because of the fear of the slippery slope to tyranny we reject globalisation

AGI is recursive relevance realization that has fully aligned everyone
The AGI moment is when we start cooperating

We need a market for transparency and accountability. On the record

















how do we optimize society?
how do we make sure capital and human labor is allocated better?

Feed the same thing multiple times for greater weight - AI alignment

A voluntary information modulation network

A prerequisite for all of us to be on the same page and achieve coherence is to deduplicate all pages - i.e. concepts, entities, and events.
We need to answer every question just once and in the best possible way - so that we can easily point to it anytime it comes up. Coherence.

What if we could tag the response of someone as open-minded and willing to change their mind when confronted with facts - aka genuinely seeking truth? We need to reward good faith communication

The evolutionary octagon
An opt-in panopticon

we need to augment capitalism with values and accountability

The fairness protocol as god
The god protocol is about fairness and consent

We are incapable of collectively paying attention to what matters - who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience?

Currently, Wikipedia contributors get no status for their work beyond within their in-group - no wonder that so many people were skeptical it would ever work in the beginning. But what if they could earn computable and provable status that could be exported outside?

scaling labeling through progressive hierarchical escalation & fixing incentives

status for page rank could have decay


What if having worked for a company that got penalized also penalized your reputation - tainting?

Starting with banning pizzerias to burn coal is the most retarded thing we could be doing compared to a carbon tax or fixing our values and status as a society.

We need to direct our efforts towards the real economy - we could anonymously vote for what we want

So many people have critiqued utilitarianism but when I go to the criticism section of Wikipedia’s page for it ai see a tiny amount - not interwoven with identity and queryable.

Imagine being able to run any kind of poll for the people in the shared group - with different privacy settings - different types of voting for within groups and even worldwide polls

what if we could penalize someone for re-uploading a clip instead of linking to the part of the original without losing the context?

Recursive relevance realization
For everything

It is fundamentally an education crisis

Why don’t we derive everything from “most people are good?”

We are constantly amplifying the wrong things - how can we point to the important stuff?

The better we map out the economy, the better we’d be able to run provable simulations - digital twins of the economy

What if you got points for passing different tests for competence and training

What if we could give an account boost for anyone with a job? And so people who choose not to work currently might decide to work a bit for more status - boosting their overall number/score?
What if we gave more status to billionaires if they donated 10% (or 20?) of their wealth?
TODO: how could this backfire? they could essentially buy attentional influence with their money and make more money... Perhaps reputation should decay?
Capitalism leads to wealth concentration, (inflationary fiat money does too) but is the best form of aligning incentives and promoting risk-taking and hard work.
We can augment it (& markets) by redefining status and incentivizing generosity.
Donations shouldn't be compelled and shouldn't simply go to the ever-hungry and unaccountable/inefficient/corrupt Uncle Sam in the form of a tax ("tax the rich!!! pay your fair share!!!") - anyone should be free to direct their donation however they choose.

we can even give more weight to recent successful predictions and discount the earliest ones - when someone was still learning to think probabilistically and knew little about the world

Few people could predict uber and airbnb - most were extremely sceptical. The same will be true for the sharing economy

What if we could reward the switching of beliefs in such a way as to incentivize early adopters of better ideas?

What if we could allow the greatest minds, scientists & game theorists to compete and engineer the best models for ranking humans based on their public contributions? Rewarding competency, predictive power, and adaptability (changing their minds when they're initially wrong). This can be the greatest game of all time - scoring high in the ever-evolving global ranking - where even anonymous accounts can participate. Enders game?

We can crowdsource the best legend of "how to participate and what you need to know in order to be good - statistical/bayesian thinking, etc." by checking what the highest-ranking members have suggested - like the "subreddit rules" that moderators define.

The Integrated Evolutionary Synthesis will reveal why all these processes are equivalent and rely on the same problem-solving algorithm, known as variation-and-selection, which is a form of trial-and-error learning." - [Turn Your Life into a Game With the Teleological Stance and Learn to Live Optimally](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/turn-your-life-into-a-game-with-the#:~:text=How%20does%20a,error%20learning.)

> "The scientific landscape has long been dominated by reductionism, a methodological approach that seeks to understand complex phenomena by breaking them down into simpler component parts. While this perspective has undeniably fostered significant advances in our understanding of the natural world, it has also contributed to a fragmented and disconnected view of reality that implies that life is accidental and meaningless. In recent decades, the nihilism of postmodernism has added another layer of complexity and confusion to the scientific discourse, casting doubt on the very foundations of knowledge and truth. As we grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, a new scientific and philosophical paradigm is urgently needed—one that transcends the limitations of both reductionism and postmodernism, while retaining their contributions to our understanding of the world." - [Poetic Meta-Naturalism: A New Philosophy of Reality for the Metamodern Age](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/poetic-meta-naturalism-a-new-philosophy#:~:text=The%20scientific%20landscape,of%20the%20world.)

tallying strategy - how to count the votes

Self assembly! There isnt the number 5 in our genome about the number of fingers

We can use reputation and incentives to solve collective action problems - the system is flexible enough to design any type of incentive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_theory

observer... depends who he is - about any score/prism

Problem: much harder to have 1 person 1 phone number with many IDMs

We get more of what we reward

Earning status in public in the status machine

Define arbitrary status models - different pagerank algorithms for identities, concepts & events!
the results of one page ranking model can be fed into another - layering/wiring complex models
Google's page rank algorithm simply counts the number of inbound links to a page. It's surely evolved to include other heuristics and some notion of reputation, but pales in comparison to the ranking flexibility and power of an open-ended system built around identity and reputation.

We organize our view with tags and lists and let others see our prism - this way the prisms will converge

Relevance filters

what if we could vote on a captain of the attention ship? someone who aims to illuminate the biggest problems - speaking truth to power

what if the brightest minds in game theory, mathematics and statistics could tune society in public?

We put so much effort in trying to optimise attention with the goal of extracting statistical correlations and patterns and yet we do such a bad job at directing the attention of society
The great misallocation of attention

Picture humanity in the most realistic way possible

A new relationship with information

How do we make scientists rich and famous?

This idea will also force the reimplementation of something like patreon

Imagine all the youth competing to surface the most truth to the world in the global transparency game

Imagine if instead of having to read a book like “the real antony fauci” all you had to do was look at the computed score of anthony fauci based on criteria you trust

A network for transparency

With canonical deduplicated entries for concepts and events, reality will be harder to ignore

ranking the top concerns of humanity is like becoming aware of our discomfort - a problem well stated is half solved

a permissionless and open-ended event ecosystem around identity is a prerequisite for the global brain

human progress happens when we increase our ability to ask questions

imagine talking with the aggregate sentiment and knowledge of the world with the help of an LLM and exploring humanity in real time through any lens you wish - not with some pre-trained model without a clue how the sausage was made

getting structured data formats wrong isn't fatal - we can always translate old data to newer and more expressive formats. Evolvability.

social learning in regards to the complexity of ontologies and working with knowledge graphs and structured data - since it's all one big social network we'd see how others are using the tools and creating structured data - effectively teaching us how to better express ourselves

The metaverse is the augmentation of the physical with the digital

how to counteract discounting

"synthesis" as project name

better social technologies lower social coordination costs and reduce friction

what if you could define a notification filter for messages/connection requests/etc - anyone with above 10k followers for example

multi-pagerank
poly/multi

social media posts are ephemeral - they're irrelevant beyond the first couple of days (get burried with time) - they're promoted by the recommendation algorithms only for a a small amount of time as there's a constant stream of new events

hit pieces use points selectively (and its hard to gague them of truthfullness) whereas a model calculating a reputation score would take everything into account

radical interconnectedness - glancing at a blog post and being able to see which sections were quoted elsewhere, and being able to filter the "elsewhere" any way you want

the next step of encephalization is truly networking our minds - deduplicated identities, concepts & events

we need to upgrade our capacity to learn

A truth market for ideas

Relevance realization: given the near-infinite complexity of the world, how do we intelligibly ignore irrelevant information and zero in on that which is relevant to us?

think of this as collectively writing the guide to/book of life

We need to shift from what are we against to what are we for

It will simply be better and people would shift to it as word goes around

what if we submitted algorithms along a few lines that express more complex things? the collective notebook with interactive code trying to prove stuff?

we could all collectively have a conversation through the distributed aggregate computing of all individuals



If there are no consequences for wall street playing the “short and distort” game with Tesla for a decade (including the hardest of times for them) - then we should be able to de-amplify topics and entities too. Todo: this point needs more thought

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

what if you want to be able to message someone (they're a contact) but you don't want to follow them on instagram because you're simply not interested in reels and them ending up in your feed and you also don't have a DM channel open with them? its engineered for engagement

we could even split our own vote like 30% from me and the rest 70% split between my delegates for this cause

We need an additional informational signal that is as robust as prices driven by markets and currently media is a failure

write about mycelium

TODO: think about labeling of naughty material and the streisand effect

what if the tags for a creator are automatically updated based on the tags for their individual posts and also ranked by occurance with a histogram?

“The religion that is not a religion” - stolen from John
Wisdom and meaning famine

evolution is a kind of learning - we need to foster gradual evolvability in every direction

what if we could short topics? like putting our thumbs on the scales - "show less culture war stuff and surface more important issues"

minimizing ignorance - we need to minimize the error in our models of reality

"complex adaptive systems (CAS) all the way down"

what if we could have citation graphs and ranking for anyone on any topic - not just within the scientific realm?

Imagine having your personal jamie to pull things up

fractal debate map

Money on money return

situational awareness - what's the relevant context - being able to view the same thing from different lenses

being wrong should have a cost

We can have competing opt-in committees of experts for health advice

meaning in life comes from connectedness, and especially being connected to something bigger than ourselves

We can crowdsource what is most important and even rank and sort the steps to get to there!!!

complete freedom to experiment in network protocols and self-assembly / self-organization

What if we could develop an opt-in social credit score that we individually determine how it gets calculated? A subjective score

a new choice-making architecture

No Recursively asking “how do we get there? What are the next steps?”

“The recursive subreddit” as a buillding block - a concept

Use a picture of a cockpit with thousands of buttons when talking about social media configurability and the config matrix

A new era of social computing
“Social computing”

The ultimate currency is time and thus also attention

Error correction scaled

We can crowdsource “a guide to life”

We can have campaigns in which we advocate for our values against those of others - in groups, and showing the progress publicly, and how the vote evolves throughout time

Its all just one big high dimensional wikipedia - a multipedia

We can crowdsource what to teach our children - skills, values, technologies
And not just children - even adults. We can collectively guide our attention to what is most meaningful

A philosophical & scientific MMORPG

Meaning in the 21st century - become competent in something, be credible and have the ability to influence stuff - and increase the weight of your vote - a weight thats calculated by consensus

Meaning in the 21st century: aiming for a higher impact if your opinions - earning that weight and have the ability for it to decrease at any point if you do wrong things.
“The reward function” as a chapter

TODO: use high dimensional instead of multi? or not.

Adding dimensionality to thoughts - the ability to filter opinion any way you want

The ability to vote on how votes should be counted in compound model representations

with liquid democracy each person could be a high dimensional representation of their own views

what if we sankey-diagramed every aspect and product of society - from carbon footprint to what transitive connections there are to low-ranking and sociopathic companies and even monetary influence

Negative reputation: carbon footprint, money influence, previous scandals

Bringing liquidity to ideas
A market for any idea

We are unconscious as a species

Whistleblower friendly ecosystem

the most radical experiment in self-organization and emergent order to date

this can replace even phone numbers

instead of upvote/downvote - 5 star ratings on 2 measures: quality and importance

Music… flow… your attention

game b should parasitize game A
game b should be meta-stable

> "With the detonation of the first atomic bomb, a new age of humanity began. At that moment, a rapidly accelerating technological power finally reached the threshold where we might be able to destroy ourselves — the first point where the threat to humanity from within exceeded the threats from the natural world.

> "As Nassim Taleb puts it in his book Antifragile, anything done with the explicit intent to improve one’s status likely won’t improve one’s status.

> "Why do people want to improve their reputation? Well, our main evolutionary goals in life are survival and reproduction. Having a good reputation is what makes those goals possible — it’s what makes people want to work with you, take care of you, and partner with you.
>
> But how do status and reputation work? Think about it like this: imagine we all have a number floating above our heads — that's our status score. We can't see it, but we have a sense for where we rank — dating apps even go so far as to quantify it. Over time we learn to perceive both our own score and that of others.
>
> We’re so attune to our status score that we’re laser focused on increasing it even at the expense of seeing objective reality, or truth. As Don Hoffman writes in “The Case Against Reality” “An organism that sees reality as it truly is is never more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality and is just attuned to fitness payoffs” Or as Don says elsewhere: “Optimizing for truth can make you extinct.”
>
> It’s not that we’ll see objective reality (or truth) and consciously ignore it—our brains won’t even filter for it in the first place. In other words, the first thing we see isn’t whether something is true or not, and then decide whether it’s good for us. We do the opposite: We first filter for what’s good for us, and then filter for truth—this explains why we feel emotions first, and then rationalize them after.
>
> To be sure, this doesn’t mean objective reality doesn’t exist. It means we often don’t perceive reality accurately because it’s not aligned with our interest. We think people are rational, but if anything, recent scientific discoveries tell us most of human rationality is not used to make decisions, but rather to come up with arguments to rationalize decisions the subconscious brain has already made." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=Why%20do%20people,has%20already%20made.)

> "The best deceiver is the person who doesn’t even know they’re deceiving. If you truly believe your lie, you won’t betray it. So not only are there selection pressures to deceive others, but also to deceive yourself. The more you deceive yourself, the better you can deceive—or convince—others of the same narrative. The best salespeople are the most fervent believers, those with no traces of doubt." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=the%20best%20deceiver,traces%20of%20doubt.)

> "What does the prioritization of the status score over objective reality imply? That people who want social status will believe and say whatever is convenient, no matter how crazy. Indeed, it’s more predictive to think of “belief” not as something someone thinks of as true, but as something someone thinks will improve their reputation. Want more evidence people don’t prioritize objective truth? You may have noticed that after centuries of the scientific method, people still believe in things like Astrology.
>
> And that’s exactly why the precise content of any ideological point doesn't matter. Brains don’t care about ideology. They didn’t evolve to care about abstract concepts. Indeed: Many people are hypocrites with regard to their overt ideological claims if they can get away with it. Rich elites talk about Global Warming while living in lavish mansions and flying private. Rich parents talk about the importance of public schools while they put their kids in fancy private schools. Cognitive dissonance? No; those cognitive systems are not connected to begin with." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=What%20does%20the,to%20begin%20with.)

> "This is why people aren’t open to changing their minds — because there's no reason they should be. Ideas aren’t about logic, they’re about loyalty. Ideas are Schelling points for tribes. If saying certain things means you’ll make more friends, well, you’re probably going to say those things. That’s the purpose of ideas — to make better friends.
>
> This is also why arguments are often useless, and only cause people to dig into their pre-existing positions. All this stuff about steel-manning other arguments to find truth—it may catalyze scientific progress, but in most social circles, it’s also a surefire way to lose friends and alienate people. (Which is why people who do so are heroes, and why communities who encourage it are foundational for progress).
>
> Indeed: Understanding how the outgroup thinks is frowned upon. You’re not supposed to try to understand what’s going on. You’re supposed to not get it and loudly condemn it. We think of this blind allegiance as harmful behavior, but it actually signals and induces loyalty to one’s in-group." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20people,to%20one%E2%80%99s%20in%2Dgroup.)

> "So then why do we care so much about politics? What's the point of ideology? Ideology is the water you swim in. It’s a structured database of excuses, used to signal your allegiance or defection to the existing ruling coalition. This is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. Different ideas suit different people at different times. Ideas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas. Which is why the culture war is so existential — because the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit. They don’t really care where they get it; they only care that it’s good.
>
> So what determines what people say? It seems clear that the default mode of thinking for humans is groupthink, and the content of that groupthink is computed with a complex algorithm taking into account one's peer group, the loyalties one owes and to whom, who has more status and what talking points fit better with the religion that one has been dutifully drilled into since kindergarten." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=So%20then%20why,into%20since%20kindergarten.)

> "There are various ways of interpreting Current Things.
>
> A charitable view is that it’s the wisdom of crowds surfacing the most important problems as well as the best ways of solving those problems. 
>
> A less charitable view is that Current Things are “continuous overlapping sequence of emergencies, awakenings and panics, driven by the same interlocking power centers, demanding ever tighter censorship of speech and thought.”
>
> An even less charitable view is that Current Things, paraphrasing Balaji, are the social equivalents of pump and dumps: They are pump and dumps for clicks for the journalists, votes for the politicians, and dollars for the activists. After all, the business model of the press & social media might as well be to cause the reader as much outrage as possible, every day, to cause fear and panic and drive them to come back tomorrow.
>
> These are all interesting observations — that Current Things involve everyone converging onto the same beliefs and that there are profit motives for increasingly surfacing New Current Things — but they undersell the truthiness of The Current Thing.
>
> Current Things always have elements of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t capture the world’s imagination. If they didn’t contain at least some kernels of truth, they wouldn't resonate. 
>
> That said, there is also often something “off” about The Current Thing as well. If it were so obviously, incontrovertibly accurate, it wouldn’t go viral, since everyone would be convinced already. There’s no need for evangelism when everyone is already converted. What goes viral is often what creates controversy between groups, where people retweet & quote tweet as a way to claim what side they’re on. If they don’t speak up, their tribal loyalty is questioned. Hence the phrase “silence is violence”.
>
> Additionally, for a moral incident to go viral — for it to be The Current Thing — it has to be super clear-cut. And real-life events usually aren’t that clear-cut.

More specifically regarding blindness, people become unwilling to critically analyze the Current Thing if it goes against the belief, precisely because that analysis is a threat to the coherence of the group. When this happens at the group level, this becomes The Madness of Crowds, as opposed to The Wisdom of Crowds, which we usually get when everyone is thinking as a rational individual, not when they are delegating their opinions to the zeitgeist." - [The Current Thing, Part 1 - How and why it works, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-1#:~:text=Jonathan%20Haidt%2C%20in,to%20the%20zeitgeist.)

People act differently in front of the camera—they perform for their tribe, especially when people’s tribal loyalty is in question, as it always is in a society where our tribal bonds are formed over beliefs instead of genetics or geography. And the internet offers the widest camera angle possible—everyone is in the frame 24/7, always at risk of being called out.

> "Here’s the kicker: the crazier a bonding ideology is—the further away it is from objective reality—the more powerful it is in forming tribes. Why? The crazier the idea, or the crazier the way a person defends their idea, the more it proves their loyalty to the group by shutting off their other available options. Your perceived loyalty increases when you make yourself unsuitable for other tribes because it proves you won’t defect and join them. Until you do that, all tribal attachments are fleeting and contingent.
>
> Consider the phrase, “Abolish the police”, a Current Thing in 2020. Even the people who claimed “Abolish the police” concede that’s not what they truly meant. They meant redirecting police funds to social services and reforming police accountability. But the phrase “Abolish the police” achieves the goal of improving their reputation within their tribe because, by abandoning reasonableness, they are burning the boats to the enemy tribe, demonstrating their in-group loyalty. 
>
> This is also why Abolish the Police was such a textbook Current Thing. “Increased social services for poor people” would have never taken off, nor would “Reform police unions”. People have been trying to get attention to those topics for decades. Only something crazy, but with a kernel of truth, could get such wide attention.

> "The core function of science is not peer review, publishing in a prestigious journal, or having an academic affiliation. It’s independent replication — the repetition of an experiment such that the variance of that experiment can be better estimated.

> To say that true scientific inquiry is the same as a general appeal to authority is categorically incorrect. The latter may have the form of science, in the sense that it could be laid out like a logically sound argument, but it doesn't have the substance of science, which is based on independent replication. 
>
> And yet, we can’t replicate experiments at the drop of a hat, so we do rely on prestige as a proxy. Because it’s so hard for people to disprove claims, or for us to keep track of who’s been right and who’s been wrong over time, they’re more likely to believe  elite media and universities when they say something is true, no matter how often they’re wrong. 
>
> Despite how wrong epidemiologists are, despite how wrong nutrition science was for decades—food pyramid anyone?—despite the replication crisis which challenges much of psychology—nothing really changes. When elite media and universities say something is true, people will believe it. Furthermore, often people won’t believe a claim until it gets blessed by the experts.

> "The [Iron Law of Oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy) states that all organizations, including those committed to democratic ideals and practices, will inevitably succumb to rule by an elite few (an oligarchy). The theory states that true democracy can't happen mechanically, because a large number of people cannot coordinate or organize. Only small groups can organize. So whenever you have “democracy” or a large number of people who are supposed to coordinate, they simply can’t. So instead a small number of people who can coordinate seize all the power." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=the%20Iron%20Law%20of%20Oligarchy%20states,can%20coordinate%20seize%20all%20the%20power.)

> "The cycle from democracy to oligarchy often looks like this:
>
> First, a large democratic group is formed. Everyone tries to have a say. This creates conflict, and all discussions go on for a long time as they try to resolve the conflict. Most people leave because the decision-making process is taking too long.
>
> Eventually, fewer people remain and some of them present their plans. The crowd picks the plans that make the most sense and the planners get designated as leadership.
>
> The planners slowly turn into the elite and start to reinforce their power. These elites also begin to control access to information and become progressively less and less accountable to the rank and file members.
>
> Over time, the oligarchy develops values that are at odds with its regular members. Elites become higher status, and feel that they must have some way of [differentiating themselves from the democratic masses](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/beliefs-are-fashions). They slowly begin to push for things that are [good for elites but not necessarily good for the rest of the group](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-hypocrisy-of-elites).
>
> Once it is in place, democratic members lack the means to displace the oligarchy. It would require coordination that democracies simply don’t have. Additionally, the oligarchy won out as the most effective structure due to its strategic capabilities. For this reason, in any formally democratic organization, power will always slowly disperse away from members and into the hands of an elite." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=The%20cycle%20from,of%20an%20elite.)

This movement from the simple to the complex is built into the web and weave of the universe, and it's called the tendency toward complexity.

Bret's point is that there is a positive feedback loop between lobbying and making more money due to lobbying which affords more lobbying - aka regulatory capture. We need to engineer a negative feedback force that is adequate enough to constrain such unstable and self-terminating feedback loops.
This unconstrained feedback loop is perhaps the biggest contributor to wealth and power concentration.
Furthermore, people and corporations that do the right thing often disadvantage themselves (often in the form of having less money) which leaves them with less power which leads to further disadvantage - Bret calls that the "Personal Responsibility Vortex".
This personal responsibility should be directed towards collective action aimed at restructuring the incentives that surround the market and chanring the malignant behavior.
All costs and negative externalities (polution & environmental damage, even debt for future generations) need to be accounted for.
All manufactured demand needs to be called out.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for adaptive evolution are: 1) reproduction, 2) variation, 3) heritibility, 4) differential success.
What if we could engineer an informational environment where truth and error correction is the dominant strategy through the right incentives and mechanisms for collective action?
Reputation, structured data that anyone can analyze, and deduplicating concepts, entities & events are a big part of that.
We can engineer our fitness landscape.

the inability for anyone to programatically process public data flexibly and reliably in any way imaginable limits our capacity for collective self-introspection and error correction. The host-centric model must go.

We need to develop the mechanisms to continually bring our theory of the collective mind closer to reality and that involves error correction, reputation, transparency, and immutable history.

In retrospect we will wonder how we could be contempt with what social media was in the first few decades of this century

Light is the best disinfectant

Amplification choice and transparency

Unique notification signatures (sounds, vibrations, icons, colors) help us disambiguate between sources and we can have less need to instantly check where the notification came from
Ambiguity sets off a mental process of us wandering “What was that?” - hiding the punchline, stimulating arousal, and leading to distraction

inconsequential notifications ("someone liked your photo") don't need to be delivered immediately - they can be batched - instead of the current way


Credits for queries - monetization for infra companies

People that have to use social media for work but dont want to get distracted can make different presets for the UI with different restrictions

We must empower those with predictive power



your public process of doing something for others gives you credibility how well you're doing and that gives weight to your vote on something.

post physique reddit - how about post food? how about we crowdsource marketing for what we truly love and drown out advertising from broadcast media?

memes encode semantic structure - the one with Anakin and ", right?" as a template always has the same structure. We are pattern matching slots of ideas and expressions visually - how further could we push the encoding of information for more efficient communication?

we are at the absolute other end of the spectrum of where we should be - having just 2 main political views and media being aligned with them. We need to shard our attention into a million pieces

the next iteration of the mechanism and experiment that is America will be global and digital

heck, why don't we vote on our own top movies list like the oscars


Prestige should be based on predictive ability - track record and skin in the game












what if we had views with different levels of granularity and detail for the whole picture? one set of humans are labelers - a task that is easily checkable and quite unambiguous, but the actual view of the world was produced by combining different labelers with different weights based on their reputation? Neural nets have many layers - feature recognition, etc.

# Exploring the Matrix

Toggling layers of the graph or whatever - monetary layer - how money and influence flow

we should be able to look up if person X has ever made a statement about X, and what they said - for example how do you currently query all the podcasts of Naval if he has ever said anything about Edward Snowden? How do you query that? You simply can't.

Artificial global intelligence is agi alignment

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

THIS IS AI ALIGNMENT - this is the alignment problem.
1. we must all have access to the data as easily and effortlessly as possible
2. we must use the crowdsourced competency and non-cancellation score when giving different weights of opinions.

Current AI is compression. Compression of sentiment

the way to alignment is towards increased transparency and accountability between us - we must create a cooperation environment to "train" (aka compress) the AI on

who watches the watchmen - who watches those that set the weights when training the models? what if the complete training could be separated into chunks as snapshots and we could occasionally pay extra to re-run the same part of the algorithm and compare results between expected and produced



imagine a media app and a set of algorithms and configuration options presented as a spreadsheet where for every cell someone is responsible, and the election for that cell is public and contains a debate map where we can filter the inputs of people based on the rules we determine are appropriate for us

== weights and parameters in algorithms
== crowdsourced algorithm weights & parameters & content modulation



we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

what if reputation had a computable value which you couldn't trade, but simply compute? No way to buy your way in - the only way being through a long enough track record?

Concern: no way to add friction when spreading information with sharing - how do you enforce that a link cannot be shared unless you’ve actually visited it? How do we combat the sharing of information based solely on the titles? Perhaps the signalling and labeling can come into play - ppl can show that a given app is not playing according to the good rules
Same about limiting the number of shares for a piece of content - perhaps up to 2 or 3 hops/levels
The further down a reshare chain (a reshare of a reshare of a reshare) - the more the distortion (razvalen gramofon)
If you want to share further beyond some limit you’d have to explicitly copy/paste it - this removes toxicity beyond a certain level

There should be no “magic/secret sauce” when it comes to recommendation algorithms. And we need to put the weights in the control of the users

We should think more carefully about the weights we give when ranking interactions
example: twitter's algorithm favors replies and gives a boost
what about CAD’s theorem of topic culture. A smart is less likely to receive a reply than a stupid post because it leaves less to be said, but a really full and comprehensive post will bring the conversation to a halt. 

Weights - should the reactions of someone who spends 8 hours a day online have the same weight as someone who reacts once a week or month? What if someone is producing 100 or 1000 times more content than the average account or more than the 99th percentile - should their ability to influence the ranking be the same as everybody else? Perhaps once you go beyond the activity of the 99th percentile you should start getting less and less impact for your actions for a rolling window
Compulsive social media users can (and do!) influence the algorithms for the rest of us
Something like the gini coefficient - capping and/or modulating the influence someone can have on the rest of us
Most people’s experience is asymmetrically influenced by “the compulsive few”
“The few, the proud, the compulsive”
Socially isolated people lean heavily on social media
Viral outbursts of anxiety


These are the types of questions and design decisions we’re simply not having and participating in because we’re outsiders for the social media platforms


What if there was a way to signal your preferred solution every time you comment on a problem? And what if we boosted responses that offer solutions/improvements? Inspired by solutions journalism

what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?

what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature

What if anyone could analyze the history of reactions of a post and see if there was an initial coordinated boost by some clique of connected accounts from a troll farm? Currrntly such analysis can be done only by insider data analysts

Identity can be computable





what if we could signal "back me up" for specific posts - leveraging our audience for select issues?

Feedback loop - you see what tags your audience expects and they see your content by tags if you’ve tagged it (or they could use AI to classify but that could be ambiguous)

We can show things in progress - suck as quitting smoking or participating in some challenge - justin.tv but with structured data

What if IDMs had to burn the native token when creating new accounts in a way similar to 1559? And what if this 1559 was not shared but per-idm? So that each IDM is throttled economically according to their own speed of growth?

> "Establishing a strong (i.e., hard to fake) process for uniquely identifying a person, for establishing that they are who they say they are through time and for distinguishing them from all other people, has become a foundational technology for our social/institutional relationships. The more complex your society and the farther away its central institutions are from real relationships, the more important identity becomes." - [The Meta-Crises and Digital Identity, by Jordan Hall](https://deepcode.substack.com/p/the-meta-crises-and-digital-identity#:~:text=Establishing%20a%20strong,important%20identity%20becomes.)

> "The major tech companies have long struggled to “capture” you by means of the efficiencies and services that can be brought to bear with a single digital identity. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook — all have recognized the power of being able to use a “single sign in” identity to give access to myriad services and then to load that identity with as much ‘value’ as possible so that you will continue to attach your attention and money to it. Notice how in this dynamic the relationship between self and identity has been reversed? That your self is increasingly subordinated and addicted to the ‘value’ attached to your identity? This is more than mere happenstance.
>
> For a long time, the tech kingdoms have been squabbling among themselves and for relatively minor aspects of identity. But as software has continued to eat the world, the power associated with digital identity has continued to escalate. Its one thing to control access to your email account or your Xbox. It’s another thing to control access to your money or your ability to vote." - [The Meta-Crises and Digital Identity, by Jordan Hall](https://deepcode.substack.com/p/the-meta-crises-and-digital-identity#:~:text=The%20major%20tech,ability%20to%20vote.)

> "Simply put, identity is the commanding heights of social power. Your identity is the means by which you access the resources of the institutional world. Have your identity stolen, and you’ll understand exactly what I’m talking about. As that identity goes digital, more and more of your life will flow through it and all of this will become data for “the algorithm”. In just the same fashion that digital advertising is orders of magnitude more powerful (and insidious) than old fashioned newspaper or TV ads, the powers of digital identity (including digital money and digital politics) are of a different order. As the CCP knows very well, control over these flows is the most powerful form of social power that has yet been devised.
>
> I want to emphasize that none of this requires bad intent. No conspiracies needed. Simply the observation: if we have a tool, we will use it. Digital identity is powerful. And power will be used. It is not a question, for example, of whether our social future will be influenced by some kind of social credit system. This is as inevitable a consequence of digital identity as spam is a consequence of email or political parties are a consequence of democratic process. The question is the governance and architecture of that power. There are some futures of digital identity that are technofascist dystopias. But there are others that present quite a different, better, possibility. Ones where that same power leads to increasingly free and sovereign selves." - [The Meta-Crises and Digital Identity, by Jordan Hall](https://deepcode.substack.com/p/the-meta-crises-and-digital-identity#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20identity,and%20sovereign%20selves.)

> • Fabricate reality. We are already beginning to see our ability to rely on image and video “proof” of events soften. As AI proceeds, we run a real risk of not being able to believe anything in the media.

>
> 1. We must be able to reliably distinguish between an authentic human and a bot.

> 2. We must be able to reliably trace each and every piece of content to a specific point of origin (this is called “provenance”). For example, we must be able to be certain that a given video was created by some particular creator (human or otherwise) and has not been modified.
>
> 3. We must be able to durably attach trust and permissions to virtual/digital identities that provably are tied to the same real identity over time. For example, if I trust you, I have to be certain that the next time I interact with the identity that I associate with you, that it really is still you (i.e., it hasn’t been stolen or sold).

> "The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress—the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system’s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness). Defined in this way, “stress” turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term duḥkha (otherwise often rendered as “suffering”), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so duḥkha is a continuous state that compels beings to act. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of “make and maintain a whole limb” of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives. It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=The%20central%20treadmill,of%20other%20beings.)

In this scheme, compassion (in the sense of practical concern) and intelligence are tightly linked because the driving definition of an active agent is the bundle of processes that expend energy toward system-level goals. The scale and content of what a given agent measures, prefers, and seeks to implement define its cognitive sophistication." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=Stress%20drives%20agents,its%20cognitive%20sophistication.)

This model leaves out many of the mechanistic details of the actual phenomenon of attention, and instead depicts a mysterious, physically impossible property – awareness.

"individuals as neurons" chapter
the current host-centric world where platforms own our data and is siloed is preventing us as a giant global brain to wire any way we want


THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?








index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes




"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"




== The global connectome

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

we have maladaptive connections and lack (neuro)plasticity. The global brain lacks (neuro)plasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity



we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
inherit algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!




we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy








we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)























youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.













We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types - even if we have just watched a video like that?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?































https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory




== Computable context & SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs

what if we could see all the unique assertions a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that? What if we could analyze how their views changed throughout time?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts

what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?











shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"










we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability












Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations











deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

Accounts are integers and the state tree should reflect that - doesnt need to be a trie based on crypto addresses

1.3mb/s data availability for celestia requires 1gb/s speed

- unsure:
    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)
        - in-protocol incentivization?

- transition path for my project? different DA layer and moving away from the EigenLayr smart contracts?

- DataLayr
    - is the DA layer shared by all rollups using DataLayr and will they fight for resources?
        - will many separate rollups on DataLayr share the same 10MB/s of DA throughput that has been achieved on the testnet with 100 nodes?
    - direct IPs and not using a p2p layer?
        - could DataLayr have been p2p and without public IPs?
        - how come DoS attacks are avoided too? mentioned here: https://youtu.be/OtUOXTqrSyg?t=1542

- Q: why is it hard to hard-fork a standalone chain but easier if consensus & DA are coming from Celestia?

██████ unsorted

TODO: what about small entities like "year progress" - should they get a unique ID on-chain? Or some other light-weight account type should exist? maybe an "owned" off-chain index that's a child of the creator?

There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes
== ideas for apps:
- feed composer - from subscriptions - with pipes


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color




The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet




What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



unlocking the potential of the internet

Aiming to make politics downstream of science - not the other way around

Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.


apps that consume private indexes but done according to public rules and get them uniquely fingerprinted so that leaks are detected, those apps can stake a token in something escrow-like with an amount determined by market forces, and those that produce the indexes and give them with unique fingerprints could slash and/or confiscate their stake


> "Open state is the next step after open source. You don’t just release a copy of the frontend, you let anyone read and write to the same backend." - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1632833998442614784)



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model


2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership


Public actions should be regarded as public contributions



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"



global questions will have URIs that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"


NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing


make a mission section with a bunch of mission statements - that all come together in a whole


being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.


move from @handle to full names in citations in the book

So many ideas that can be implemented as a hackaton at any of the big social media companies are never even attempted - because it doesn’t serve their bottom line. Thats why the host-centric model must go

Logo/Cover photo idea: headjack which extends as a vortex/fractal of interconnectedness

== double addressing?
headjack://app_id/nonce/user_id/content_id
headjack2://user_id:concept_id


when we give a universal address to any item extensibility becomes trivial. Suppose you have a list of movies and you want to edit it in a way that's not allowed by the UI - what if you could write a script to fetch it, process it and re-upload the new version?


The 2 dirtiest words when it comes to the Twitter API: "rate limited" - read "innovation & insight limited"

The google index for public data is private - it should be public infrastructure

fine-grained control
When viewing a post - have the ability to choose wether to respect the OP’s blocks and not see comments from blocked users or not


Economics is downstream of coordination


there isn't an ounce of fat to remove from this design - anything more minimalistic would complicate the mental model for working with the system.

!! NOT REALLY - identity


== clips
== improving audio & video

if someone uploads a clip someone can link it to the original content with timeline mapping so that one can view the original instead of the clip if they wish - similar to the "title change for less clickbait" stuff
"DISINCENTIVIZING DUPLICATION"
Todo: chapter about the movie maker - the timeline composer
clips are dysfunctional
clips are reuploaded because uploaders would get the revenue... this needs a solution

a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ... just kidding.

What happens to URIs with names that get used in a blob which doesnt get anchored immediately and name ownership changes before it gets anchored?
