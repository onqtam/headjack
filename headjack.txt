> "Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up—from the pieces to the whole, from cell to organ to organism, from individual to team, from actual production to management of production. Early farmers decided to come together and form cities for self-protection and for making trade more efficient. Life started with single-cell bacteria, not with elephants. The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating subsystems do their jobs better. This is something, unfortunately, that both the higher and the lower levels of a greatly articulated hierarchy easily can forget. Therefore, many systems are not meeting our goals because of malfunctioning hierarchies." - [Thinking in Systems 2008, by Donella Meadows](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/fragments-vertebrate-technology#:~:text=Hierarchies%20evolve%20from,of%20malfunctioning%20hierarchies)

> "What is needed to make this immense sensing, valuing, and acting capability available for intelligence is to interconnect these people and tools via a vast and powerful network. That network too already exists, in the form of the Internet: any information collected or decision made by any human or technological agent(s) can in principle be transmitted nearly instantaneously to any other agent(s) for further processing and/or enacting. The amount of information propagating across this global network is many orders of magnitude larger than the most powerful channel we could envisage to feed a single AI, however advanced its processing capacity." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf)

> "Just like the neural networks in our brain, the global network processes this information in a distributed manner, with billions of human and technological “neurons” working in parallel—on partly the same, partly different data—while aggregating their results into collective decisions and  actions. Unlike the centralized, tightly controlled systems imagined by AI theorists, this network functions like a complex adaptive system: a decentralized, selforganizing whole formed by an immense variety of interacting agents. This makes the overall system much more powerful, robust, and adaptive than a preprogrammed central processor that takes in information sequentially. As it adapts, this network learns from its experience by expanding and extending the most useful technologies, ideas, links, institutions, and agents, while setting aside and eventually forgetting the less useful ones. Moreover, it learns to ever better coordinate the activities of its components, by creating ever more direct and more powerful links between them. It thus increases its own intelligence. This increase can only accelerate as a more powerful and intelligent network also expands and develops more quickly." - [Return to Eden?

> "The most successful attempt to date at organizing this knowledge is Wikipedia, the global encyclopedia that is being read, written and edited by millions of volunteers worldwide. The basis of its success is [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a mechanism of self-organizing coordination between independent agents. The principle is that the work of one individual (e.g. an edit of a Wikipedia text) leaves a public trace (e.g. a change in the corresponding web page) that can stimulate one or more other individuals to continue the work (e.g. add further details or correct wrong assumptions). Thus, independent contributions build further the one on top of the other, producing a collective result much richer and more complex than could have been achieved via any traditional, centralized form of organization. There are no obvious limits to such a self-amplifying process of contributions eliciting further contributions." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf)

> "An essential part of that knowledge will be about the superorganism as a whole: how does the world function, and what opportunities and dangers can we anticipate? This requires, first, a general, transdisciplinary theory of complex systems and their networks of interactions: a global systems science. This theory would then be implemented as a living earth simulator: a comprehensive computer model of global society, the planetary ecosystem, and the way they interact. Such a simulation would allow us to anticipate the effects of different events or interventions on the global superorganism. That would make it possible to formulate a nearly optimal trajectory for global development, while as much as possible steering clear of conceivable obstacles, catastrophes, and negative side effects. However, in order to remain up to date and to adapt to unforeseen disturbances, this model would need to be constantly fed with new data. Moreover, it should be able to test out its hypotheses in the real world, so as to correct possibly inaccurate assumptions. A we noted earlier, this would require a very high-bandwidth interaction network, which Helbing call a planetary nervous system." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf)

> "A global brain should be able to monitor what is happening everywhere in the world at any moment, so as to extract the relevant information for anticipating what will happen next.

> "Not just printers and other assemblers can be directed remotely via distributed intelligence: people, robots, and any Internet-enabled objects that have effectors can be mobilized to perform the right actions at the right time in the right place, and this in a smooth, coordinated manner. The many communities of volunteers on the Internet illustrate that it suffices to formulate a worthwhile objective and to provide an effective collaboration platform to get people to work efficiently towards the most ambitious targets. These include writing down all the world’s knowledge (Wikipedia), programming the software to run the Web (Apache, Linux, …), or supporting start-ups, pro-democracy movements, or charities with money, ideas and volunteer work. An extension of the underlying techniques for encouraging and coordinating such beneficial activity should allow the GB to harness people worldwide to tackle any kind of challenge." - [Return to Eden?

think about how the material of RethinkX would fit in this epistemological ecosystem

we can incentivize people to fill out questions to "complete their profile" and nudge them towards answering "top 10 civilizational concerns" - something they might have never even thought about. Some would perhaps look around at what scientists have had to say and boost their answers - hopefully, few would turn to kim kardashian for that sort of question

delegating your vote to someone that you agree with can be more impactful than voting directly because it elevates them and their arguments and narrows down the set of arguments for a debate - making things more manageable

social norms are the most powerful mechanism to leverage change

"Cooperation & transparency" as the One Commandment

This is how the internet is turned into a neural net

just like Data Availability layers allow for higher-level modular blockchain forking without much infrastructure hassle, the same way communities can fork with different models that treat & interpret the same set of events differently

Internet 2.0 is a global neural net centered around identity

A agent-weighted library of Alexandria

Integrated information processing

Social media 1.0 was designed for consumption - what if we designed it for expressivity, meaning, creation, collaboration and epistemic coherence & compounding?

We can publicly entice/bribe corporations with greater memetic distribution to align with our goals

Objective reputation has to be a cornerstone


Radical markets for names?

Money is under the control of misaligned, corrupt, dysfunctional and incompetent governments and banks. Status is under the control of media and money. We can redesign status as a new type of flexible currency thats evolvable to whatever we need it to be

What if we obsoleted the money-on-money-return game in favor of status-on-status-return built on top of competence, accountability and cooperation - the infinite game, not one bound to resources?

The internet & the digital in their final form as a memetic evolutionary substrate - no architectural restrictions

One of the dials could be status vs virality of an event as a spectrum

the only enemy is entropy

separate "severity/importance" and "likelihood", so that we can weight in on these 2 aspects separately

resiliency! can survive internet partitioning like the Chinese firewall if the chain is only on one end - data can be created & made addressable by an application on one side of the internet, then they sign a transaction to anchor the data to the chain, then that anchoring transaction and all the data can be physically moved on some storage device to the other part of the internet & the anchoring transaction can be submitted - now both sides can address the same events the same way. Just like IPFS.

we can vote and agree on what is acceptable and what is not - a big taxonomy of unacceptability - and then use that shared standard to rank online actions

A participatory incentive design system for societies and our civilization

Internet of people/influencers ==> internet of ideas

UH - united humanity

The terms of the debt jubilee will be dictated by the global brain

A socially wired global neural network

the race to the top on transparency

One commandment: epistemic health

Whistleblowing should play

The one commandment: most people are good

Bashing utopias as unrealistic and dangerous by pointing to epistemologically bankrupt historic examples that lead to catastrophes is a limiting & self-manifesting/reinforcing belief
It also lacks any imagination and attempt for creativity

The belief that utopian visions are dangerous is a dangerous belief

Turning the other cheek is a metaphor for escaping the dictates of your immediate impulses and motivations. Resisting temptation - the evolutionarily installed impulses that were useful in past evolution.
We need to learn from religious movements and apply the insights to a materialistic worldview

This is the Manhattan project for reclaiming our consciousness

We can score a NYT piece on a multitude of factors - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations

What if we treated media like science - requiring citations and quotes for everything?

Epistemic architecture



epistemic crisis - a crisis of knowledge

despite the overwhelming amounts of information available to us - we are more polarized than ever and it is harder to separate fact from fiction

What about the Fermi paradox? Perhaps life everywhere else couldn’t build the global brain.

Motivated reasoning should be abolished/countered/made visible

We can reward pre-commitments how data will be treated

Top 10 ways to improve X field/concept/entity

Think of how current services (science journals, stack exchange websites) can make it so the reputation of someone can be linked to their identity of choice & made addressable & exportable so that it can be fed into models

People are conditioned into passivity, cynicism and helplessness

A distributed and participatory social landscape

A participatory social operating system

The lack of shared intentionality - a shared worldview - is perhaps our fundamental issue

Some of the quotes in this book are probably misattributed - wouldn't it be nice to be able to cryptographically prove their provenance by quoting a part of the source text linked to identity?

btw още няколко неща които ще може да се правят ако експрес-ваме семантично идеите - освен да се изчисли score спрямо някакъв модел/правила и някаква база данни от "факти", ще може човек сам да си дебъг-ва мислите като търси логически конфликти, и ще може да прави diff спрямо идеите на някой друг - да види % препокриване и съгласие (както и конфликт).
и ще може да query-ваш кои други имат еди какво си мнение

we can have tribunals for claims of corruption and reward journalists & investigators who correctly (according to a tribunal of our choice) map such instances in the real world to entities

Unification of entities/concepts/events and the ability to aggregate and open access to freely compose, associate and extend the data and functionality are a way to fix asymmetries of power

Levels of openness & alignment - different rewards by the network
- Sharing patents?
- Open source?
- Permissive license? License to others in this ecosystem?
- Planned obsolescence? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5v8D-alAKE
- using hypernormal stimuli?
ESG scores
- pressure/incentivize a basket of companies to pool capital and fund some research so that the funding is distributed, and also define for them all of the areas that need research so that the companies aren't selective for what suits them.

imagine if the insights and conclusions of any book or long-form media were encoded in the giant epistemological graph and you could see which parts of the world are affected, where there is consensus/conflict, etc.

what if the whole system recalculates everything automatically when a fact (assumption) changes and based on specific criteria sends appropriate notifications - showing a diff & implications of the changes?
What if a core fundamental assumption you have gets overturned - wouldn't you want to know the transitive impact of that change?

Examples for feeds: 1) friends, 2) interests (and for different interests - finance/hobbies), 3) groups

> "Somehow problem solvers reliably (but not perfectly) zero in on the relevant information to be investigated. They do not do this abstractly, but in the way they formulate the problem. How individuals represent the initial state, goal state, operations, and path constraints, is the way in which they attempt to zero in on relevant information. Problem formulation is how problem solvers constrain the search space of a particular problem so that heuristics can effectively apply to it. Problem formulation captures what problem solvers deem relevant to a specific problem, and this formulation helps them to intelligently ignore most of the information in the search space. To intelligently ignore means that problem solvers do not even consider most available information, and they find and focus upon information that turns out to be relevant without comparing it to all the irrelevant information that is available." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Consider how we are beset by ill-defined problems all day long such as following and/or joining a conversation successfully, getting and/or telling a joke or telling a story. As such, we frequently have to generate problem formulations in order to both address ill-definedness and to avoid combinatorial explosion. Not only do we have to zero in on relevant information, we often have to generate missing relevant information in order to do so. Problem formulation handles both of these demands and is a primary way in which we do relevance realization within problem solving.
>
> However, sometimes the problem formulation constrains a problem in such a way so that it cannot be solved; the problem formulation itself becomes problematic. In these circumstances, the problem formulations need to be broken up and reformulated. The solver must have an insight: their relevance realization abilities have to be flexibly recursive and self-correcting. They have to realize that they have misformulated the problem and be capable of generating a new relevance profile that then informs a new, more effective formulation." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "We never represent all the properties of anything because we are in the finitary predicament. We always only represent a subset of any real world things. This subset of features and how they hang together is an aspect. All representation is aspectual. Yet an aspect is a zeroing in on properties deemed relevant, and a formulation of those properties as highly relevant to each other and to oneself and others. The ability to represent crucially presupposes the ability to realize relevance and therefore cannot serve as a basis of explaining it without circularity." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Relevance realization must be happening at a level of analysis more basic than standard information processing. Yet it cannot be handled by some central processor because that processor would face a combinatorial explosion of information facing it even within the brain’s own processing. The processing of relevance realization has to happen as a constraint on all processing both local and global within the brain. Relevance realization has to be internal, sub-semantic, sub-syntactic, and scale invariant in its operations. Finally, it must be completely self-organizing because it has to be a self-correcting and self-transforming process." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "McKee and Barber note that it is not just any kind of insight that constitutes wisdom. Rather it is some kind of insight through illusion and into reality. Meeks and Jeste indicate that the insight involved in wisdom also has importantly to do with self‐reflection/self‐understanding. The connection here is that illusion is some form of self‐deception, so seeing through illusion and into reality involves important insight into one’s own cognition and how it might be impeding contact with reality." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions. Taken together, combinatorial complexity in problem solving, the largely ill-defined nature of most problems and the consideration of consequences serve to indicate the centrality of our relevance realization machinery. Thus, relevance realization is central; it involves the ability to frame our cognition and, most importantly, to do this flexibly, i.e. to be able to reframe. This ability to reframe how we find things relevant is sometimes experienced as the “aha” moment called insight." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Relevance realization is always a matter of the selective direction of attention, the appraisal of value, and the rationing and commitment of processing resources.

Who benefits the most from fractured & incoherent epistemic commons and uncoordinated & uneducated masses?

there are no secret laws. We should be able to work on them in public, transparently and accountably

Status economics

We can reward companies when they contribute private data to the public commons
Power is with the people to vote how to score entities - not with infra providers and applications which want more advertising dollars and have a conflict of interest

Ending destructive competition and unifying humanity makes sense. How do we build the global brain?

We need to gamify the contribution to a coherent and unified knowledge base 

Concepts and events are singular and unique, opinions are subjective and multi-perspectival

What is our civilizational objective function?

Rejecting the rule of hypocrites and psychopaths is moral

Society has a balance sheet - lets crowdsource it


People are used to and reduced to passive consumption - recommendation engines

structurally removing the capacity for corruption through technology

a causal map can reveal the fundamental generator functions of our biggest problems

identify perverse incentives, multipolar traps, coordination failures, and destructive competition

society's signal amplification method is broken

signaling at different scales - locally, nationally, globally - trying to tell different things to different group sizes

The elephant in the room is human alignment



Bitcoin and appchains (the first wave) vs ethereum & fully programmable chains (& even modular designs)
Analogy: all the different social media apps vs a unified identity layer and permissionless composability. This is the final abstraction


If the left and right really dont want to share the same town hall - they can have two different models for the state (built from the events)

What an open identity layer lacks in control over product and customer experience, it makes up for with permissionless composability, reusing the same social graph and efficiency UNIX-style 

concern/challenge: recalculating the state from past events based on different criteria will become more costly as time goes by - leading to ossification and inertia in changing the rules. Perhaps it should be done with a sliding window

Just because everybody can be a writer on public blockchains doesn’t mean that they should

Family/Community accounts? Dad/CEO owns the account of children/employees and can move them to a different IDM in a single tx? But what about the metadata leak?

> If you and a friend Snap back and forth for consecutive days, you build up a streak which is tracked in your friends list. Young people quickly threw their heart and souls into building and maintaining streaks with their friends. This was literally proof of work as proof of friendship, quantified and tracked.
>
> Streaks, of course, have the wonderful quality of being unbounded. You can maintain as many streaks as you like. If you don't think social capital has value, you've never seen, as I have, a young person sobbing over having to go on vacation without their phone, or to somewhere without cell or wifi access, only to see all their streaks broken. Some kids have resorted, when forced to go abroad on a vacation, to leaving their phone with a friend who helps to keep all the streaks alive, like some sort of social capital babysitter or surrogate.
>
> What's hilarious is how efficiently young people maintain streaks. It's a daily ritual that often consists of just quickly running down your friend list and snapping something random, anything, just to increment the streak count. My nephew often didn’t even bother framing the camera up, most his streak-maintenance snaps were blurry pics of the side of his elbow, half his shoulder, things like that.
>
> Of course, as evidence of the fragility of social capital structures, streaks have started to lose heat. Many younger users of Snapchat no longer bother with them. Maintaining social capital games is always going to be a volatile game, prone to sudden and massive deflationary events, but while they work, they’re a hell of a drug. They also can be useful; for someone Snapping frequently, like all teens do, having a best friends list sorted to the top of your distribution list is a huge time-saver. Social capital and utility often can’t be separated cleanly." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Remember%20Snapchat%27s%20original,be%20separated%20cleanly.)

A religion about service to the collective - backed by a complete scientific argumentation and imbued with error correction as the core principle

We need to cohere around what we should do as a civilisation - using the scientific method every step of the way 

Nurturing your digital twin - your alter ego

Life and evolution have a direction - towards greater scales of cooperation and greater evolvability - transcendence

What should we do as civilisation? We should teach our kids the general principles that would help them self-actualize and we should have a causal map of the world along with the brst possible training materials for any field - so kids can choose their direction

The one commandment: consequence capture, fairness and cooperation

Fractal knowledge - zoom however much you want to go deeper

We need to allow the next generations to grown into their rightful place in the hierarchy and avoid gerontocracy
Science advances one funeral at a time

Error correction, conscious evolution, scientific method
Fauci is not science

The essence of spirituality and transcendence is the feeling of being a part of something greater than one self. We can feel the calling of evolution’s arrow towards greater levels of aggregation and cooperation

The only competition we should be engaged in should be in the pursuit of doing things and serving others better - not owning more just for the sake of owning and feeding the ego

A ruthless pursuit of excellence in the service to others

We need to ground our civilization on the pursuit of truth

Error correction is the noblest of pursuits


Consequence capture is imperative for humanity

satoshi nakamoto Nobel prize lex quote - for peace, because of fairness


we need to rebuild our civilization around consequence capture
our civilization needs to gradually morph into one that has consequence capture as a foundation

money and markets are about the transfer of energy (ownership) and are an informational layer of humanity. Reputation, status and knowledge are a complementary informational layer for our global superorganism and they are much more flexible and with higher leverage - a simple idea can transform us and that has happened countless times throughout history
With money and resources the laws of energy conservation play at hand, even though economic growth lifts everybody up through the voluntary transactions of participants. Knowledge is the superior layer.

Ultimate freedom lies when consciousness isn’t burdened by the frame of the ego
That is transcendance

The ego is the jailor of consciousness

You feel whats most true and important because the burden of your beliefs is lifted - when the ego dissolves - thats when consciousness is free from any frame

By birthing a global conscoiusness we’d be able to ask what is most relevant

We want a new attractor which is: how do we utilize the new exponential technologies - the whole suite of them - to build new systems of collective intelligence, new better systems of social technology. How do you make a [fourth estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Estate) that can really adequately educate everyone in a post Facebook world? Well, the same way that we're trying to optimize control patterns of human behavior for market purposes to get them to buy certain things and to direct their attention, could that be used educationally? Of course it could, if it was being developed for that purpose. And the AI tech... could it take semantic fields of people's propositions and values and create a proposition that is kind of the semantic center of the space? We can't all fit into a town hall but can we engage in digital spaces where we can have better processes of proposing refinements to the propositions? Of course we can. Could we use blockchain and other types of uncorruptable ledgers to solve corruption which is something that universally everybody thinks is a good idea? Should all government money be on a blockchain - the movement of it - so you have provenance so you can see where the money's actually going and if someone wants to be a private contractor they have to agree that the accounting system - if they want government money - goes on the blockchain, so we can see the entire provenance of the taxpayer money. Really you can't have representation if there isn't transparency of how it happens. When you start to think about attention directing technology and what its pedagogical applications could be, when you start to think about AI and how it could actually help proposition development and parsing huge amounts of information to make a better epistemic commons, when you start to think about blockchain and could we actually resolve corruption using uncorruptable ledgers and making the provenance of physical supply chains and information and money all flow across those - totally new possibilities start to emerge that were never possible before." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/wO1WVguNQAM?t=4588)

> "So let's say we take the attention tech that you've looked at so much that when it is applied for a commercial application is seeking to gather data to both maximize time on site and maximize engagement with certain kinds of ads and whatever - that's obviously the ability to direct human behavior and direct human feeling and thought. In a way that is both emerged out of capitalism and has become almost a new macroeconomic structure more powerful than capitalism, because even more powerful than being able to incent people's behavior with money is being able to direct what they think and feel, to where the thing that they think of as their own intrinsic motive has actually been influenced or captured. So if we wanted to apply that type of technology and we figured out how to make the kind of transparency that made institutions that were trustworthy enough that we could trust them with this - and already we have institutions that have it that we have no basis to trust with it - could that same tech be used educationally, to be able to personalize education to the learning style of a kid or to an adult - to their particular areas of interest - and to be able to not use the ability to control them for game theoretic purposes, but use the ability to influence them, to even help them learn what makes their own center, their locus of action more internalized, right - we could teach people with that kind of tech how to notice their own bias, how to notice their own emotional behaviors, how to notice groupthink type dynamics, how to understand propaganda, media literacy. So could we actually use those tools to increase people's immune system against bad actors use of those tools? Totally. Could we use them pedagogically in general to be able to identify rather than manufacturing desires in people or appealing to the lowest angels of their nature because addiction is profitable, can you appeal to the highest angels and people's nature but that are aligned with intrinsic incentives and be able to create customized educational programs that are based on what each person is actually innately intrinsically motivated by, but that are their higher innate motivators? Everybody can have a reward circuit that is based on - you know - chocolate cake and sloth, but the immediate spike that comes from the chocolate cake ends up then having a crash and increased weight and inflammation and whatever, where the baseline of their happiness goes down over time - even though every time they eat the chocolate cake they get a spike. The exercise reward circuit is maybe not that fun - maybe even kind of painful and dreadful in the moment - but then creates a higher baseline of energy and capacity and endurance and self-esteem and you start to actually have the process become more fun, you get a new reward circuit, and the baseline goes up. So of course I can appeal to the lower reward circuit and say 'hey I'm just giving people what they want' - yeah but if you have a billion dollar or a trillion dollar organization that is preying upon them - and you discuss this very well all the time - the vulnerabilities that make people's life worse to then have the plausible deniability to say 'yeah but they wanted it' - yeah but it was a manufactured demand and a vulnerability - where's the noblesse oblige, where's the obligation of having that much power to actually be a good steward of power - a steward of that for other people - where if there are reward circuits that decrease the quality of their life, reward circuits that increase it, that we are trying to appeal to one rather than the other - could we do that? Yeah, totally we could. Could we have an education system as a result that was identifying innate aptitudes, innate interests of everyone and facilitating their development so not only did they become good at something but they became increasingly more intrinsically motivated, fascinated, and passionate by life which also meant continuously better at the thing - well in a world of increasing technological automation coming up - both robotic and AI automation where so many of the jobs are about to be obsoleted - our economy and our education system have to radically change to deal with that, because one of the core things an economy has been trying to do forever was deal with the need that a society had for labor force and there were these jobs that society needed to get done that nobody would really want to do, so either the state has to force them to do it or you have to make it where the people also need the job - so there's a symmetry and so kind of the market forces them to do it. Well when you technologically automate those jobs - and it happens to be that the things that are the most wrote are the least fun for people and the easiest to program machines to do - and so if you keep the same economy where if people don't produce they don't have any basic needs met, then people want those crappy jobs, right, but if you make it to where they have other opportunities - then of course having those jobs be automated is fine. But what does it mean to really be able to have other better opportunities? So if one of the fundamental axioms of all of our economic theories is that we need to figure out how to incent to labor force to do things that nobody wants to do and emerging technological automation starts to debase that - that means we have to rethink economics from scratch because we don't have to do that thing anymore. So maybe if now the jobs don't need the people, can we remake a new economic system where the people don't need the jobs? Can we start to create commonwealth resources that everyone has access to where people's access isn't based on possession that automatically limits everyone else's access? If you get around transportation wise with a car based on owning that car with the vast majority of the life of the car it's just sitting - not being used - for you to have access to the car you have to have possession of it, which means that it's a mostly under utilized asset - I don't have access to the thing that you possess. Now what we see with Uber of course is a situation where your access is not mediated by your possession. So now turn that into electric self-driving cars and now make the entire thing on a blockchain so you disintermediate even the central business, make it a commonwealth resource, and everyone has access to transportation as a commonwealth resource - it'll take a twentieth of the number of cars to meet the same level of convenience during peak demand time, so much less environmental harm - it'll actually be more convenient because I don't have to be engaged in driving the thing and there's less traffic because of coordination and better maintenance and there isn't an incentive for design and obsolescence in that system. You can see a situation where okay, can we make it to where the wealth augmenting capacity of that technological automation goes back into a commonwealth because we don't have to have the same axioms of needing to incent the people - 'oh yeah but if you don't incent the people they'll all be lazy welfare people' - nonsense. Einstein didn't do what he did based on economic incentive and neither did Mozart and neither did Gandhi and none of the people that we are most inspired by through history were doing that, and what kids who will spend so much time doing where they ask questions about why this, why this, why this, and building forts and whatever is intrinsic motive - it's just we don't facilitate the things that they're interested in - we try to force them to be interested in things they aren't interested in - that's what ends up breaking their interest in life and then they just want a hyper-normal stimuli and play video games, whatever. What if you had a system that was facilitating their interest the entire time? Now you have a situation where you can start to decrease the total amount of extrinsic incentive in the system as a whole, use the technology, the automation to decrease the need for extrinsic incentive and make an educational system and culture that's about optimizing intrinsic incentive, because if my needs are already met getting stuff and everybody's needs are met through access to commonwealth resources there's no real status conferred - there's only status confirmed by what I create. So now any status is bound to a kind of creative imperative. That's an example. We can look at blockchain tech even more near term and say... but just to come back to this technological automation thing: so obviously it makes possible changing economics and changing education, but also what is the role of humans in a post AI robotic automation world because that is coming very very soon, and what is the future of education where you don't have to prepare people to be things that you can just program computers to be - well the role of education has to be based on what is the role of people in that world. That is such a deep redesign of civilization because the tech is changing the possibility set that deeply. So at the heart of this are kind of deep existential questions of what is a meaningful human life and then what is a good civilization that increases the possibility space of that for everybody and how do we design that thing? We come back to blockchain and we say well blockchain is an uncorruptable ledger. Well one thing that the left and right and everybody agrees on is that corruption happens and it's bad for the society as a whole we don't like it - we just disagree on who does it. Is it possible that that tech could make possible decreasing corruption as a whole - it actually decreases the possibility set for corruption? Yeah - in order to do corruption I have to be able to hide that I did it - right - I either have to break enforcement or break accounting, and mostly it's break accounting. And so what if all government spending was on a blockchain and it doesn't have to be a blockchain - it has to be an uncorruptable ledger of some kind - Holochain is a good example that is pioneering another way of doing it - but uncorruptable ledger of some kind where you actually see where all taxpayer money goes and you see how it is utilized - the entire thing can have independent auditing agencies and the public can transparently be engaged in the auditing of it. And if the government is going to privately contract a corporation, the corporation agrees that if they want that government money, the blockchain accounting has to extend into the corporation, so there can't be - you know - very very bloated corruption. Everybody got to see that when Elon made SpaceX all of a sudden he was making rockets for like a hundreds to a thousandth of the price that Lockheed or Boeing were who had just had these almost monopolistic government contracts for a long time. Well if the taxpayer money is going to the government, is going to an external private contractor who's making the things for a hundred to a thousand times more than it costs, we get this false dichotomy sold to us that either we have to pay more taxes to have better national security, or if we want to cut taxes we're gonna have less national security. What about just having less gruesome bloat because you have better accounting and we make the rockets for a hundredth of the price and we have better national security and better social services and less taxes? Well, everyone would vote for that, right, who wouldn't vote for that thing. Well that wasn't possible before uncorruptable ledgers. Now that uncorruptable ledger also means you can have provenance on supply chains to make the supply chains close loop so that you can see that all the new stuff is being made from old stuff and you can see where all the pollution is going and you can see who did it which means you can now internalize the externalities rigorously and nobody can destroy those emails or burn those files. What if the changes in law and the decision-making processes also followed a blockchain process where there was a provenance on the input of information - well that would also be a very meaningful thing to be able to follow. So this is an example of like can we actually structurally remove the capacity for corruption by technology that makes corruption much much much harder, that forces types of transparency on auditability? What if also you're able to record history - you're able to record the events that are occurring in a blockchain that's uncorruptable where you can't change history later, so you actually get the possibility of real justice in real history and multiple different simultaneous timelines that are happening - that's humongous in terms of what it does. What if you can have an open data platform and an open science platform where someone doesn't get to cherry pick which data they include in their peer-reviewed paper - later we get to see all of the data that was happening - we solve the oracle issues that are associated, and then if we find out that a particular piece of science was wrong later we can see downstream everything that used that output as an input and automatically flag what things need to change - that's so powerful! Like the least interesting example of blockchain is currency creation. These are actual like... the capacity for the right types of accounting means the right type of choice making. Let's take AI - with AI we can make super terrible deep fakes and destroy the episemic commons, you know using that and other things like that, but we can see the way that the AI makes the deep fake - by being able to take enough different images of the person's face and movements that it can generate new ones, we can see where it can generate totally new faces averaging faces together - somebody sent me some new work that they were just doing on this the other day I found very interesting - they said we're going to take a very similar type of tech and apply it to semantic fields where we can take everybody's sentiment on a topic and actually generate a proposition that is at the semantic center, or take everybody's sentiment and abstract from it the values that they care about and create values taxonomies and say 'we should come up with a proposition that meets all these values'. Then can you have digital processes where you can't fit everybody into a into a town hall but everybody who wants to can participate in a digital space that rather than vote 'yes' or 'no' on a proposition that was made by a special interest group where we didn't have a say in the proposition or even the values it was seeking to serve, so it was made in a very narrow way that like we mentioned earlier - benefits one thing and harms something else - which is why almost every proposition gets about half of the vote and inherently polarizes the population. Well people are so dumb and so rivalrous the process of voting with bad propositions and bad representation process is inherently polarizing and downgrading to people. So what if there's a process by which there's a decision that wants to be made: you start by identifying what are the values everybody cares about and then we say 'the first proposition that meets all these values well becomes the thing that we vote on' and then instead of just a direct vote do we engage types of qualified and liquid democracy together where you have to show that you understand the basics of that topic to be able to vote on it, but the education is free and you can keep retesting, and the basics don't show leaning one way or the other - just shows you understand the stated pros and cons so that massive populism doesn't happen. But if you don't want to come to understand it you can cede your vote to someone else who has passed that thing. That type of liquid democracy, that type of qualified educated democracy where it doesn't have to be educated across everything - it can be per issue - and where you're not just voting on a thing - you're helping craft the propositions - these completely change the possibility space of social technology we could go on and on in terms of examples but these are ways that the same type of new emergent physical tech that can destroy the epistemic commons and create autocracies and create catastrophic risks could also be used to realize a much more pro-topic world." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/wO1WVguNQAM?t=4793)

> "One of the challenges of solving the multipolar trap internationally is the inability to make international agreements and one of the reasons where either we don't make the international agreement because it's not even worth making because we're sure they're going to defect on it so why even bother, or we make the agreement knowing that they're going to defect on it and we're going to defect on it but we're going to say that we're keeping it and we know they're going to say they're keeping it we're going to spy on them and we're going to lie to their spies and all this kind of waste that goes into that - if the transparency to know what they were actually doing and them to know what we were doing was there, the ability to make and keep the agreement would be fundamentally different. So underneath multipolar traps is the perverse game theory to orient towards opaqueness rather than transparency and this is - you know-  the whole nature of how many things are considered trade secrets in the market or national security secrets and - you know-  all of the different types of security clearance and classification and special compartmentalized information and whatever, because we're trying to have information advantage - information asymmetry advantage on the other side and we don't want them to know what we're doing but we do want to know what they're doing and so we invest a lot in this but the opaqueness means that the agreements can't be made so the multi-polar trap is the only thing that is left." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7618)

> "Does the ability to do attribution - specific verifiable attribution of where a particular harm is coming from - does that increase the capacity to create justice, to be able to bind it - totally. So is it possible that certain types of forced transparency can make it to where the ability to hide the harms that then have everyone race to do the harms goes away, and then the fact that they can be shown means there's a need to account for them and better methods of accountability emerge - I think there's a lot that can be done with forced transparency that orients towards a fundamentally better attractor of the game theory space." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7769)

> "Are there ways in which transparent solutions win game theoretically as a different peak in the adaptive landscape relative to the opaque solutions? Why the opaque solutions win is very obvious - surprise attacks help - the ability to advance something where they don't know that we're advancing it, we mislead them about it, they build a false defense - it's obvious why the desire for information asymmetry in that way is there. I was talking to someone in national security of Sweden who was telling me some very fascinating things and I haven't been able to verify all of them, but saying that of kind of the major nations that have meaningful defense capacities Sweden has maybe the most transparent intelligence and military and security apparatus, and their underlying philosophy was that the major players are going to be effective with their spying and know anyways - they don't really get that much information asymmetry - that's more of an illusion of control than a reality of it, and so Russia and China and the U.S. are going to know anyways, and so the huge amount of resource that they would have to put into trying to hide from them is mostly a waste - so they're just not even going to try, and that if you have to try to hide the national security stuff from the quote-unquote enemy that also means you have to hide it from your citizens because otherwise your citizens don't all know how to keep classification which is why this thing pretty much makes democracy impossible in any real sense more than just a simulation. At the time of the founding of modern democracies and particularly I'll mention the United States here, the United States had an ocean on both sides to anybody else, it had no kind of contiguous rival - land contiguous rival - that was a pretty awesome security situation, and so the decisions that needed to be made about anything - including military things - could be shared with the people, the people could actually weigh in on them, and sharing that information with those citizens didn't instantly mean sharing it with the British or the Spanish or anybody else because there was no way to get that information across the ocean quickly, and simultaneously once someone else got that information they couldn't launch an attack that quickly - they'd have to launch boats that we could see that would take months, it would give us time to launch a response, and so the ability to share with the citizens was actually viable in that world because of those sets of reasons. As soon as we get to a world where whatever is being shared with the citizens can be known by rival countries instantly, because of electronic telecommunications and where they can then launch attacks instantly - including ones that are hidden with plausible deniability like cyber attacks or economic attacks or geopolitical positioning, let alone missiles - now the threat of sharing information with the citizens meaning sharing with the rivals is way too high - therefore more and more things become classified more and more things become national security secrets - obviously attacks on our water supply or our energy grid or our food supply could all be national security threats, so we start finding that there's national security secrets fucking everywhere! Well how do you do democracy if the citizens can't actually know what is going on and what the real considerations are - well you can't - it's a simulation of it. This is a real challenge that we have to think of in a deep way when we consider what does a participatory governance system in the context of the modern world look like, because it makes sense that there would be a black budget and it makes sense that there would be national security secrets but then how do you verify that those authorities are not corrupt? How do you verify that they are actually doing the will of the people, or how do you create checks and balances on power or adjudicate issues or things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=7838)

> "When we talk about what is a desirable civilization it becomes a really tricky topic because it's like centrally existential questions, to say what is a good civilization - we don't have a system like science - this is kind of the is/ought distinction where science can say what is but not what ought - we don't have a as powerful as sciences for being able to understand the objective world which then allows us to create objective tech that affects the objective world - we don't have a comparably effective way of studying the subjective and inter-subjective world of being able to say good, right, and so if you have the ability to affect the world exponentially more powerfully through science and applied sciences, technology, but you don't have a comparably powerful force for what is good or wise guidance of that technology then what is guiding that technology ends up being game theory, right, and game theory is actually like the closest thing to something that is commensurable with the scientific system in terms of what is a good choice which is kind of the social darwinism of a good choice as a choice that doesn't lose game theoretically to other choices that are also seeking maximum advantage, but we can see that the advance of game theory under the presence of exponential tech in this way self-terminates so that clearly cannot be called a good choice. And yet losing in the near term is also not a good choice so we need something that is option D - none of the above. So while I think it is important for us to become as good at the type of mind, at the type of internal human capacity that can do wisdom and ethics as we are at the capacity to do science and technology, and to be able to think about what is a desirable civilization, I think we can start by agreeing on a couple things that are not desirable - and I think that's actually very helpful. I think the idea that a civilization that self-terminates is probably doesn't meet the criteria of what an optimal civilization is so that we are wanting to prevent the movements towards cascading catastrophes - that seems pretty straightforward - and that one that is clearly dystopic - meaning that there are such radical asymmetries of power, that the freedoms of almost everyone are radically curtailed - is also not an ideal case. And yet it's very easy to see that exponential tech has the ability to decentralize power as the market cases giving an example of, which creates these coordination collective action problems and multipolar traps, and so the decentralized exponential power creates multipolar traps creates increasing catastrophes. So then it also has the ability to centralize power - if I could have an entire nation-state - historically the nation-state couldn't be too top-down and too big because it would get fragile because you can't actually see what everyone's doing and control it, but the ability to have sensors everywhere and no person could make sense of that and you couldn't even trust the chains of command but AI systems could, and then getting everybody to spy on each other is tricky but being able to mediate that through sesame credit type systems - it could do that thing. So the exponential tech also creates way more powerful autocratic systems at scale - centralizing power - which brings us back to why the multipolar trap is one of the very deep underlying things to work on. And this also brings us back to the Swedish example that I did not complete of where transparency could win. So the example he was giving is that rather than invest any resource in opaqueness or you know hiding or cloaking stuff they would just assume that the rivals would find out anyways and as a result they didn't have to keep stuff from their own population in the same way - as a result the population has a way higher trust in government, as a result way less money has to be spent in campaigning and convincing people of things and there's more kind of emergent coordination and things like that and the various departments of government - and especially of the military - have more transparency to what each other are doing because they're transparent, whereas in the classification you don't just have overarching classification - you have this kind of special compartmentalized information process which means that a general in one area and a general in the other still don't know what's going on in the other domain - so that both means that duplication can be happening, it means that a lack of efficiency of coordination happens, and that particularly when there's too much information it kind of doesn't even matter to have access to all the information because nobody can process it - this is the infosingularity issue and we'll talk about this more. But when we have more computational capacities to process large information sets then it actually really does matter having transparent access to all of it - we can make progressively better sense of it with the right computational sense making augmentation. So their ideas - the transparency regarding things that would have otherwise been classified - doesn't lose us that much - it gains us a lot of trust in government which gains us a lot of discretionary participation of the citizenry and it also gains us the ability for the various departments of government and military to be in much more coordination with less duplication and less waste because they have more transparency to what each other are doing, it also means that it's much easier to check corruption because they increase transparency and so you have more efficiency and integrity and things like that, and as a result you lose the little bit of asymmetry of information advantage but you gain a lot of other kinds of advantages so it's a different peak in the adaptive landscape. I thought this was fascinating when he shared this with me and so I asked - you know - that's cute and all as a country that has EU backing which fundamentally has NATO backing - you know - indirectly, and that is not at the head of an arms race - do you think something like that could work for say the United States? His take was yes - it actually could work for the United States because the amount of capacity uplift that would occur - and this didn't mean he thought it was inactive - the the vested interest against enacting it would be ridiculous - but just hypothetically as a thought experiment if that kind of transparency did happen - the amount of duplication that's occurring is huge, the amount of corruption and waste that's occurring is huge, the ineffectiveness of coordination that could be lifted would be huge, the ability to start getting increased trust in government and as a result having the democratic and government sector be more coherent, aligned with the military sector as opposed to the increasing discoherence in the government public sector, and that even if some first attack capabilities were increased because of the information sharing of other parties - that our total strategic capacity and response and deterrence would still make it or nobody would mess with that that such a thing could be advanced, and I think this is a fascinating line of inquiry. So if say, more total strategic military capacity emerged out of the transparency than the opaqueness approach - meaning per you know, military power per dollar - then it would actually drive a race to the top on transparency where Russia and China would be oriented to try to do a similar thing because otherwise they'd actually be losing the multipolar trap that is now a race to the top on transparency rather than a race to the bottom on opaqueness which is increasing the capacity for international agreement rather than decreasing the capacity and fundamentally addressing the multipolar trap progressively better. If we think about having some forced transparencies through things like international satellite capability and open source intel capacities that kind of mess up the opaqueness anyways - can we make the opaqueness increasingly poor as an adaptive strategy, the transparency both more forced and more capable of actually winning - now we start to get a strategy where for the first time in history possibly something wins game theoretically that is also better in fundamental ways regarding its long-term viability, that the culture more oriented to peacefulness can actually beat the culture more... warring without becoming more warring in all the most problematic ways - it can maintain adequate strategic capacity while being oriented in a way that fundamentally is decreasing the types of pathological competition within the system and as a result driving races to the top between systems of things that are more positive sum and less pathological as a whole. Ultimately whatever... I would say threading the needle of something that is neither catastrophes or dystopias and without being able to wave a magic wand and do enactment at the level of the whole world at once - if any group were to do something the thing they would do has to not lose to the rest of the world not doing that thing - not just not lose but it also has to influence the rest of the world because if let's say we could get some country to do some very enlightened set of practices it still dies from climate change and AI and whatever so long as it doesn't change what the U.S. and Russia and China and other places are doing, so it has to actually be able to influence the whole world shifting but it has to basically be able to win in some critical influence ways where the nature of what creates the win isn't externalizing harm or driving arms races or whatever. So it has to both be obsoleting some kinds of destructive game theory while winning at some fundamental types of game theory at the same time - like so much the threading of the needle has to occur. And I think when we go back to the sub dunbar tribes one of the things that mediated their effective protocols was that there was very high transparency which allowed for pretty good coordination and not having collective action failures within the group - there was no real incentive for anyone to be sociopathic or narcissistic because nobody would want sociopaths or narcissists in the system and unless you can like bullshit people and hide it - that strategy doesn't pay - if everybody can see that you're lying in a small tribal scenario or they can see that you put your trash down or didn't do your part of the chores you're going to clean it up or you're going to get kicked out of the tribe. So that the smallness creates a force transparency, creates a situation in which what is best for the tribe and what's best for you are more closely aligned - I'm not saying perfect, but more closely aligned. When the groups get much larger - where somebody has the ability to play people off of each other who don't know that that's happening because there aren't enough communication channels, and be able to screw some people over here and then go somewhere else to get a new supply of people and whatever, then of course the ability to hide the effects of what I'm doing - I'll create a incentive for sociopathy and things like that, which is why we see that those types of power-oriented say cluster B personality disorders are something like three times more prevalent in C-suites and positions of more power than they are in the general population - it is that they are adaptive in those environments so they're selected for, conditioned, and incentivized. So of course we can get the high transparency and thus better alignment between the individual agents' incentive and the whole in a small environment but that has never scaled." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=8380)

> "If we want to be able to scale it - are some of the new technologies that allow for certain kinds of transparency and then certain kinds of information processing across larger scale and communication? Could they facilitate better methods of collective intelligence that notice perverse incentives and as a result of noticing them and being able to create accounting for them, and externalities - be able to create accounting for them, create progressively better incentives, and more capable deterrence to align the motivations of individual agents with the whole better? I believe so. I believe that some of the exponential computational technologies in particular that portend the fastest and worst existential risks in many ways also portend the possibility for better coordination systems. And I'm not talking about AI disintermediating humans and having some AI singleton run the world - I think that's a really bad idea for lots of reasons. I'm talking about AI being able to facilitate human collective intelligence - AI amongst other capacities. Where I don't want artificial intelligence making the decisions by itself in most scenarios, I want processes of collective intelligence of humans making it, and we can get into obviously people voting yes/no on a binary proposition where both sides/versions of the proposition suck: if it goes through it benefits something and harms something else, if it doesn't go through the thing it would benefit is now harmed because the proposition was just designed stupidly to begin with - it didn't factor how interconnected everything was, so the yes/no on it can't not polarize the population. That's just a stupid system of collective intelligence. We can just do much much better: where before you make a proposition you actually do the sense making of what are all the interconnected things, what are all the values, you take those as design constraints to go through a better proposition crafting process of what is the best synergistic satisfier with the least theory of trade-offs possible, and what are better voting systems than binary that inherently polarize the population. So I think we can do a radically better job of systems of collective intelligence and a radically better job of education of people to be able to participate with these things, and an incentive system where as people become more educated in topics they actually get more ability to influence those topics. We could get into that - it's beyond the scope of this initial introduction. But one of the issues is that where there's more information that anybody can process - the information singularity: there's more journal articles on a topic than any expert can read so nobody can ever be an expert on anything - how do we solve that? One idea is we don't and we simply need AI's to run the world, the other idea is we have to be able to merge with the AIs through some kind of brain computer interface or something like that. I would say another version is that when you look at even the current state of generator AI which is really not advanced compared to what will be a year from now or five years from now because it's advancing so rapidly, but you look at the current state which would be say GPT-3 today (OpenAI) - it can use exclusively natural language input - I don't have to be able to program - I just speak to it, and it understands my words and it does stuff based on understanding the words - that's amazing! Go watch the DALL·E and the GPT-3 demos on YouTube to just get a sense of what they can currently do because it's mind-blowing and the only thing more mind-blowing is the speed at which it's advancing. The destructive capabilities of this don't take thinking very hard to imagine and they're very near-term. The beneficial cases but that are narrow are also really obvious. The omni-beneficial facilitation how do we create better collective intelligence and governance writ large is not as obvious until you really start to think about it but then it is amazing I feel. And this is not a techno optimist answer - I'm very acutely aware that the technology on the current trajectory is most likely catastrophic and what it takes to make the other version of it is value systems that have to be able to bind, guide, and direct it and influence social systems that create the capacity to bind, guide, and direct markets and technology in a way they don't currently have. But it is saying that the technology is new capacity and that that capacity if rightly directed does make new things possible. In the same way that the printing press made democracy possible where it wouldn't have been before because without any newspapers and without textbooks you can't have a comprehensively educated and informed society. When hand copying a book is so hard and expensive - only a nobility class with the wealth can have access to it. Of course that technology of the printing press did make possible different types of coordination than was possible before. Obviously the internet: anybody talked to anybody anywhere in the world & made possible different types of coordination, make possible and orient it to happen that way or different - while most people could use their phone to access any information in the world, what they end up doing on it is usually not that interesting examples because of the nature of the choice architectures that they're engaging with in their user interfaces, and the choice architectures are that the user interfaces that they engage with have goals for them that are other than that person's highest goals for themselves - and they're effective. So this is not AI will save the world, it's also not AI will necessarily destroy the world - this is a: since we have the power to create such powerful technology we need the orientation to think about what wise application of that technology is, and the intersection of comparable wisdom to guide, right, design, and development of that technology that in turn then is developing wisdom and everyone else based on their interface in the same way that Facebook can increase - and it's a known thing: you can change the algorithm that is affecting what's in people's newsfeed and they get more depressed or suicidal or more body image issues or not or because we're affected by what we untake - could we create information platforms that rather than doubling down on my existing bias were oriented to help expose me to information that is antithetical to the things that I currently think but in the most compelling cases so as to increase my kind of dialectical awareness, that rather than orient me to more people that are like the people I already know that orient me to people that are most unlike the people I already know to increase the total connectivity of my network, that rather than maximizing for things like my engagement and time on site it was maximizing for things like as I was showing the capacity to take and synthesize more perspectives the content that did that got upregulated in the algorithm, right, are there ways that that same type of technology could be applied that would be wisdom advancing? Of course this sounds scary because like who's idea of wisdom and who's going to control that, but it's important to get it's already doing it, right, it's already controlling minds at scale. So it's not a question of do we do it or not - it's how do we do it since it is happening. And now the core question of: well how do we adjudicate what is right use of the technology when you realize that the technology is not only radically affecting the earth physically, but radically affecting our mind, society's cultures. Now this again: the wisdom of gods to deal with the power of them becomes central. What is the right use of that? What are wrong uses? Where should that be bound? How do we understand this? How do we make sure that the binding a particular application of a problem doesn't make another worse problem? So we don't like a particular kind of partisan-led censorship, so we want more free speech, but if a particular approach to free speech also means a lot more ubiquitous deep fakes and an upregulation of the worst voices because they get the most tension that creates eliciting of violence and the breakdowns of democracy - it's like: okay, the obvious answers are all wrong, right, because the problem space is more interconnected and more complex, so we have to hold all those problem spaces together and think about it. But we come back to this: you know GPT-3-like AI type tech solving the info singularity - so when you put something to GPT-3 it's not going to find an existing web page for you the way that a search engine would - it can generate bespoke content, right, you can say "write me an article in the voice of such and such with it factoring these kinds of facts and orients towards this kind of conclusion and whatever" and it can do that! And progressively more and more effectively, more and more turing tests passing across more domains. Well what if that just becomes the future of search? Where if I'm searching for the information that could inform a particular choice we're wanting to make, or wanting to do something regarding grid security, but grid security - I need to know all the things about what really affects good security, and what other environmental and national security and you know et cetera issues are connected to that. Right now I can get billions of search results - I can't read billions of search results - that's not useful for me. Can the AI read billions of search results, find the information that is decision informing based on parameters that I'm specifying and create new bespoke content that is the synthesis of that for decision informing - not decision creating. The groups of people doing collective intelligence are still making the decisions, but now with the ability to take a synthesized or refined set of more information than they can process - that is pre-processed into decision-making information - now you say well fuck, who controls that algorithm because that's a big deal? What if you can do it lots of different ways? What if you can put different criteria for how to inform it and in the collective intelligence system all the agents have the capacity to do that kind of thing? There are heaps of challenges and problems that we have to solve here but this is an example of ways that coordination technology... The multi-polar trap is a coordination failure, it's a collective action failure, the dunbar number can be thought of as an upper boundary of a particular type of coordination capacity where everybody can know everybody and see what everybody's doing, talk to everybody, and so the collective activity is able to be bound through very high bandwidth communication. Once we start getting larger than that - early empires - we got command and control hierarchies and we started to get all the problems that we see in the world today, that are now - at the scale that we are - driving catastrophic risks. Democracies where how do we have a much larger system or rather than have somebody at the top rule whether it's one monarch or some small kind of nobility class or whatever - how do we at least have - since we can't get everybody at scale to agree - we could maybe get everybody at a tiny scale to agree but just a minority agreeing seems like a bummer. Can we at least get a majority to agree, but then of course that thing intrinsically ends up driving polarization and its own decay. And so can we make the types of transparency and the types of incentive alignment, the types of capacity for deterrence that would exist at a small tribal type scale possible at much much larger scales where the increase in effective coordination starts to be more effective, right, you start to reduce a huge amount of waste and duplication and failures of those kinds, and so what makes this thing adaptive and selective in a kind of game theoretic situation is also what makes it healthy in terms of the health of the people inside, in terms of classes - people relative to each other - and its relationship with the environment. I think that something like that has to be the answer and I think that it's interesting that the technologies that have the most destructive capability I think also have the most and uniquely facilitative capability for solving collective action or facilitating us solving collective action problems." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/8XCXvzQdcug?t=9142)

> "If we were to talk about what is a third attractor: it's not going to be a top-down singleton which will end up being dystopic, it's not going to be many different actors caught in multiple traps with each other. It's going to be something where the system as a whole has the power to be able to check the catastrophic dynamics within it, but without having power consolidation itself - where the system has a kind of coordination across decentralized capacity, so centralized emergent coordination across lots of decentralized capacities. This is of course the idea of what democracy is trying to achieve and we can see why it was partially successful, and then why it failed and got captured under advancements of technology and complexity and financing like that. But can we build something with the very best of the knowledge and information technologies available to us now that makes coherent choice making that factors the total collective intelligence and total collective agency with the speed and coherence of what a small number of agents would have, and yet without any kind of centralized power? Well we can say that something like that is part of the criteria set of a third attractor of a desirable civilization that is not catastrophes or dystopias." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ZCOfUYrZJMQ?t=829)

> "I think there is a humongous amount of what we are perceiving about human behavior that is physiologically mediated a lot. And then also mimetically and culturally mediated, and I think the exploration of the full phase space of what could happen to both attenuate the negative contributors and advance all of the different positive contributors, and what the potential of the whole of that space is, is really profound. If we think about things like watching how quickly a technology like social media (like Facebook) can increase people's enmity towards their fellow citizens of the same country - to the point that both sides are oriented towards war - like so rapidly can vitriol and anger and whatever get stirred up as a result of just the media that people are being exposed to - out of the so much stuff what is being concentrated by the AI that's selecting for me. Could that same technology, curating with a different set of purposes, that was bias correcting rather than doubling down on bias, that was helping people connect to much wider networks rather than tribal networks, that was helping to up regulate more synthesizing and nuanced responses rather than other ones, could that affect culture and intelligence and disposition at scale in a way that no religious prophet could have ever dreamed of historically?

> "I hope the attractor of cascading catastrophes or control mechanisms that prevent it, but create dystopias, create a framework for what we want to avoid. And that a third attractor that has the intelligence and regulatory power to avoid the catastrophes while having checks and balances on itself to be non-dystopic, that the creation of a world system that can do that should be the kind of central innovation goal of the world - of which everything is an element or a subsidiary part, and that more total collective intelligence and innovation and motivation being focused on these issues is worthwhile. And I hope that rather than creating a sense of doom or overwhelm, that what this information might create is a sense of almost like a validation of something that has been intuited - an increased sense of clarity that makes the complexity of the challenge space at least start to feel tractable, and because if it is apprehendable, and if there are at least thought experiment-wise possible solutions, then there is a direction of endeavor, and to have more people feel that hopefulness that is not the naive hopefulness of not being aware of all these problems, but the hopefulness that comes on the other side of being aware of all of them and seeing what it would take to move through that, and be oriented to that - that's what I hope becomes of this." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ZCOfUYrZJMQ?t=6214)

> "This is exactly the centre of what I'm focused on: the problem is fundamentally the inability to coordinate between agents where their basis for agency intrinsically has deltas - right - there's a what's best for me in the current system of a private balance sheet and money and those types of things - what's best for me is not what's best for you and best for the commons - even though it would be over the long term, over the short term it doesn't seem to be. And so everyone is doing utility maximization functions but with again, unlike evolution, with asymmetric power relative to the environment and supply-side relative to demand side and things like that, and this then ends up creating a situation where it gets worse - like this is actually a very important point - if I have true information about the nature of reality, that is a source of strategic competitive information so I want to withhold that information (we call this a trade secret or classified or confidential information or intellectual property) but I don't just want to withhold that - I also want to make sure to throw anyone else that would figure it out off the scent trail so I want to do not just withholding of information but disinformation, and we have a situation where everyone is incented to do withholding of true information and signaling of disinformation, and then we have information technology that's exponential information technology where I can do customized disinformation for different persona types and all the way down to individuals - we get to a world where we stop being able to parse signal from noise because there's so much radical disinformation and we have a situation where a coordination actually becomes impossible because of these agency issues everywhere. It's supposed to be the two different intelligence agencies within a country perfectly coordinate with each other to support that country because they're all on team country, right, Team USA against the Russians and the Chinese and whatever, but really those two different intelligence agencies are also competing against each other for a larger percentage of the budget, and then even to different departments within that organization and even to different people competing for the same promotion will withhold information and maybe even disinform, engage in corporate politics - corporate politics is where someone's optimizing their own bonus structure and their fealty relationships at the expense of what's actually good for the whole because they're not actually coupled to the whole effectively - and so you get a situation of fractal defection - everybody defecting on everyone to some degree while signaling that they're not doing that - and this basically means a catastrophic breakdown in the sense making necessary to make good choices while having an exponentially increased amount of choice making power. And if we think about that, exponentially decreasing quality of sense making relative to the overall situation with exponentially increasing choice making power - that's another way to think about inevitable collapse." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=2330)

> "So why do we get so much concentration of sociopathy in the top of fortune 500 companies and politics and then especially things like finance? Well because they're basically systems to attract, reward, incentivize, and condition sociopathy, because to get to the top the power game it's going to be people who are attracted to power and people who are good at winning a bunch of win-lose games, because at each step they move up the ladder they're winning against somebody else - usually via involving things like disinformation and defection and whatever it is - and so if you think about the nature of what a government or a corporation or any top-down power system are - it is basically a strange attractor for people who want to have power over, for people who are running power dynamics, and this is why, you know, let's try and say that I have a benevolent dictator - well there's a reason that we don't get sustainable benevolent dictators is because let's say I have a benevolent dictator - and we can get this in a corporation from great founder Theory sometimes, because if the founder holds the you know, majority of stock or whatever, but it never out lives them, and usually they end up getting kicked out. So let's say I have a benevolent dictator. All the people who are one step under them are doing things that they require to be able to stay as a dictator because it's pretty easy to kill somebody or to oust them or whatever, so if I'm at the top of a top-down power system I have to keep everybody under me preferring me to be above them rather than overthrow me, which means that rather than do what's best for everybody I have to do what's best largely for those who are right near me, and they have to do that for those who are under them, and that ensures a kind of power law distribution of power and again there's like a multipolar trap on corruption - if anyone's willing to do a really fucked up thing to try and overthrow me, I have to be able to play at the game of fucked up things or I get overthrown. So we can see how top-down power systems are going to both attract, condition, reward, incentivize things like sociopathy and so then we end up having a world run by sociopaths which is not a good thing for anybody. But now let's think about something like a tribe - and I'm not gonna over romanticize here, I'm just kind of thinking through the dynamics in a first principles way - if I've got 40, 50, 70, up to a Dunbar number of people living in a tribe there's an extraordinarily high degree of transparency that is forced in that scenario - everybody pretty much sees everything that's going on with everybody and everybody knows everyone, everyone has fealty relationships with everybody in the tribe. So sociopathy is not gonna be advantageous - you're not going to have an evolutionary niche in that environment for much in the way of conspiring and lying, because it will get found out and it will get punished, and so the forced transparency creates an accounting system where you don't get an evolutionary niche for somebody fucking the other people in the system. And so as soon as the system starts to get large enough that 1) there's anonymous people so I can harm people who I don't really know and care about as opposed to everybody who is in the system as somebody that I know and care about, and 2) I can do stuff that people won't be able to see I can kind of have a corruption of the accounting in the system - now we get an evolutionary niche for rather than participating with the system - doing internal defection. I'm not externally defecting and leaving the system - I'm internally defecting and playing the system. And that's what most everyone inside of a corporation or a government is optimizing - what is good for them and their direct fealty relationships rather than what's good for the whole, and nobody can tell. And this is a particularly hard scenario, but the reason I'm saying this is because we do our social science inside of a world where these systems have become ubiquitous, and then we assume that those properties where there's ubiquitous conditioning, are intrinsic to human nature and I think we have to be very careful about that - I think a lot of them are not intrinsic to human nature - they are a result of the ubiquitous conditioning and we could create conditioning environments in which things like sociopathy are just not advantageous and so they don't get up regulated." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=3104)

And all the things that I can buy are produced by someone where not only do they have limited IP but they also have whatever designed obsolescence and desire for proprietary stuff so you use the rest of their ecosystem stuff so it's not interoperable - I have to deal with that shitty suboptimality even from the richest guy in the world." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=4122)

> "What could provide increased capacity that can't be weaponized? That's a very interesting question. We could say that every technology that increases capacity can be weaponized - meaning: can be used by some agent to increase their capacity relative to other agents or the commons. Except if we had a social technology that was anti rivalrous, but it actually produced increased coordination capacity - you actually can't weaponize it because it is the solvent for weapon ization itself. It is actually the basis of how agents interact in a way that doesn't incentivize weapons and so for anyone to instantiate that thing they are actually changing the nature of their agency. So in the current system, again, private balance sheet, I'm in a big corporation, I'm gonna do the thing that optimizes my bonus structure and my status in the company - even if it fucks other people in the company and the company as a whole and that might include spreading disinformation, withholding information, etc. Well let's say I could create a situation where I couldn't get ahead of the expense of the whole so I had both the right kind of transparency and accounting systems and access to Commonwealth resources where only as the Commonwealth does better do I do better and things like that. Then we can have a situation where no one... Let's just say if we could invent a situation in which no one had an actual incentive to spread disinformation or to hoard information, if they shared true information - maybe they'd be wrong but they at least had the incentive for full earnestness and full transparency - if you had a situation where that was the incentive - you figured out how to do that - and I will say there is a way to do that, I believe there's a way to do that - then you would get a situation where you had an information ecology that was actually intact at a larger scale. That would lead to radically better capacity to coordinate and innovate - better sensemaking than the current system has - in that system as a whole would be more effective at producing all of the metrics that matter relative to total resource per capita than any current system would be. And I only need a small number of people - relatively small number of people - who get that and want to instantiate it as a new full stack civilization to create a new strange attractor or a new attractor basin, where anyone else looking at it says 'Well quality of life is higher on every metric there and they're also able to innovate us on a bunch of things, they're figuring out solutions to that we don't have, well then why don't we just kill them? Well because they aren't trying to win the game of power against us, they aren't building militaries or signaling or narrative warfare to try and beat us, and actually they're exporting solutions to us that we need to the rest of the world, because if they have increased capacity to innovate and solve problems, because they can actually coordinate better, because they don't have disinformation information withholding' - then they can look at what groups that would otherwise have enmity with them actually need - develop those solutions and create dependents rather than enmity relationships while simultaneously saying 'If you want to know how to do this as well, we've actually open sourced it - it's a social technology, you're welcome to use the social technology' - but the social technology will fundamentally change your basis for agency if you employ it. So obviously there's a million things we would need to dig into there, but just the thought experiment goes: fast adopters build a new ground-up system where the new ground-up system becomes a new attractive basin and - you know - that's a way of thinking about that I don't try and... If I have to shift at the level of axioms I can't retrofit current system - I have to build something, but if the thing that I build is fundamentally more attractive ground up, then I only need fast adopters to understand it in concept to have medium adopters understand that after seeing its implementation." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/9psdN65IzOw?t=4517)

> "Whenever something becomes the legitimate authority on truth for a topic it's extraordinarily powerful because what everyone else thinks is real, which is the basis of how they're going to behave, is actually like at the bottom of the stack of power. And so even if a legitimate authority emerges rightly - because it's actually earnest and doing better empiricism and whatever - as soon as it starts to get that power there will be maximum incentive for all of the power players to try to corrupt it and influence it in various ways, which they usually can because which science is going to get funded is going to be based on someone who has funds putting money into something that will continue to support or advance them having funds. And so even if, say, a piece of science is technically accurate - it's not wrong - it might be that only certain topics within a domain that have ROI more associated get funded - other ones don't, like for instance you know, patentable small molecules and pharma compared to peptides or biologics or plant-based things. And so then the preponderance of research doesn't actually map to the overall space well, so even things that are true can still be misrepresentative or misleading - so this problem that legitimate authority within an economic game theoretic environment will always get captured or influenced to various degrees and so how do we address that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=1890)

> "We need to have governance - I'm going to separate governance as a process and government as an established top-down enforcement of rule of law with monopoly of violence. We need to have governance at the level that we're having effects - meaning we have to be able to actually make sense of the effects we're having and factor that into the choices that we're making, and when we have planetary effects on the atmosphere and the ocean and etc. but we don't have planetary governance, then we just get multipolar traps where okay, we don't want to fish all the fish out but if we can't make an agreement that China or somebody else is going to also follow and they're going to get ahead economically and the ocean's still going to get ruined then they're going to use that economic benefit to damage us - not only will we not make an agreement to manage the commons - we actually have to race to fish all the fish out faster than they do, or make AI weapons faster than they do, or whatever else it is that's exploitive. And so not having global governance when we're having global effect leads to catastrophe, but having global government of the types that have only ever become corrupted and then as a result broke down also leads to catastrophe. And so we need something that is different than either of those things that have been imagined so far." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2035)

> "Very few civilizations since the beginning of civilization until now have been republics or democracies - they've almost all been feudalistic or autocratic of some kind and that actually makes sense, because one guy ruling everything or some very small number of people that can talk, coming up with a consensus, and then being able to rule is way easier than getting a huge number of people - mostly who are anonymous to each other - to all actually be able to make sense of the world and coordinate. Like a large number of people coordinating is actually a very expensive tricky thing, and from the way I see it, throughout history the few times democracies emerged - they emerged following cultural enlightenments that had a few things in common. When we look at the Athenian democracy coming out of the Greek enlightenment: stoicism plus the Aristotelian school and - you know - a few things had caught on to the place where they had a cultural value around education, that everyone would learn formal logic and everyone would learn rhetoric and history and - you know - those types of things, plus the kind of stoic culture where they're all learning emotional regulation and the socratic method where they're learning how to take each other's perspectives, debate any side of a conversation. Well if I have a bunch of people who are trained to be able to assess base reality clearly on their own, they have emotional regulation so they are not as susceptible to emotional and cognitive hijacks and groupthink and have the courage to disagree and things like that, and they can take each other's perspective and they're actively seeking to - well those are the prerequisites to something like a democratic system being able to emerge because those people can have a good quality conversation about shared sense making, recognize that some compromises to agree are better than warfare with each other and come up with solutions, so collective choice making emerges out of the collective sense making, meaning making and conversation ability. And our country similarly coming out of the post-european renaissance enlightenment phase was - you know - the idea of renaissance men, renaissance people who could have expertise across a lot of topics - not just be specialists - because specialists across different domains have a hard time being able to communicate really effectively towards governance that requires looking at a lot of those things, but the idea that we could become renaissance people, that we could all have empirical capacity, the scientific method, and the hegelian dialectic - that we could hear a view and then seek the antithesis to that thesis and then seek a synthesis - some higher order reconciliation - that again gives rise to the possibility of participatory governance. And you can see when you read the documents and the letters of the founding fathers - and of course there was a lot wrong with the Athenian democracy and a lot wrong with our country that had genocide and slavery as parts of its origin, but the whole world had genocide and slavery as parts of what were going on at the time and it was at least moving in the direction of increasing participatory style governance - the thing that the founding fathers talk about so much is the need for very high quality universal public education and very high quality fourth estate that's independent - or news as the prerequisites of democracy. George Washington said - I'm not going to quote exactly - it's something to the effect of that the single most important goal of this government should be the comprehensive education of every single citizen in what he called the science of government, and I think the science of government is such an interesting phrase because we've separated science and the humanities so formally, and the science of government would be history and game theory and political theory and the things that people need to know the shenanigans that happen so that they can prevent them, and Franklin said 'If I could have a government without news or news without a government - I would take news' because if the people really know what's going on they can self-organize and overthrow government - if the people don't know what's going on they can only be captured. And our public education or education of any kind here in the kinds of civics that people would need to really understand what's happening in government and understand regulatory capture and be able to bind it obviously is close to non-existent and the news has been mostly captured by economic and political interests, so there is no chance for a bunch of people that identify as being in almost tribal warfare with each other, who aren't sense making reality well, who don't understand governments, who don't really understand markets, who only have pejorative strawmans of each other and don't seek each other's opinion - those people can't do a republic or democracy, so it will simply devolve back to an autocracy which we see happening. And the way I think of it is like: if there's a bodybuilder who has a huge amount of muscle - the moment they stop working out they start losing it, because it's very expensive metabolically to keep that much muscle - they have to kind of keep working at it - it's very expensive to keep an entire population comprehensively educated and actively engaged. And once it seems like the government's working well and a generation passes and the kids didn't go through the pain of the revolutionary war and the grandkids didn't - it becomes very easy to just get engaged in your own stuff and not keep participating in the governance and then you stop having a government of, for, and by the people - and you start having a class of people that do government, and when the people stop checking the state - the state stops being able to check the predatory aspects of the market, which is what it's really intended to do - and then the market ends up capturing it - you get regulatory capture, and then rather than liberal democracy you get a kleptocracy that eventually becomes an autocracy. And that's what I see that we have right now - and so do I trust any particular authority to arbitrate truth or good faith or whatever right now - no. Do I trust a collective intelligence that's actually increasing in its authentic intelligence - I would trust that much more - it's an expensive hard proposition, but I don't see any other good choices." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2335)

> "So partly it has to do with scale - for sure - which is... the founding fathers thing here - there was an idea that everybody could go to the town hall and discuss the issues that were mostly geographically close to them, that everyone could sense base reality on their own, and you could have a small enough number of people in the town hall that for the most part the people who had something to say could actually say something about it. And when we moved to a place of most of the issues are globalized - whether we're talking about finance or supply chains or environmental issues or - you know - geopolitical ones - obviously that's a level of complexity where people can't depend on their own base sense making and they can't process that much information and second and third order effects and confounding effects as well. And one topic I'll just enter here because we haven't discussed it yet is the concept of hyper objects, which is connected to but a little bit distinct from just raw complexity, that we evolved to be able to apprehend and understand objects that were available to our senses, and when I'm talking about something like climate change - I can't see climate change, I can't taste it, I can't hear it - I can only conceptualize it, I can see a drought, I can see a fire - there have always been droughts and fires, but to understand climate change I have to think about some kind of statistics and complex mathematical models on the droughts and the fires. I also can't see world hunger - I can see a hungry person somewhere, but I can't actually directly apprehend - I can only do it conceptually, which also means I don't have the same felt visceral experience of the things, and the same is true with I can't actually directly see or apprehend AI risk or biotech risk or nanotech risk or or the nature of markets, and so we have a world where the most influential things are mostly all not apprehendable to the senses, and so we have not just the issue of can we have a better felt sense or our intuitions are more right, that our kind of sensibility of what's likely true as well as our kind of formal analytic thinking - can we get hyper objects but then can we get the connection of lots and lots of hyper objects - markets interacting with social media environments,  interacting with climate, and things like that - and I think it's just important to kind of state that, to have a sense of how different the problem space of the things that we need to understand and think about are now compared to the evolutionary problem space most people had to think about, and how different the kinds of collective sentence making need to be and choice making need to be, and then I'll also step back and say even in environments where we weren't dealing with as much in the way of complexity and hyper objects - our sense-making was actually usually still adequate to solve local problems in ways that very often caused other problems somewhere else or down the road - and this is an important part of understanding this is like the model that we can look at all of our problems as a result of either conflict theory or mistake theory - conflict theory meaning we know we're going to cause harm somewhere and we're doing it anyways for game theoretic purposes, mistake theory as you were mentioning with Facebook we didn't know this was going to happen and it was simply an unintended externality. So we have to deal with both moving forward - how do we remove the basis of conflict theory so no one is motivated to do things that will knowingly harm something else and how do we also deal with the mistake theory of being able to anticipate externalities and internalize them into the design processes better, and so the mistake theory side - you can go back to - we didn't necessarily know that the development of stone tools would lead to us becoming apex predators that were increasing our predatory capacity faster than the environment could become resilient, that led us starting to extinct species at scale and then become the apex predator in every environment and start the anthroposcene, or you can come to a closer one and say when we were making the internal combustion engine to solve the problem of the difficulty of horse husbandry pulling buggies - we didn't anticipate that in solving the horse husbandry problem that we'd be causing climate change and oil spills and wars over oil and the U.S. petrodollar, and so typically if we're going to make a solution that solves a problem - the solution has to be somehow bigger than the problem, faster, whatever - to be able to scale and overtake it to really solve the problem, but if we define the problem in a narrow way - there's one or two or some small number of metrics - and the solution we're trying to create has a first order effect on a small number of known metrics, but it might have second and third order effects on a very large number of unknown metrics - we can see that the safety analysis is actually harder in kind than the solution analysis and this is something that we actually have to start factoring - I don't just need to understand the problem I'm trying to solve - I have to understand the problem embedding landscape of the adjacent problems and the adjacent topics and the adjacent meaningful things and I have to start thinking through second and third order effects better - whether I'm designing a proposition or designing a piece of technology or designing a company to solve a problem - to say if that solution's effective, what other things is it likely to do and what harms could that cause to complex environments and then how do we actually factor that into the design process." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=2937)

> "Before we discuss a perfected system we can just discuss how to stop some of the most egregious things about the current system. Current system - people are radically certain about things that they have no basis to be certain about and it's actually their false certainty that causes most of the problems - if they simply acknowledge that it was too complex and they didn't know - they at least wouldn't be going to war over dumb stuff, and to so to simply be able to have people be like 'I don't know yet but I'm interested and I'm gonna try to seek to know better' would actually slow the rate of breakdown tremendously." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=3412)

> "Do I think that we can get the hierarchical complexity or the ability of people to process information up? Yes. Even before that - if I can start getting them a memetic immune system to where they aren't just cognitively and emotionally hijacked - right now it's mostly not even 'can they do good epistemology' - it's that they're just captured by narrative warfare - if I can simply get a memetic immune system where people start to notice how [Russell conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation) and [Lakoff framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphorical_framing) happens - yes that scientific article said something, but the news article put spin on it - can they notice how the spin's occurring? Yes that's a true statistic but it's cherry picked - when you look at all the other statistics it doesn't look like that same picture at all. And people start noticing those kind of info and narrative weapons and become inoculated enough that it's not like absolute lowest common denominator collective intelligence - that will make a huge shift, so we have to factor the kind of memetic emotional immunity and cognitive immunity topic, then better epistemology for the individuals and better orientation towards socratic dialogue, hegelian dialectic - like seeking shared understanding because of understanding the need to coordinate being less bad than warfare & not coordinating. Then I think we start to get emergent collective intelligence where more sovereign and intelligent people and better conversations start to produce systems of coordination to bottom-up effect where those systems of coordination produce a top-down effect that continues to incentivize that bottom-up effect better and you get a recursive process between better systems of collective sense making and choice making and better development of individuals and their communication capacity with each other." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/3lil4invvSI?t=3993)

> "When you say casually "I don't know what I'm seeing" - you don't mean that there are no words in your head to describe it, you mean you literally can't make sense of what you're seeing. So sense making goes beyond words - it goes to like things like pattern recognition, it goes to a literal gut feeling of confusion or clarity, and so on. These are very basic human experiences and the scaling of these basic human experiences is what helps you produce a dynamic coherence to society. So a society that has sense making does not need to just you know follow the leader's gut feeling - it in fact has something of a shared correctly constructed gut feeling versus one that is to a significant extent very chaotic, oppositional, no premise is followed up by a conclusion, no incorrect premise is ever disproven, you say A on monday - B on tuesday, A is more viral, the virality is rewarded - not the correctness. That's the problem. If you wish to have a somewhat free society the sense making has to be participatory, which means that different levels of society can correct each other, different centers of society can correct each other, and they're even able to find this like commonality of speech and so on. Then there's the question of meaning - how do we evaluate things, do we find meaning in them or do we not find meaning in them, what is motivating us even? The sense of enemy often comes with not just a loss of sense making - there are many people in fact who have fairly coherent world views, they even share these worldviews with others but they're fundamentally depressed, and one of the reasons they're often fundamentally depressed is because of the question "So what?" - you said how it is, tell me how it should be. Or rather "I know how it is but I don't know how it should be". And then finally there's the question of choice making and how are decisions between different possible futures made - again both for individuals and society as a whole. The sort of simple solution is that you have a single center that tries to make decisions. The other alternative is sort of anarchy - there are no real decisions made anywhere, and the ideal coherence is that society builds these decisions together through something like a discourse, something like a deliberative process, where deliberative doesn't just merely mean voting - it goes much beyond voting - it is the shared building of the model of the world and the "what about it" & "so what do we do about it" and finally the details of the implementation." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/bHCg8bhtbqs?t=1530)

> "What we did on economics is we took the tiniest slice of human behavior - self-interest - and then we wrapped it with abstract mathematics in the late 1800s. Big chunks of our economic theory has been there ever since. This theory of the self-interested individual wrapped in mathematics is built from the sanctity of the person and personhood and it's kind of all set up to guarantee market equilibrium. It's also over the course of the last hundred+ years a theory that has largely been walled off from other disciplines while growing in influence and in stature and Academia, infecting public policy, business administration, infecting the other social sciences, and even in more recent years affecting the Natural Sciences. When its assumptions are challenged, or when the theory of the rational actor - the self-interested individual - doesn't hold up against other theories or other disciplines, or when the scientific method gets in the way, economists have this very convenient line "it's just a model", or they often quote George box - the statistician - "All models are wrong, some are useful". I would add one little piece to that: "All models are wrong, some are useful" - I agree - "Useful for whom?" - and that's the big question that we need to ask today." - [Jon David Erickson](https://youtu.be/EC11UQD9q3w?t=369)

> "Following the example of autoimmune diseases, the main cause of warfare is a misidentification, i.e. perceiving a fellow cell within humanity as the Other. Although the actors of war are political organizations (following Levy & Thompson’s definition of war), individuals are the ones who do the actual fighting to advance the interests of the leadership of a particular political organization. In the case of warfare, the interest of the leadership and the fighting individuals rarely correlate. Consequently, the political elite must convince the public that liquidating fellow cells within the collective body is the only option left to resolve an ongoing conflict. Here ideology plays the most crucial role. State ideology is disseminated to the people via various propaganda organs. The false framework of “us vs. them” is established by magnifying the differences between human beings (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political opinion, membership of a particular social group etc.) while willfully ignoring the fact that we are equally important and valuable cells within humanity. Divide et impera (“divide and conquer”) is an ancient Latin maxim that was widely used in every historical era. In the twentieth and twenty-first century we witnessed narratives based on binary opposites such as Aryan vs. Jew (World War II), communist vs. capitalist (Cold War) and terrorist vs. peace-loving citizen (War on Terror). Creating an image of the enemy (the Other) and instilling fear in the public are classic examples of the propaganda machine specifically designed to manufacture an ideology based on division." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "The healthy state of humanity is peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Although the increasing destructiveness of military technology reduced the incentives of major powers to fight large-scale wars, we still see significant amount of warfare in the world. These developments suggest that the general quality of consciousness of humanity is rather low. Identifying a fellow cell as an enemy because it lives in another organ (cf. nationality), looks like a red blood cell instead of a white one (cf. race), believes in the heart instead of the brain (cf. religion), and follows the kidney instead of the gall bladder (cf. political affiliation), is not the characteristic of an efficient, well-organized, low-entropy system. I suggest that the top-down approach toward peaceful coexistence does not work as the failure of the Kellogg-Briand pact (1928) demonstrated. The potentially more effective bottom-up design (eradicating ignorance one person at a time by identifying the Other as an equal unit within the collective body) may lead to a quantum leap in the consciousness of humanity that will result in – among others – the total absence of warfare based on the realization of our interconnectedness and essential oneness. The reason why the so-called Golden Rule of every major world religion stipulates to treat others the way we would like to be treated is because every individuated unit is part of the whole (i.e. humanity, and ultimately, the Self). Given that the Self (the Absolute that is commonly referred to as Tao in Taoism, Brahman in Hinduism, God in Christianity, Yahweh in Judaism and Allah in Islam) consists of everything and everybody (the four elements, the mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom and the human kingdom), harming the Other is literally harming the Self – myself. The only possible explanation behind damaging the Other is the lack of recognition that there is no Other: everything and everybody is part of the Self." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "Immense financial, natural and human resources are directed at warfare, even though one trivial realization on a mass scale would result in the total cessation of all hostilities. This realization is that every Other (the so-called “enemy”) is in actuality a fellow cell, because regardless of the superficial differences these very units comprise the living organism we call humanity. The healthy, peaceful, cooperative state of humanity needs to be every responsible human being’s concern." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

Cultural evolution is the continuation of biological evolution

democracy is like an economic market where you can only buy your products once every few years and many different aspects are clumped into representatives from only a few suppliers (2 in the US). If economic markets worked like that they wouldn't be creative or efficient

vertical markets are a disaggregation of democracy - enabling evolvability of governance solutions through fine-grained competition and trial & error

If a vertical market exists, an externality is like an unmet personal need in an economic market - a profit opportunity for any enterpreneur who wants to develop an element of governance that corrects that externality in a cooperative fashion

Governance and democracy need to be unbundled - their current forms (electing representatives every few years) were conceived centuries ago because we simply couldn't have done it better back then - we need to reinvent them in the digital era.


Global consciousness can be thought of just like ours: thousands of competing signals for our conscious attention (our global workspace) coming from all directions - most of which are filtered out - surfacing only the most pressing ones. We need to develop a hierarchical system that surfaces the most important signals and information.

If its good enough for nature, it is good enough for us. We are part of nature.

Our goal should be to come up with the best and most important education for every human and then figure out how to diffuse the gradient between the least and best educated people. Nature is intolerant of gradients (temperature, pressure, electrical charge) and neither should our culture when it comes to education. We should strive towards educational equilibrium - even though it is inherently unattainable.

Seeing that other species matured out of a youthful competitive phase into a mature cooperative phase means everything to us now. The Darwinian story only goes to the adolescent part where there's hostile competition. You take all you can get. You fight your enemy. You try to out-do him or try to bump him off and that's what makes you survive. But that's not what sustainability is all about. Sustainability happens when species learn to feed each other instead of fight each other. You get mature ecosystems such as rainforests and prairies where you have far more cooperation than you have hostile competition. You can still have friendly competition, but that's very different.

What if we could collectively agree on offchvain cbdc protocols and could collectively vote what should happen to them?

We can crowdsource and agree upon what the most fundamental concept of our civilisation should be, and why, and enforce it within there
Cooperation and education and the scientific method

Just like the CCP crafts policy papers which are then handed down to executive branches, we should crowdsource our civilisational policies and reward companies that implement them with higher ranking

We can crowdsource how the world should work and walk backwards from that until it becomes applicable to us currently

The meaning economy - how power, attention and incentives work in the global brain

Civilizational KPIs

Planning ahead for a debt jubilee

Anything that needs improvement in this new information economy will be collectively incentivised through reputation and pagerank

We should orient our lives towards building reputation that can be taken away from us by collective consensus - aligning our incentives.


PageRank 2.0

We can design the incentive system for participating in constructing the worldview that should be taught to everyone

Not living your best self is hurting the whole

We can sort the expertise of any vertical and then use the best

We need to crowdsource a new manager (as from john’s work) for the next step of our civilisation

Imagine the multidimentional oscars where any overlapping subset of people can vote differently - and all that in public. What different cohorts think, and what the cohort with the highest predictive capacity and competence and achievement ranks highest.


What if it becomes a competitive advantage for companies to allow their employees to export and prove their competence from their work there? Opening the gates for those that want to work in public and transparently


This is the real neuralink - the real way we link our minds

We should crowdsource the best possible guide to being a human

Reinventing governance

Cooperation is the ultimate intentionally evolutional goal

Write about wealth distribution and accumulation and how we should think about it

We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point
^^ this should be in the roadmap as a strategy

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

!!!! The great reset: !!!!
We should incentivise participating transparently in public and make that the only way of climbing the social ladder - a complete flattening of the power distribution - this is the great reset

The current elites would have to start earning reputation from ground up on the new rules

Hierarchy is a core tenet in computer science

Headjack offers a few distinct data availability setups - fully decentralized or proxy-mediated

the god of the 21st century has to be cooperation, backed by the scientific method and evolutionary theory


we use symbols and categories in our minds and there's a single representation for any concept/entity/event - we should do the same for the global brain

hyperindividualism will be our doom

we need a holistic view of the inerconnectedness of our civilization

The blank slate participatory redesign of our civilization

at the core of intelligence is the capacity for relevance realization - according to john vervaeke
relevance realization is self-organizing

the better we causally map reality, the better we'd navigate and realize what is relevant

Debasing the substrate upon which we depend

Our technical capability is growing exponentially while our capacity to make sense of the exponentially increasing complexity of the world is diminishing - this runs off a cliff
our information ecology is increasingly more broken
https://youtu.be/nQRzxEobWco?t=247


We need to let ideas have sex as Matt Ridley put it.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLHh9E5ilZ4

imagine being able to subscribe to better metaphors for concepts you care about - metaphors that better get those ideas across to others. "Let me know when a more effective way of communicating this idea comes up"

we should be thinking in terms of sensory & motor systems - OODA loop

rewarding whistleblowing

the absence of reciprocity shouldn't pay - free riding should be abolished

In biology, within an organism, different organs or cells don't try to hide information from others - there is absolute transparency - even if signals don't traverse from end to end (most of the times it doesn't make sense)

A parallel reputational sensemaking network

Participatory social engineering

we could give points for "filling your profile" - values, top 10s, etc.


Balaji:
This, again, is quite different from current “social” networks like Twitter, which give individual scores for likes and followers but no team dashboard, no way of setting and achieving tangible goals as a group.

we need a power structure that is inherently trusted and legitimized by competency, accountability, transparency, and participation.

Global Brain Specialists are the future of consulting.

According to an ideal internet bill of rights, today's social media giants would be in violation as we can't freely associate and assemble - we don't truly own our data and there's no such thing as permissionless innovation.

Eventually, the network will become more powerful than both god and state.

augmenting markets, economics & finance with reputation and status

booting up the reputation/accountability/status market

Identity is something stable others can point to

extending capitalism to social capital

We are all complicit in ignorance

Inversion of control

Coherence funnel == concept/entity/event deduplication

We need to rethink most foundations of our civilization

concern: permanent record

Gamifying information processing

We can define the fitness landscape

Ignorance is an externality

We can incentivize specific affiliation and accreditation - nudging human resources


Mention the carbon pulse

Insight and progress happen at the edge of chaos - where we operate with concrete structure and ideas but inject randomness and allow for new kinds of pattern matching and mix and matching

All this is about the god paragraph

This is the social protocol
Cooperation, transparency, immutability
God

This is what self actualization is

This is the god that defeats moloch

To be in service of/to others

There >>>IS<<< an objective reality about any of our problems and we need to strive to get closer to it in our models of understanding

John Vervake’s legacy will be the contribution of relevance realization as a mental frame

We can gamify alignment

We can literally find ourselves in the situation of the movie dont look up

We can have a means to accurately assess the quality of the leaders we choose

Blockchain is the alignment technology that supersedes the old paradigm of nation states and markets with their current flaws 

“Use it or lose it” - we haven't even had a global brain to begin with (the closest we have is markets but they're unconscious) - imagine what we could achieve as a civilization

This idea is worth worshiping tm

Virtue’s most literal manifestation is cooperation

The alignment problem is 99% about human alignment

This project is how we build god and become him

The network is more powerful than the state

The full historical record of our work on the tree-like branching relevance realization requires immutable addressibility and permissionless access by anyone - at scale (no limits)

We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?

To be a philosopher is partially to work on relevance realization, just like fundamental physics, or biology

John Vervaeke will be remembered for elevating relevance realization as a fundamental concept or goal

This architecture enables the construction of the global consciousness - the global spotlight of most deserving attention - the global workspace theory - the global model of awareness

Taming human nature collectively

Write about the evolutionary adaptability of religions
“Turn the other cheek” - this is an attempt to tame human nature, to reduce conflict and to be moral to others.

Ego death is when you look at the world without the distortion of your own ego and seeing all the love - that is when you’re close to god - the desire to cooperate with everyone

Ego death is the transcendence above our nature - the leap towards the unification and alignment of the smartest and most conscious creature on earth

What if we could harness the will to power in the attempt of becoming god by 
"harnessing the will to power"

What if we could incentivize ambition the right way?
Aligning ambition within humanity

The purpose of life is relevance realization
The purpose of art is to point the way

What if we could choose cooperation as our god? And implemented incentives around identity such that the better and more you cooperate with others and contribute to society, the higher your status gets - closer to becoming god himsef?

What if god is the striving towards relevance realization in evolutionary terms?

What if the answer is relevance realization?

Give a list about what our civilization ought to do next - even immediately - to the best of your ability to forecast

We can vote our own version of the WEF - the one where we decide what to value

Labelers… adjudication

We need to strive for the most optimal relevance realization
Picture the god machine and how the root has the most impact in where the whip goes

Division of labor for the moderation and proper tagging with an incentive reputation for the exchange of time

We need to give the best possible education to everyone in the world - especially the disadvantaged

We need to change how we give status

We can make contributing a status thing

We can have a vote on how to rank votes for any type of other voting - effectively how do we give different kinds of status and how much do we value it

We can vote on the type of cbdc we would want

This is the booting of a network state where status is computable over track record and accountability and competence

The first and forever biggest network state that engulfs the rest will be the meta global governance layer based on transparency, accountability and competence

This is the idea market

Relevance realization is the square root of the meaning of life

The concern with global government is that it could cement the status quo of broken incentives

42 is relevance realization

Why do threadboys exist?

What comes after the state?

For some people the state is their god - how would the global government that younwould vote for be architected? This is the question we could collectively answer and reach alignment of humanity

The people dont want the current power structures to be cemented and because of the fear of the slippery slope to tyranny we reject globalisation

AGI is recursive relevance realization that has fully aligned everyone
The AGI moment is when we start cooperating

Think about what instagram, facebook and threads are.

We need a market for transparency and accountability. On the record

















how do we optimize society?
how do we make sure capital and human labor is allocated better?

Feed the same thing multiple times for greater weight - AI alignment

A voluntary information modulation network

A prerequisite for all of us to be on the same page and achieve coherence is to deduplicate all pages - i.e. concepts, entities, and events.
We need to answer every question just once and in the best possible way - so that we can easily point to it anytime it comes up. Coherence.

What if we could tag the response of someone as open-minded and willing to change their mind when confronted with facts - aka genuinely seeking truth? We need to reward good faith communication

The evolutionary octagon
An opt-in panopticon

we need to augment capitalism with values and accountability

The fairness protocol as god
The god protocol is about fairness and consent

We are incapable of collectively paying attention to what matters - who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience?


Why no structured data and instead all text in Social media 1.0? Because we always port what is familiar to new mediums - like newspapers in the early days of the web.

Concern: reflexivity: using reputation to influence outcomes and gain further reputation due to “proper” prediction

Currently, Wikipedia contributors get no status for their work beyond within their in-group - no wonder that so many people were skeptical it would ever work in the beginning. But what if they could earn computable and provable status that could be exported outside?

scaling labeling through progressive hierarchical escalation & fixing incentives

status for page rank could have decay


What if having worked for a company that got penalized also penalized your reputation - tainting?

Starting with banning pizzerias to burn coal is the most retarded thing we could be doing compared to a carbon tax or fixing our values and status as a society.

We need to direct our efforts towards the real economy - we could anonymously vote for what we want

So many people have critiqued utilitarianism but when I go to the criticism section of Wikipedia’s page for it ai see a tiny amount - not interwoven with identity and queryable.

Imagine being able to run any kind of poll for the people in the shared group - with different privacy settings - different types of voting for within groups and even worldwide polls

what if we could penalize someone for re-uploading a clip instead of linking to the part of the original without losing the context?

Recursive relevance realization
For everything

It is fundamentally an education crisis

Why don’t we derive everything from “most people are good?”

We are constantly amplifying the wrong things - how can we point to the important stuff?

The better we map out the economy, the better we’d be able to run provable simulations - digital twins of the economy

What if you got points for passing different tests for competence and training

What if we could give an account boost for anyone with a job? And so people who choose not to work currently might decide to work a bit for more status - boosting their overall number/score?
What if we gave more status to billionaires if they donated 10% (or 20?) of their wealth?
TODO: how could this backfire? they could essentially buy attentional influence with their money and make more money... Perhaps reputation should decay?
Capitalism leads to wealth concentration, (inflationary fiat money does too) but is the best form of aligning incentives and promoting risk-taking and hard work.
We can augment it (+ markets) by redefining status and incentivizing generosity.
Donations shouldn't be compelled and shouldn't simply go to the ever-hungry and unaccountable/inefficient/corrupt Uncle Sam in the form of a tax ("tax the rich!!! pay your fair share!!!") - anyone should be free to direct their donation however they choose.
Owning an excessive/lavish 250M$ penthouse might subtract some of your reputation

we can even give more weight to recent successful predictions and discount the earliest ones - when someone was still learning to think probabilistically and knew little about the world

Join the opt-in cooperative synapse society of the global brain - it comes with perks!

what if the fabric of society was defined by a layered web of reputation models - an ever-evolving complex incentive structure derived from our values?

AGI vs human alignment
https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1673478260330729472?s=46

Most people have read at leats a couple of books in their life. What if we could socially nudge ourselves into coherence for what is most important and point to the most important books?

== You will own nothing, and be happy
Few people could predict uber and airbnb - most were extremely sceptical. The same will be true for the sharing economy

The further away from iron curtains - the better

fact-checking billions of people doesn't scale. incentivizing the correct labeling/tagging of assertions and fact-checking assertions only once scales.

https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1673622294227308546?s=46
What if we could reward the switching of beliefs in such a way as to incentivize early adopters of better ideas?

What if we could allow the greatest minds, scientists & game theorists to compete and engineer the best models for ranking humans based on their public contributions? Rewarding competency, predictive power, and adaptability (changing their minds when they're initially wrong). This can be the greatest game of all time - scoring high in the ever-evolving global ranking - where even anonymous accounts can participate. Enders game?

We can crowdsource the best legend of "how to participate and what you need to know in order to be good - statistical/bayesian thinking, etc." by checking what the highest-ranking members have suggested - like the "subreddit rules" that moderators define.

google reviews !!! - a reputation system

Non-uniform collectivism

> Evolutionary speaking, a worldview is a strategy for collective survival. That is, it is a blueprint for a stable society, in much the same way that a genome is a blueprint for a stable organism, and a strategy for individual survival. Cognitively speaking, a worldview is a “sense-making lens,” because its function is to make sense of a complicated and confusing reality. As knowledge systems, worldviews aim to reduce our uncertainty about the world in an attempt to minimize anxiety and cognitive dissonance. Simply stated, they tell us what to do and why.

> "The universe no longer appears to just be this big random machine evolving arbitrarily, but instead a creative system that is recursively generating novelty, pattern, and experience—perhaps endlessly. In other words, reality is an emergence generator. So far, it has produced matter, life, mind, and culture through a process of hierarchical self-organization, whereby nature’s fundamental components come together to form greater wholes, which then become the building blocks for the next level of complexity. Subatomic particles came together to form atoms, which came together to form molecules, which formed cells, which formed complex organisms, which formed societies, and human civilization now seems to be forming what has been described as a “global brain.” Could this global brain of humans informationally connected by wireless devices someday become conscious? We can only speculate about what kind of emergences are in store for our civilization should we collectively choose to consciously participate in the process of cosmic evolution that life seems to be such a crucial part of.
>
> Although this paradigm is completely naturalistic, many will find its philosophical implications to have a spiritual quality because they suggest that life has cosmic significance. By “cosmic significance,” I mean that life is a mechanism for the growth of complexity in nature that will shape the evolutionary trajectory of the universe and determine its large-scale development. And if biologically-based intelligence is the primary driver of cosmic evolution, then life has objective significance and a somewhat mysterious purpose that transcends the individual.
>
> If this emerging paradigm—which can be called the paradigm of emergence—suggests that life does in fact have cosmic significance and is not destined for transience, then that is a discovery that must be shouted from the rooftops. One could argue that it is a more profound paradigm shift than those associated with Newton and Darwin, because it places life at the center of everything, though It is actually an extension of the Darwinian paradigm, as it applies evolutionary logic to every scale of organization in nature, including the cosmos as a single system.
>
> Not only would delivering this information have positive effects on the mental health of all the science-minded people who have accepted a nihilistic philosophy for no good reason, it would also be of great practical importance to society, because the new cosmic narrative illuminates not just why we are here, but where we’re going and how to get there. Simply stated, the paradigm of emergence provides a road map for human progress. It is also a general theory of adaptive systems that can instruct us on how to optimize our social, political, and economic systems for maximum resilience and computational power." - [The Paradigm of Emergence: A Unifying Worldview for a Divided World and a Solution to the Meaning Crisis](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/the-paradigm-of-emergence-a-unifying#:~:text=The%20universe%20no,and%20computational%20power.)

While this perspective has undeniably fostered significant advances in our understanding of the natural world, it has also contributed to a fragmented and disconnected view of reality that implies that life is accidental and meaningless. In recent decades, the nihilism of postmodernism has added another layer of complexity and confusion to the scientific discourse, casting doubt on the very foundations of knowledge and truth. As we grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, a new scientific and philosophical paradigm is urgently needed—one that transcends the limitations of both reductionism and postmodernism, while retaining their contributions to our understanding of the world." - [Poetic Meta-Naturalism: A New Philosophy of Reality for the Metamodern Age](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/poetic-meta-naturalism-a-new-philosophy#:~:text=The%20scientific%20landscape,of%20the%20world.)

Self assembly! There isnt the number 5 in our genome about the number of fingers

We can use reputation and incentives to solve collective action problems - the system is flexible enough to design any type of incentive

We get more of what we reward

Earning status in public in the status machine

Define arbitrary status models - different pagerank algorithms for identities, concepts & events!
the results of one page ranking model can be fed into another - layering/wiring complex models
Google's page rank algorithm simply counts the number of inbound links to a page. It's surely evolved to include other heuristics and some notion of reputation, but pales in comparison to the ranking flexibility and power of an open-ended system built around identity and reputation.

We organize our view with tags and lists and let others see our prism - this way the prisms will converge

Relevance filters

what if we could vote on a captain of the attention ship? someone who aims to illuminate the biggest problems - speaking truth to power

what if the brightest minds in game theory, mathematics and statistics could tune society in public?

We put so much effort in trying to optimise attention with the goal of extracting statistical correlations and patterns and yet we do such a bad job at directing the attention of society
The great misallocation of attention

Picture humanity in the most realistic way possible

Any type of specific interaction will have a bunch of app names associated with it

A new relationship with information

How do we make scientists rich and famous?

This idea will also force the reimplementation of something like patreon

Imagine all the youth competing to surface the most truth to the world in the global transparency game

Imagine if instead of having to read a book like “the real antony fauci” all you had to do was look at the computed score of anthony fauci based on criteria you trust

A network for transparency

With canonical deduplicated entries for concepts and events, reality will be harder to ignore

ranking the top concerns of humanity is like becoming aware of our discomfort - a problem well stated is half solved

a permissionless and open-ended event ecosystem around identity is a prerequisite for the global brain

human progress happens when we increase our ability to ask questions

imagine talking with the aggregate sentiment and knowledge of the world with the help of an LLM and exploring humanity in real time through any lens you wish - not with some pre-trained model without a clue how the sausage was made

getting structured data formats wrong isn't fatal - we can always translate old data to newer and more expressive formats. Evolvability.

The fundamental issue of attention

imagine crowdsourcing a movie about the future we want based on our current collective values - as a snapshot in time, and redoing it once every 5 years as things progress

The ability to pattern-match any type of event

How do we make the important actually important, even if it is boring

We can have templates for concepts - how to represent them - what types of functionality layout we should want about a specific thing from the real world - what lens to use when regarding a specific type of concept/event
POSITIONAL SCARCITY !!!
crowdsourced relevance realization !!!

Make accountability liquid

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar

“Be good to others” is the r basis for any religion in regards to morals for within the tribe - we can crowdsource the transparency machine for any organization

“This is what is most important for X” - but for anything

The purpose of life is to leave something after yourself and contribute - to be of service to others

A competence market

We can crowdsource our culture - this is the collectively chosen weights

How do we solve humanity’s biggest problem: how to coordinate better in order to have the best possible future


The metaverse is an mmorpg knowledge graph

futarchy - high dimensional?

we need to change our concept of prestige

How do we ender’s game the global brain and gamify it so participating is interesting?

computable identity: how many times have you shared a news story that contains deepfakes (determined later)?

social learning in regards to the complexity of ontologies and working with knowledge graphs and structured data - since it's all one big social network we'd see how others are using the tools and creating structured data - effectively teaching us how to better express ourselves

The metaverse is the augmentation of the physical with the digital

how to counteract discounting

"synthesis" as project name

better social technologies lower social coordination costs and reduce friction

what if you could define a notification filter for messages/connection requests/etc - anyone with above 10k followers for example

multi-pagerank
poly/multi

social media posts are ephemeral - they're irrelevant beyond the first couple of days (get burried with time) - they're promoted by the recommendation algorithms only for a a small amount of time as there's a constant stream of new events

hit pieces use points selectively (and its hard to gague them of truthfullness) whereas a model calculating a reputation score would take everything into account

radical interconnectedness - glancing at a blog post and being able to see which sections were quoted elsewhere, and being able to filter the "elsewhere" any way you want

generalized scripting!
instead of apps offering niche functionalities you could script and do anything with data!
https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1666102355698364416

The informational multiverse

the next step of encephalization is truly networking our minds - deduplicated identities, concepts & events

we need to upgrade our capacity to learn

A truth market for ideas

Relevance realization: given the near-infinite complexity of the world, how do we intelligibly ignore irrelevant information and zero in on that which is relevant to us?

think of this as collectively writing the guide to/book of life

We need to shift from what are we against to what are we for

It will simply be better and people would shift to it as word goes around

what if we submitted algorithms long a few lines that express more complex things? the collective notebook with interactive code trying to prove stuff?

we could all collectively have a conversation through the distributed aggregate computing of all individuals


TODO: relisten to this episode
Currents 034: Samo Burja on the Consilience Project
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHCg8bhtbqs
talks about carbon credits, media, many good things and ideas I've had

If there are no consequences for wall street playing the “short and distort” game with Tesla for a decade (including the hardest of times for them) - then we should be able to de-amplify topics and entities too. Todo: this point needs more thought

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

what if you want to be able to message someone (they're a contact) but you don't want to follow them on instagram because you're simply not interested in reels and them ending up in your feed and you also don't have a DM channel open with them? its engineered for engagement

we could even split our own vote like 30% from me and the rest 70% split between my delegates for this cause

We need an additional informational signal that is as robust as prices driven by markets and currently media is a failure

write about mycelium

TODO: think about labeling of naughty material and the streisand effect

what if the tags for a creator are automatically updated based on the tags for their individual posts and also ranked by occurance with a histogram?

"Don't look up" but in real life
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/

This is the clearest manifestation of democracy and classical liberalism
careful with the word liberalism - it might not be the right thing here

structured data == AST, where language is the current intermediate representation (IR) and we can upgrade it to structured data
IR built on top of deduplicated concepts, entities and events

“The religion that is not a religion” - stolen from John
Wisdom and meaning famine

evolution is a kind of learning - we need to foster gradual evolvability in every direction
Autodidactic !!!

what if we could short topics? like putting our thumbs on the scales - "show less culture war stuff and surface more important issues"

minimizing ignorance - we need to minimize the error in our models of reality

"complex adaptive systems (CAS) all the way down"

what if we could have citation graphs and ranking for anyone on any topic - not just within the scientific realm?

embracing complexity

anonymity - ZK stuff and dating apps! DATING APPS!

Imagine having your personal jamie to pull things up

fractal debate map

Money on money return

situational awareness - what's the relevant context - being able to view the same thing from different lenses

being wrong should have a cost

We can have competing opt-in committees of experts for health advice

meaning in life comes from connectedness, and especially being connected to something bigger than ourselves

We can crowdsource what is most important and even rank and sort the steps to get to there!!!

complete freedom to experiment in network protocols and self-assembly / self-organization

What if we could develop an opt-in social credit score that we individually determine how it gets calculated? A subjective score

a new choice-making architecture

No Recursively asking “how do we get there? What are the next steps?”

“The recursive subreddit” as a buillding block - a concept

Use a picture of a cockpit with thousands of buttons when talking about social media configurability and the config matrix

A new era of social computing
“Social computing”

We are effectively unconscious

Egalitarianism, meritocracy and a market for ideas

The ultimate currency is time and thus also attention

Error correction scaled

Transparency, accountability, truth and sunlight

We can crowdsource “a guide to life”

We can have campaigns in which we advocate for our values against those of others - in groups, and showing the progress publicly, and how the vote evolves throughout time

Its all just one big high dimensional wikipedia - a multipedia

Write a chapter about a summary of vervaeke’s work and how heafjack as a project overlaps and aids in building the right social system

We can crowdsource what to teach our children - skills, values, technologies
And not just children - even adults. We can collectively guide our attention to what is most meaningful

A philosophical & scientific MMORPG

Meaning in the 21st century - become competent in something, be credible and have the ability to influence stuff - and increase the weight of your vote - a weight thats calculated by consensus

Meaning in the 21st century: aiming for a higher impact if your opinions - earning that weight and have the ability for it to decrease at any point if you do wrong things.
“The reward function” as a chapter

TODO: use high dimensional instead of multi? or not.

Adding dimensionality to thoughts - the ability to filter opinion any way you want

The ability to vote on how votes should be counted in compound model representations

with liquid democracy each person could be a high dimensional representation of their own views

what if we sankey-diagramed every aspect and product of society - from carbon footprint to what transitive connections there are to low-ranking and sociopathic companies and even monetary influence

Negative reputation: carbon footprint, money influence, previous scandals

We can blur our egos together

Bringing liquidity to ideas
A market for any idea

We are unconscious as a species

Whistleblower friendly ecosystem

the most radical experiment in self-organization and emergent order to date

this can replace even phone numbers

instead of upvote/downvote - 5 star ratings on 2 measures: quality and importance

Music… flow… your attention

game b should parasitize game A
game b should be meta-stable

The law of attraction - and attention and focus and how we need to view our attention

> "Why do people want to improve their reputation? Well, our main evolutionary goals in life are survival and reproduction. Having a good reputation is what makes those goals possible — it’s what makes people want to work with you, take care of you, and partner with you.

> But how do status and reputation work? Think about it like this: imagine we all have a number floating above our heads — that's our status score. We can't see it, but we have a sense for where we rank — dating apps even go so far as to quantify it. Over time we learn to perceive both our own score and that of others.
>
> We’re so attune to our status score that we’re laser focused on increasing it even at the expense of seeing objective reality, or truth. As Don Hoffman writes in “The Case Against Reality” “An organism that sees reality as it truly is is never more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality and is just attuned to fitness payoffs” Or as Don says elsewhere: “Optimizing for truth can make you extinct.”
>
> It’s not that we’ll see objective reality (or truth) and consciously ignore it—our brains won’t even filter for it in the first place. In other words, the first thing we see isn’t whether something is true or not, and then decide whether it’s good for us. We do the opposite: We first filter for what’s good for us, and then filter for truth—this explains why we feel emotions first, and then rationalize them after.
>
> To be sure, this doesn’t mean objective reality doesn’t exist. It means we often don’t perceive reality accurately because it’s not aligned with our interest. We think people are rational, but if anything, recent scientific discoveries tell us most of human rationality is not used to make decisions, but rather to come up with arguments to rationalize decisions the subconscious brain has already made." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=Why%20do%20people,has%20already%20made.)

> "What does the prioritization of the status score over objective reality imply? That people who want social status will believe and say whatever is convenient, no matter how crazy. Indeed, it’s more predictive to think of “belief” not as something someone thinks of as true, but as something someone thinks will improve their reputation. Want more evidence people don’t prioritize objective truth? You may have noticed that after centuries of the scientific method, people still believe in things like Astrology.

> And that’s exactly why the precise content of any ideological point doesn't matter. Brains don’t care about ideology. They didn’t evolve to care about abstract concepts. Indeed: Many people are hypocrites with regard to their overt ideological claims if they can get away with it.

>
> This is also why arguments are often useless, and only cause people to dig into their pre-existing positions. All this stuff about steel-manning other arguments to find truth—it may catalyze scientific progress, but in most social circles, it’s also a surefire way to lose friends and alienate people. (Which is why people who do so are heroes, and why communities who encourage it are foundational for progress).
>
> Indeed: Understanding how the outgroup thinks is frowned upon. You’re not supposed to try to understand what’s going on. You’re supposed to not get it and loudly condemn it.

> "So then why do we care so much about politics? What's the point of ideology? Ideology is the water you swim in. It’s a structured database of excuses, used to signal your allegiance or defection to the existing ruling coalition. This is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. Different ideas suit different people at different times. Ideas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas. Which is why the culture war is so existential — because the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit. They don’t really care where they get it; they only care that it’s good.

> So what determines what people say? It seems clear that the default mode of thinking for humans is groupthink, and the content of that groupthink is computed with a complex algorithm taking into account one's peer group, the loyalties one owes and to whom, who has more status and what talking points fit better with the religion that one has been dutifully drilled into since kindergarten." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=So%20then%20why,into%20since%20kindergarten.)

> "There are various ways of interpreting Current Things.
>
> A charitable view is that it’s the wisdom of crowds surfacing the most important problems as well as the best ways of solving those problems. 
>
> A less charitable view is that Current Things are “continuous overlapping sequence of emergencies, awakenings and panics, driven by the same interlocking power centers, demanding ever tighter censorship of speech and thought.”
>
> An even less charitable view is that Current Things, paraphrasing Balaji, are the social equivalents of pump and dumps: They are pump and dumps for clicks for the journalists, votes for the politicians, and dollars for the activists. After all, the business model of the press & social media might as well be to cause the reader as much outrage as possible, every day, to cause fear and panic and drive them to come back tomorrow.
>
> These are all interesting observations — that Current Things involve everyone converging onto the same beliefs and that there are profit motives for increasingly surfacing New Current Things — but they undersell the truthiness of The Current Thing.
>
> Current Things always have elements of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t capture the world’s imagination. If they didn’t contain at least some kernels of truth, they wouldn't resonate. 
>
> That said, there is also often something “off” about The Current Thing as well. If it were so obviously, incontrovertibly accurate, it wouldn’t go viral, since everyone would be convinced already. There’s no need for evangelism when everyone is already converted. What goes viral is often what creates controversy between groups, where people retweet & quote tweet as a way to claim what side they’re on. If they don’t speak up, their tribal loyalty is questioned. Hence the phrase “silence is violence”.

More specifically regarding blindness, people become unwilling to critically analyze the Current Thing if it goes against the belief, precisely because that analysis is a threat to the coherence of the group. When this happens at the group level, this becomes The Madness of Crowds, as opposed to The Wisdom of Crowds, which we usually get when everyone is thinking as a rational individual, not when they are delegating their opinions to the zeitgeist.

And the internet offers the widest camera angle possible—everyone is in the frame 24/7, always at risk of being called out.

> "Here’s the kicker: the crazier a bonding ideology is—the further away it is from objective reality—the more powerful it is in forming tribes. Why? The crazier the idea, or the crazier the way a person defends their idea, the more it proves their loyalty to the group by shutting off their other available options. Your perceived loyalty increases when you make yourself unsuitable for other tribes because it proves you won’t defect and join them. Until you do that, all tribal attachments are fleeting and contingent.

> Consider the phrase, “Abolish the police”, a Current Thing in 2020. Even the people who claimed “Abolish the police” concede that’s not what they truly meant. They meant redirecting police funds to social services and reforming police accountability. But the phrase “Abolish the police” achieves the goal of improving their reputation within their tribe because, by abandoning reasonableness, they are burning the boats to the enemy tribe, demonstrating their in-group loyalty. 
>
> This is also why Abolish the Police was such a textbook Current Thing. “Increased social services for poor people” would have never taken off, nor would “Reform police unions”. People have been trying to get attention to those topics for decades. Only something crazy, but with a kernel of truth, could get such wide attention.

> "Not democratic? How could we not be democratic? Well. Let’s think about it. What does democracy imply? That the people make the decisions. Did you vote for the War in Iraq? For our k-12 system? For our healthcare system? For any of the 3 letter agencies?
>
> The truth is that 99% of government employees are not accountable to a market nor a democratic process. Neither bought by a customer nor picked by a voter. Which is why democracy isn’t a good way of describing what’s actually happening.
>
> And how could it? The reality is that power is always wielded by a tightly organized minority group against a disorganized mess. This is because the masses cannot organize. For a few structural reasons:
>
> First, you can’t get everyone in the room at the same time. Second, they neither have the skills nor interest nor the time to educate themselves on the issues, let alone organize for power. A crowd without organized leadership will simply devolve into a rabble. Think Occupy Wall Street.
>
> In addition to technical reasons, there are psychological reasons. Most people want to be led. They don’t want to figure out every single thing for themselves. They want to outsource the hard decisions and questions to other leaders far more compelling than themselves. And for the people who want to lead, no amount of power is ever enough. People who acquire power always want to consolidate and extend it. As they say, absolute power corrupts absolutely." - [America the Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/america-the-oligarchy#:~:text=Not%20democratic%3F%20How,power%20corrupts%20absolutely.)

> "The present Oligarchy is the fused managerial elites and civil rights state. They reinforce and protect each other. Civil rights is the political story that this oligarchy tells to hold power. Let us rule, and we will smash all oppressive hierarchies. Except our own, of course.
>
> The boards and senior executive teams are just like this too. They will do exactly what is expected of them as members of the oligarchic elite. They have the exact same politics as their peers in that structure. And they all implement the same policies at the same time.
>
> Indeed: We have a theocratic oligarchy wearing the suit of a representative democracy. The oligarchy spans government officials and bureaucrats as well as heads of companies, universities, media properties, foundations, etc. These people care immensely about what their peers at Davos, at Aspen, in the pages of the New York Times, at Harvard, at their dinner parties think. It is very important that they all be in exact alignment at all time." - [America the Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/america-the-oligarchy#:~:text=The%20present%20Oligarchy,at%20all%20time.)

> "As corporations scale, they fear anti-trust, so they depend on the government to let them survive. Governments also depend on companies for tax dollars and support on basic services. The private sector manipulates the public sector via campaign finance and lobbyists, the public sector manipulates the private through regulation and subsidies. 
>
> Burnham, Schumpeter, and others observed that the closer you get to government, the more you see how the government operates in conjunction with any given industry. The field of public choice has a name for this, regulatory capture: where corporations gain so much power in the government that they “capture” their regulator and end up implementing regulations in their industry that have the effect of cementing their market positions in place and preventing new competition. We see this in pharma, housing, healthcare, education, taxi cab industry — nearly every regulated industry.

> Balaji calls this the information supply chain: Stanford does a study which gets published in a peer reviewed journal, like [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) or [Science](https://www.science.org/). That study is then written about in the New York Times and becomes conveyed as truth. Finally, the U.S. Government then enacts some policy based broadly on that original study, claiming their action is based in science. 
>
> This phenomenon is codified deeply into our culture. Take Wikipedia as another example. If you wanted to know where the information came from on a given Wikipedia page, you'd see it came from "[reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)". Who contributes to those "reliable sources"? What exactly is a reliable source? Wikipedia explains in very clear English what a reliable source is. Get ready for it. A reliable source is a source….that’s reliable.

> Is there a mechanism for determining whether the NYT is or isn't a reliable source? Not really. It’s arbitrary. The NYT is grandfathered in.

> "The core function of science is not peer review, publishing in a prestigious journal, or having an academic affiliation. It’s independent replication — the repetition of an experiment such that the variance of that experiment can be better estimated. 
>
> To say that true scientific inquiry is the same as a general appeal to authority is categorically incorrect. The latter may have the form of science, in the sense that it could be laid out like a logically sound argument, but it doesn't have the substance of science, which is based on independent replication. 
>
> And yet, we can’t replicate experiments at the drop of a hat, so we do rely on prestige as a proxy. Because it’s so hard for people to disprove claims, or for us to keep track of who’s been right and who’s been wrong over time, they’re more likely to believe  elite media and universities when they say something is true, no matter how often they’re wrong. 
>
> Despite how wrong epidemiologists are, despite how wrong nutrition science was for decades—food pyramid anyone?—despite the replication crisis which challenges much of psychology—nothing really changes. When elite media and universities say something is true, people will believe it. Furthermore, often people won’t believe a claim until it gets blessed by the experts.
>
> But just because they say something is true, and just because people believe it, doesn’t mean it’s actuallytrue. 
>
> You can see this as the difference between political and technical truths.
>
> Political truths are judged entirely by social consensus — who the president is, whether the dollar has value, or whether the New York Times or Harvard is elite.
>
> But for technology, popularity and truth are not one in the same. Technical truths are things that are true regardless of popularity — the weather, the chemistry of a compound, or the money supply of Bitcoin.

> "The [Iron Law of Oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy) states that all organizations, including those committed to democratic ideals and practices, will inevitably succumb to rule by an elite few (an oligarchy). The theory states that true democracy can't happen mechanically, because a large number of people cannot coordinate or organize. Only small groups can organize. So whenever you have “democracy” or a large number of people who are supposed to coordinate, they simply can’t. So instead a small number of people who can coordinate seize all the power." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=the%20Iron%20Law%20of%20Oligarchy%20states,can%20coordinate%20seize%20all%20the%20power.)

> "The cycle from democracy to oligarchy often looks like this:
>
> First, a large democratic group is formed. Everyone tries to have a say. This creates conflict, and all discussions go on for a long time as they try to resolve the conflict. Most people leave because the decision-making process is taking too long.
>
> Eventually, fewer people remain and some of them present their plans. The crowd picks the plans that make the most sense and the planners get designated as leadership.
>
> The planners slowly turn into the elite and start to reinforce their power. These elites also begin to control access to information and become progressively less and less accountable to the rank and file members.
>
> Over time, the oligarchy develops values that are at odds with its regular members. Elites become higher status, and feel that they must have some way of [differentiating themselves from the democratic masses](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/beliefs-are-fashions). They slowly begin to push for things that are [good for elites but not necessarily good for the rest of the group](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-hypocrisy-of-elites).
>
> Once it is in place, democratic members lack the means to displace the oligarchy. It would require coordination that democracies simply don’t have. Additionally, the oligarchy won out as the most effective structure due to its strategic capabilities. For this reason, in any formally democratic organization, power will always slowly disperse away from members and into the hands of an elite." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=The%20cycle%20from,of%20an%20elite.)

The Personal Responsibility Vortex: Bret Weinstein at TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjNRtrZjkfE
Bret's point is that there is a positive feedback loop between lobbying and making more money due to lobbying which affords more lobbying - aka regulatory capture. We need to engineer a negative feedback force that is adequate enough to constrain such unstable and self-terminating feedback loops.
This unconstrained feedback loop is perhaps the biggest contributor to wealth and power concentration.
Furthermore, people and corporations that do the right thing often disadvantage themselves (often in the form of having less money) which leaves them with less power which leads to further disadvantage - Bret calls that the "Personal Responsibility Vortex".
This personal responsibility should be directed towards collective action aimed at restructuring the incentives that surround the market and chanring the malignant behavior.
All costs and negative externalities (polution & environmental damage, even debt for future generations) need to be accounted for.
All manufactured demand needs to be called out.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for adaptive evolution are: 1) reproduction, 2) variation, 3) heritibility, 4) differential success.
What if we could engineer an informational environment where truth and error correction is the dominant strategy through the right incentives and mechanisms for collective action?
Reputation, structured data that anyone can analyze, and deduplicating concepts, entities & events are a big part of that.
We can engineer our fitness landscape.

catastrophes vs dystopias - the 2 attractors of chaos & centralization

We're a mindless & unconscious energy-hungry superorganism with an embedded growth obligation in its economy & monetary system that is unable to contract and a lack of an immune system against market failures such as negative externalities and the exploitation of human psychology.

Ephemeral posts vs timeless and perpetually ongoing polls and rankings
So much energy is wasted down the drain in ephemerality
Also:

the inability for anyone to programatically process public data flexibly and reliably in any way imaginable limits our capacity for collective self-introspection and error correction. The host-centric model must go.

We need to develop the mechanisms to continually bring our theory of the collective mind closer to reality and that involves error correction, reputation, transparency, and immutable history.



There is no bigger meta-goal than improving our capacity for cooperation and sensemaking. Nothing is beyond that.
there isn't anything bigger than trying to optimize the antroposcene


different scroring criteria are different models of the world - different lenses

Our world is hopelessly broken - the american dream has been dead for decades and this is the culminatiom?!

we hold concepts in our minds singularly and can "browse" our memories that are connected to them - however/albeit inperfectly. But in the digital world concepts and entities are fractured and duplicated - there are many instances of the same thing and information is incoherent

We all feel a sense of desperation because things don't function well

We need to counter our evolutionary baggage such as keeping up with the joneses or any bias that is nowadays maladaptive

We can gradually reshape the matrix from the current form towards a crowdsourced one: A new world order - built upon consent and competence

If people are empowered to affect their system they will be inclined to think more about how it should function. When you buy a stock or asset - even with a tiny bit of capital - you start learning about markets and the specific asset you’ve bought. Skin in the game is empowering

In retrospect we will wonder how we could be contempt with what social media was in the first few decades of this century

Light is the best disinfectant

Amplification choice and transparency

Unique notification signatures (sounds, vibrations, icons, colors) help us disambiguate between sources and we can have less need to instantly check where the notification came from
Ambiguity sets off a mental process of us wandering “What was that?” - hiding the punchline, stimulating arousal, and leading to distraction

inconsequential notifications ("someone liked your photo") don't need to be delivered immediately - they can be batched - instead of the current way


Credits for queries - monetization for infra companies

People that have to use social media for work but dont want to get distracted can make different presets for the UI with different restrictions

How do we deprogram ourselves from the legacy from edward bernays


we are digital slaves - we don't truly own our data and we don't have a say what can be done with it. We are restricted in the actions we are allowed to take



“Closer to truth”
We must empower those with predictive power



your public process of doing something for others gives you credibility how well you're doing and that gives weight to your vote on something.

post physique reddit - how about post food? how about we crowdsource marketing for what we truly love and drown out advertising from broadcast media?

memes encode semantic structure - the one with Anakin and ", right?" as a template always has the same structure. We are pattern matching slots of ideas and expressions visually - how further could we push the encoding of information for more efficient communication?

we are at the absolute other end of the spectrum of where we should be - having just 2 main political views and media being aligned with them. We need to shard our attention into a million pieces

the next iteration of the mechanism and experiment that is America will be global and digital

heck, why don't we vote on our own top movies list like the oscars


Prestige should be based on predictive ability - track record and skin in the game












what if we had views with different levels of granularity and detail for the whole picture? one set of humans are labelers - a task that is easily checkable and quite unambiguous, but the actual view of the world was produced by combining different labelers with different weights based on their reputation? Neural nets have many layers - feature recognition, etc.

# Exploring the Matrix

Toggling layers of the graph or whatever - monetary layer - how money and influence flow

we should be able to look up if person X has ever made a statement about X, and what they said - for example how do you currently query all the podcasts of Naval if he has ever said anything about Edward Snowden? How do you query that? You simply can't.







accountability should be the gold-standard


The 8th social sin is power
Power must be earned

Epistemological bankruptcy - AI

If we publicly vote on interests it would be easier to form communities

Increasing the capacity to introspect globally

The internet 1.0 was connecting machines. The internet 2.0 connects ideas

This is how to collectively build our grand unifying narrative

The freedom to interact

What is the analog of active noise cancelling in the digital world?

Identity is about information and relations - transactionality is orthogonal


This is ultimate freedom in how we globally dissipate information

This is the interoperability protocol of the gaming metaverse as well

Artificial global intelligence is agi alignment

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

THIS IS AI ALIGNMENT - this is the alignment problem.
1. we must all have access to the data as easily and effortlessly as possible
2. we must use the crowdsourced competency and non-cancellation score when giving different weights of opinions.

Current AI is compression. Compression of sentiment

the way to alignment is towards increased transparency and accountability between us - we must create a cooperation environment to "train" (aka compress) the AI on

who watches the watchmen - who watches those that set the weights when training the models? what if the complete training could be separated into chunks as snapshots and we could occasionally pay extra to re-run the same part of the algorithm and compare results between expected and produced



imagine a media app and a set of algorithms and configuration options presented as a spreadsheet where for every cell someone is responsible, and the election for that cell is public and contains a debate map where we can filter the inputs of people based on the rules we determine are appropriate for us




Imagine a sankey diagram with the money flows

Also sankey diagram for liquid votes and influence


Giving a unique identifier to any concept and entity - the great deduplication

we're not going to stumble upon order as a byproduct of incremental changes - we have to rebuild everything from the ground up

== immune system chapter
We can crowdsource the weights for any algorithm
We need to shift the incentives from content to pure signal, delegation and actual impact
stated preference != revealed preference (aka behavior)!
    Just because I clicked on a car crash video or a cute cat doesn't mean thats all I want to see from now on
    stated vs revealed: I don't want to eat sugar, but I can't stop myself if I'm anywhere near it




== weights and parameters in algorithms
== crowdsourced algorithm weights & parameters & content modulation



we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

what if reputation had a computable value which you couldn't trade, but simply compute? No way to buy your way in - the only way being through a long enough track record?

Concern: no way to add friction when spreading information with sharing - how do you enforce that a link cannot be shared unless you’ve actually visited it? How do we combat the sharing of information based solely on the titles? Perhaps the signalling and labeling can come into play - ppl can show that a given app is not playing according to the good rules
Same about limiting the number of shares for a piece of content - perhaps up to 2 or 3 hops/levels
The further down a reshare chain (a reshare of a reshare of a reshare) - the more the distortion (razvalen gramofon)
If you want to share further beyond some limit you’d have to explicitly copy/paste it - this removes toxicity beyond a certain level

There should be no “magic/secret sauce” when it comes to recommendation algorithms. And we need to put the weights in the control of the users

We should think more carefully about the weights we give when ranking interactions
example: twitter's algorithm favors replies and gives a boost
what about CAD’s theorem of topic culture. A smart is less likely to receive a reply than a stupid post because it leaves less to be said, but a really full and comprehensive post will bring the conversation to a halt. 

Weights - should the reactions of someone who spends 8 hours a day online have the same weight as someone who reacts once a week or month? What if someone is producing 100 or 1000 times more content than the average account or more than the 99th percentile - should their ability to influence the ranking be the same as everybody else? Perhaps once you go beyond the activity of the 99th percentile you should start getting less and less impact for your actions for a rolling window
Compulsive social media users can (and do!) influence the algorithms for the rest of us
Something like the gini coefficient - capping and/or modulating the influence someone can have on the rest of us
Most people’s experience is asymmetrically influenced by “the compulsive few”
“The few, the proud, the compulsive”
Socially isolated people lean heavily on social media
Viral outbursts of anxiety


These are the types of questions and design decisions we’re simply not having and participating in because we’re outsiders for the social media platforms


What if there was a way to signal your preferred solution every time you comment on a problem? And what if we boosted responses that offer solutions/improvements? Inspired by solutions journalism

what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?

what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature

What if anyone could analyze the history of reactions of a post and see if there was an initial coordinated boost by some clique of connected accounts from a troll farm? Currrntly such analysis can be done only by insider data analysts

Identity can be computable





what if we could signal "back me up" for specific posts - leveraging our audience for select issues?

Feedback loop - you see what tags your audience expects and they see your content by tags if you’ve tagged it (or they could use AI to classify but that could be ambiguous)

We can show things in progress - suck as quitting smoking or participating in some challenge - justin.tv but with structured data

What if IDMs had to burn the native token when creating new accounts in a way similar to 1559? And what if this 1559 was not shared but per-idm? So that each IDM is throttled economically according to their own speed of growth?

There is no integration without extreme deduplication of data and identities











== ability to crowdsource badges/labels on accounts

> "The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress—the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system’s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness). Defined in this way, “stress” turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term duḥkha (otherwise often rendered as “suffering”), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so duḥkha is a continuous state that compels beings to act. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of “make and maintain a whole limb” of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives. It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=The%20central%20treadmill,of%20other%20beings.)

> "Stress drives agents towards homeostatic goals—a concept central to Buddhism with its teaching of existence as dissatisfaction, duḥkha. Expanding one’s space of possible goals to face outwards, exhibiting compassion toward other agents’ goals, potentiates the increase of intelligence and thus the potential to identify better, more global solutions. In this scheme, compassion (in the sense of practical concern) and intelligence are tightly linked because the driving definition of an active agent is the bundle of processes that expend energy toward system-level goals. The scale and content of what a given agent measures, prefers, and seeks to implement define its cognitive sophistication." - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710#:~:text=Stress%20drives%20agents,its%20cognitive%20sophistication.)

> "The evolution of brains is a story of increasingly coordinated collective behavior, driven by the emergence of more efficient forms of intercellular communication, increasing differentiation and specialization of cell types, increasing interdependence, and progressive refinement of organization. At each stage, the benefits achieved through cooperation must have outweighed the costs of increased competition for resources that comes with sharing territory. Thus, we view brains as one end of a continuum of collective behavior wherein the collective has become especially coordinated and complex in organization." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Neural structure is not hard-coded into the genes — indeed, there couldn’t possibly be enough information in the human genome to encode neural structure — but instead is robustly reproduced time and again through these competitive dynamics. Malfunction of these processes (i.e., overproduction of neurons or lack of pruning) is associated with a number of brain disorders. Along these lines, proponents of “Neural Darwinism” and related views suggest that brain development, and intelligence more generally, can be understood as analogous to the evolution of a species through variation and selection." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’" - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20theory%20begins,the%20%E2%80%98body%20schema.%E2%80%99)

Converging evidence from both psychology and neurophysiology suggests that the brain relies on a set of relatively robust, but ultimately limited, tricks in order to compute the configuration of the body. Though these tricks tend to work well under normal circumstances, laboratory scenarios can be devised that result in the dissociation of the body schema and the actual configuration of the body." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=the%20body%20schema%20appears,configuration%20of%20the%20body.)

For example, if you have any intuitive understanding of attention, of its dynamics and consequences for behavior, and if you are concerned about your diet, then you know not to stand all night next to the dessert tray at a party.

Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=awareness%20is%20part%20of%20the%20control%20mechanism,effect%20on%20behavior%20than%20it%20would%20otherwise.)

"individuals as neurons" chapter
the current host-centric world where platforms own our data and is siloed is preventing us as a giant global brain to wire any way we want


THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?








index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes




"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"




== The global connectome

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

we have maladaptive connections and lack (neuro)plasticity. The global brain lacks (neuro)plasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity



we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
inherit algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!




we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy








we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)























youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.













We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types - even if we have just watched a video like that?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?































https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory




== Computable context & SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs

what if we could see all the unique assertions a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that? What if we could analyze how their views changed throughout time?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts

what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?











shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"










we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability












Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations











deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

        - not incentivized

== ideas for apps:
- feed composer - from subscriptions - with pipes


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color




The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet




What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



unlocking the potential of the internet

Aiming to make politics downstream of science - not the other way around

Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.


apps that consume private indexes but done according to public rules and get them uniquely fingerprinted so that leaks are detected, those apps can stake a token in something escrow-like with an amount determined by market forces, and those that produce the indexes and give them with unique fingerprints could slash and/or confiscate their stake

can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model


2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership


Public actions should be regarded as public contributions



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"



global questions will have URIs that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"


NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing


make a mission section with a bunch of mission statements - that all come together in a whole


being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.


move from @handle to full names in citations in the book

So many ideas that can be implemented as a hackaton at any of the big social media companies are never even attempted - because it doesn’t serve their bottom line. Thats why the host-centric model must go

Logo/Cover photo idea: headjack which extends as a vortex/fractal of interconnectedness

== double addressing?
headjack://app_id/nonce/user_id/content_id
headjack2://user_id:concept_id


when we give a universal address to any item extensibility becomes trivial. Suppose you have a list of movies and you want to edit it in a way that's not allowed by the UI - what if you could write a script to fetch it, process it and re-upload the new version?


The 2 dirtiest words when it comes to the Twitter API: "rate limited" - read "innovation & insight limited"

we should disincentivize engagement farming

The google index for public data is private - it should be public infrastructure

fine-grained control
When viewing a post - have the ability to choose wether to respect the OP’s blocks and not see comments from blocked users or not


Economics is downstream of coordination


there isn't an ounce of fat to remove from this design - anything more minimalistic would complicate the mental model for working with the system.

!! NOT REALLY - identity


== clips
== improving audio & video

if someone uploads a clip someone can link it to the original content with timeline mapping so that one can view the original instead of the clip if they wish - similar to the "title change for less clickbait" stuff
"DISINCENTIVIZING DUPLICATION"
Todo: chapter about the movie maker - the timeline composer
clips are dysfunctional
clips are reuploaded because uploaders would get the revenue... this needs a solution

a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

As a large language model trained by OpenAI, ... just kidding.

What happens to URIs with names that get used in a blob which doesnt get anchored immediately and name ownership changes before it gets anchored?
