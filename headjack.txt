WITH TECHNOLOGY, WE CAN FINALLY UPGRADE THE WAY WE PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNMENT
Imagine:
THE MOST INFORMED AND INCLUSIVE NATION-WIDE DEBATES POSSIBLE
RESEARCH-DRIVEN POLICY DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT THE POLITICS
TOTALLY INCLUSIVE AND TRANSPARENT REPRESENTATION


> "We waste so much time repeating old arguments and running in opposite directions. The internet looked like it would ease the problem by giving us access to vast knowledge and each of us a voice. It seems to have made the situation worse by overwhelming us with disorganized, contradictory information. Social media amplifies bias and creates echo chambers." - ["Canonical Debate Lab" paper](ttps://github.com/canonical-debate-lab/paper#i-abstract:~:text=We%20waste%20so,creates%20echo%20chambers.)

> "The problem is structural in nature, and therefore can be solved with a structural fix." ["Canonical Debate Lab" paper](https://github.com/canonical-debate-lab/paper#i-abstract:~:text=the%20problem%20is%20structural%20in%20nature%2C%20and%20therefore%20can%20be%20solved%20with%20a%20structural%20fix.)

> "The state of debate as it occurs online is particularly ineffectual and disorganized. None of the technologies in use today (with the exception of email and a few others) were available twenty years ago, and yet with this incredible growth in capability, we have failed to address fundamental issues with deliberation, and created many new ones."

Larger vocabulary means better data compression – fewer words needed to express concepts – so higher data rate
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636421504538738689



messages
if we merkleize them by words we could then quote parts of long documents with proofs that the partial quotes are indeed part of the original files



ON WHY WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE linktree:
Twitter product request: a custom tab on my profile page i can pin my top 25 tweets — perhaps label it “best of @jason”
https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1636464901911904257




we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

clips are dysfunctional

what if we could see all the unique claims a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts


> "We're in the stage where ML model-generated text is going to accelerate the rate of data accumulating on the internet and lower the average quality. This data deluge will degrade trust and user experience across a variety of platforms, increasing pressure on moderation and curation. Combine these trends with accelerating progress in AI and it will be near impossible for one individual to track the changes happening in their own information ecosystem." - [GPT4: The quiet parts and the state of ML](https://robotic.substack.com/p/gpt4-review?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=auto_share&r=68gy5#:~:text=We%27re%20in%20the,own%20information%20ecosystem.)




remove bannon quote - or at least his name


search engine infra stuff and separating presentation from data could perhaps go to the "organizing information" chapter

GGG as a page?

maybe the chapter should be called "web3 & the semantic web"

move CAs to cryptohistory?


concern: a complete mess of message types with overlapping functionality

== double addressing?
headjack://app_id/nonce/user_id/content_id
headjack2://user_id:concept_id

The price of authority is legitimacy and reputation/track record/authenticity

what if we all had points for signal boosting beyond a simple like - like with claps in medium
what if we could signal-boost anything - like "ppl with large following all endorse X futuristic and hopeful movie"
chapter: signal-boosting

People can still consume text and audio but they’d have the option to trace and inspect the inputs & how the sosage is made

What if we could say “deboostt celebrity gossip/news” and if the people we follow have deboosted that that we inherit part of their preferences?

chapter: "the metaverse is a graph"
the metaverse is a giant global graph

upgrading the internet beyond the physical

"individuals as neurons" chapter
the current host-centric world where platforms own our data and is siloed is preventing us as a giant global brain to wire any way we want

what if DeSci was part of this giant global graph/brain? observation, experimentation, and the testing of theories against the evidence obtained - with an immutable trail behind


THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?















We could upgrade our ability to collectively introspect & investigate




In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity

work doesn't even need to be different to be processed by different companies - the same layer can be communally serviced & the cooperation mechanism can be auctioned to the best orchestrator. WTF did I even type?

what if we had an LLM that we could ask to find the right filters, inputs and weights to find the best of X, and they would construct us a search preset that is best suited for our needs.

index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

we can express our values as public preferences, and we win in 2 ways: we actually get the type of information we've requested, and we get to add to aggregates that include your preferences


user's ability for fine grained control over their information diet through choice & options is the way towards transparency
This is identity


have a chapter or even page about the cathedral and the bazaar?

we're currently screaming out our beliefs in comments of the culture war when instead we could express our view only once and have it fed through the algorithms where it would actually be taken into account



indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes

we can have an anonymized debate at scale between millenials vs boomers or gen X-ers

this somehow fits in this narrative now
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage

global questions will have entities that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"

"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"

We can signal to ourselves signal by signal

we can construct debate maps for any topic



This is the way to decentralize AGI and collectively own & steer it
The way to decentralizing AGI is through collective ownership & steering
The way to the AGI is through collectivization

we have maladaptive connections and lack neuroplasticity. The global brain lacks neuroplasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

strength is in the numbers
VS.
We can reveal only what we don't think we'd be judged about, but still anonymously express concerns - this way the majority cannot silence any minority

we are a circuit board with no elements & connections - a clean canvas we can collectively sense-make ourselves through to the other side - a functioning signal & value amplifier

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

apps that consume private indexes but done according to public rules and get them uniquely fingerprinted so that leaks are detected, those apps can stake a token in something escrow-like with an amount determined by market forces, and those that produce the indexes and give them with unique fingerprints could slash and/or confiscate their stake

we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
imagine configuring your feed like "I want to see this type of thing and that other one, and also I want to follow these accounts from these sources for anything new by them and I'd also like to inherit their algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!

!!!
We can see the beliefs of whoever goes public and we can actively count their stated public preference. There could be a KYC-like service to point 
!!!

what if we could maintain rankings such as "the top 10 or 50 things I think everyone should have read and/or seen" and "what are the top 10 most pressing issues" and have that surfaced objectively - by whoever dares to speak out - we could publicly rank our concerns


we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy

"here are the 5 things that have made the biggest impression on me (or are the most underrated): "and actually list them! MC course, Carl Sagan's cosmos, Naval, Fall of civilizations. We can signal values and from that public info later decide which people to join/partner with towards a common cause. We can make a heatmap of the global (& local!) causes that people care about, and to what degree

Separate type of connection for friendlyness

not only sensemaking but also meaningmaking - collective progress and transparency through immutability, identity, deduplication & connectedness

Fractal protocol - whats possible with your private data

the metaverse is about agency - the ability to express yourself any way you want

imagine being able to organize the world as folders of bookmarks on a desktop, through which you start interacting with the information however you wish (to the limits of what's available ofc)

we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)

Custom feeds. There's a type of news that we're interested in so we keep checking back in at social media and scroll through the feed for it. What if we could set preferences for what to be notified about - with a custom feed?

inoreader for example allows you with a paid feature to construct rules for subcriptions such as "mark as read anything that contains the string #shorts" - we can have this, but generalized and for anything

moving from XXX consumption to deliberate consumption of media

what if we could signal preferences locally for what types of commercials we'd be OK with in our city - could this be the backbone for the nation state?
















How could we reward people for annotating content? Perhaps in a way that reaches consensus even with "the other side"?
We could engineer the dopamine of this informational global brain.
pagerank for people - depending on the delegations in the liquid stuff
TODO: read the twitter community notes whitepaper



The limiting factor: data processing & computation



a long video citing a bunch of external documents - we should be able to react differently to each and every external citation and have a discussion about each of them

Sensemaking chapter - video replies without interlinking specific moments is just primitive
How do we debunk stuff?
Moonlanding faked?
Ancient technology in egypt? Give links as evidence

youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.





what if instead of caring if someone liked your nonsense tweet you had cast a vote and can see if others vote the same way as you - not liking a textual comment of yours, but you influencing them to vote the same way you did






Computable context





We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?


we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?


what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?


Its all about choice & agency.


why can't we crowdsource "top 10 videos that everyone should watch"


what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature










"fork anything"

"your personal space"


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory



If we can annotate facts and claims then we’d be able to track the provenance of ideas - or at least view their first occurance



what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?








== SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs













shared context - common knowledge - enables more efficient communication
we communicate more efficiently within groups when we have inside jokes
we build dictionaries for efficient communication

duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"











we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability




heatmaps





imagine being able to crowdsource debate requests with specific people and see a ranking of which debates are most desired





imagine browsing the public web like it was your personal files in your apps and drives - having total control of how you store and group that data. This could be the case with the public web. And we could advertise what kind of filters & grouping options we prefer with public messages which are not options. we can crowdsource preference and show which things are preferred. We can end the binary duopoly in politics by making all opinions and interests unbundled from each other


Global vs local for the feed - locality of information & notifications!



Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations



twitter has different subcommunities (FinTwit,AudioTwit,CT) - specialized UIs can have value flow embedded in them so different & unique business models could be used



imagine being able to select a subset of all accounts worldwide and train a GPT on that subset of human knowledge & opinions








deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

"Fifth, Ethereum storage layout carries a huge overhead. The Ethereum storage layout highly relies on Keccak and a huge MPT[4], both of them are not zk-friendly and have a huge proving overhead. For example, Keccak hash is 1000x larger than Poseidon hash in circuit. However, if you replace Keccak with another hash, it will cause some compatibility problems for the existing Ethereum infrastructure."

Accounts are integers and the state tree should reflect that - doesnt need to be a trie based on crypto addresses

1.3mb/s data availability for celestia requires 1gb/s speed

- unsure:
    - not sure if the historic record of blocks should be:
        - incentivized
            - perhaps for Headjack it should be baked into the protocol the way Arweave does it?
        - not incentivized
        - scrapped altogether - and put historic hashes in the actual state - making it bigger
    - what finality guarantees do I want?
    - throughput requirements
    - big question regarding scale: should the interest graph go on-chain?
        - historical storage not necessary about the state of the interst graph - only for the proofs for anchored content (merkle root + IPFS CID)
        - in-protocol incentivization?

- transition path for my project? different DA layer and moving away from the EigenLayr smart contracts?

- DataLayr
    - is the DA layer shared by all rollups using DataLayr and will they fight for resources?
        - will many separate rollups on DataLayr share the same 10MB/s of DA throughput that has been achieved on the testnet with 100 nodes?
    - direct IPs and not using a p2p layer?
        - could DataLayr have been p2p and without public IPs?
        - how come DoS attacks are avoided too? mentioned here: https://youtu.be/OtUOXTqrSyg?t=1542

- Q: why is it hard to hard-fork a standalone chain but easier if consensus & DA are coming from Celestia?

██████ unsorted


There should be a vision for how others can capitalize on the opportunity and be the heroes


start with the problems in each page?


We need more feedback and error correction


Making physical location obsolete for the digital world


DEFRAGMENTATION !!!
Solution to the disjoint documents saved by IDMs - compaction through re-publication?
Separate messages into header and payload so that only the header could be stored for deleted items - but it would contain the metadata such as “reply_to” uri and its own uri for example



what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...


streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid



For old uris where names have changed ownership - can display obsolete names with different color


elly iska6e da iztrie komentar na snimkata si - dori i da moje da bude komentirana drugade s URL... proximity matters...


The two killer apps of crypto are finance and identity, with the latter one not done properly (yet)


Web3 is the end of the host-centric internet


Offchain name registry


What if edits are disallowed from other apps? Then there will be only one entity to ask for updates. This can be a message attribute



What is a broker? IDB and not IDM?



unlocking the potential of the internet



Merging email, instant messaging & publishing - Email 2.0


claim: this is the boldest attempt at reenvisioning the web



ending the host-centric model and linking data to identity enables flexibility to rewire our interaction circuits in any way imaginable

the host-centric model is a hindrance to the evolution & composability of the digital world


"the promise of decentralized identity & media"



Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.



> "Open state is the next step after open source. You don’t just release a copy of the frontend, you let anyone read and write to the same backend." - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1632833998442614784)



can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model



2 types of apps: sharing (anyone can download the data) and closed (host-centric)


Youtube is just video on the internet along with a recommender algo - completely unimaginative


The killer feature of digital identity & media is programmability by anyone

@mentions can also be stable! even if names (handles) change ownership



TODO: try this service to read the text out loud?
https://beta.elevenlabs.io/



can produce ZKPs for off-chain counts & aggregates and submit those to transactional settlement layers as smart contract inputs



the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"


> "Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world." - [A Cypherpunk's Manifesto by Eric Hughes, 9 March 1993](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html#:~:text=Privacy%20is%20the%20power%20to%20selectively%20reveal%20oneself%20to%20the%20world.)



NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing


make a mission section with a bunch of mission statements - that all come together in a whole


being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.


move from @handle to full names in citations
