██████ giant global graph

suppose a story is written by you - wouldn't you want to fact-check it when it is concerning you?

- different templates of what should be displayed next to something

- rebuttals
- disabled comment sections - why?
- name change suggestions - countering clickbait - in stackexchange even the question title can be edited by others!
- forks of something
- disabled youtube comments - but comments on reddit for the youtube link

██████ knowledge graphs & the semantic web

- knowledge graphs & deduplicating all concepts/events/claims with a single representation

██████ structured data, aggregation & integration

- moving away from text-based communication and towards structured data (which would enable much easier processing and aggregation)

Concepts and events are singular and unique, opinions are subjective and multi-perspectival

define different criteria for how to calculate any aggregate (vote/score)

- a lot less text would need to be moderated with structured data

- aggregation & structured data vs text-based communication & ephemerality

social media posts are ephemeral - they're irrelevant beyond the first couple of days (get burried with time) - they're promoted by the recommendation algorithms only for a a small amount of time as there's a constant stream of new events


instead of thousands of scattered duplicates across many disparate platforms and websites

██████ unique representation & deduplication for any event/concept/entity/question

we use symbols and categories in our minds and there's a single representation for any concept/entity/event - we should do the same for the global brain

- Wikipedia - no more than 1 entry for anything
- StackExchange - most duplicates are resolved - we can do even better with incentives

with or without propositional logic

"Perfect is the enemy of good." - Voltaire
https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/108491-perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good

we all want to express ourselves
we all have opinions on different things with differing competences
how do I express what should be taught in school - like how money works? Or dieting and avoiding sugar?


recursive self-reflection requires that any concept/entity/event has a single entry that can be referenced, and from then branch towards whatever else needs to be queried. unifying all concepts/entities/events under unique entries is a foundation for optimal recursive thought

██████ Separating claims from truthfulness

debate

annotation

concentrating the discussion and arguments/contention to a single place, annotation and linking to media pieces is separate

fact-checking billions of people doesn't scale. incentivizing the correct labeling/tagging of assertions and fact-checking assertions only once scales.

██████ The Oracle problem - fact databases

- non-existent - because nothing here is transactional

- not transactional - we can branch & fork our knowledge bases
- 
- override a "fact" database only for some facts

██████ Annotation/tagging & incentives

+1 if no contestion, -3 if contested & escalated to a higher level with ruling against you

██████ Relevance Realization & visibility templates

Relevance realization: given the near-infinite complexity of the world, how do we intelligibly ignore irrelevant information and zero in on that which is relevant to us?

> "The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook." - [David Brooks](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7221905-the-art-of-being-wise-is-the-art-of-knowing)

credit to John Vervaeke

ranked lists - top10, top50
- values? meaning?
- what everyone else should watch/read?
- on any question/concept/event - what are the top10 most important resources?

choice ranking - is (collective) relevance realization

Wisdom is about decision pruning
Combinatorial explosions - how do we deal with that?

shared intentionality !!!

- remember the giant global graph where anything could refer to anything and all that's queryable?
    - visibility templates - what types of data should be shown
        - competing templates - depending on who you trust

██████ status seeking monkeys

> "While you can outsource Bitcoin mining to a computer, people still mine for social capital on social networks largely through their own blood, sweat, and tears." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)]

redefining status

We can redefine status through aggregate computing



██████ programmable incentives - Social influence score

we can "bribe" others to do some task that needs doing by offering them
- higher voting weights
- higher ranking in recommendation algos - visibility boost

> "Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome." - [Charlie Munger](https://quotefancy.com/quote/1561882/Charlie-Munger-Show-me-the-incentive-and-I-will-show-you-the-outcome)



- decay?
- voting on how votes should be weighted
    - also which votes should be affected
- reward quickness?
    - reward quickness of changing your opinion from the "wrong" to the "correct" one?
- leaderboards, seasons & resetting status


- we can bet on people and build a track record of picking winners

██████ collective action problems:

we can "bribe" organisations as well if they do what we want them to
- open sourcing your code?
- opening up your pantents so we can all benefit from more collaboration?
- trying harder to account for externalities - although it would cost you more?
    - your advertising gets boosted within the ecosystem, or could even be suggested by default without paying anything
    - you get a higher score
    - your employees & leaders get a higher score

- engaging in planned obsolescence? ==> Penalty.

- Suppose a company makes tens of billions of earnings per year - why don't they direct 0.1-0.2% of their earnings towards fixing their Cobalt supply chains so that there isn't human slavery in the Congo?
- we need to be able to shame companies for their exploitative practices - whatever those may be (psychological, monetary, etc.)



██████ computed history & identity

- we stumble upon something that sounds OK by someone we've never heard of and we might point to them, when in fact they could have a horrible reputation.

- instantly query overlap of beliefs & values, also track record against a "fact" database of your choice


██████ reputation - PageRank for identities (not web pages), alignment, incentive design

consequence capture

The elephant in the room is human alignment

> "Have I done something for the common good? Then I share in the benefits." - [Marcus Aurelius](https://twitter.com/dailystoic/status/1688958269287755776)

██████ Appreciation points/currencies

- non-transferrable/transactional - simply for accumulation
- we can invent and create infinite new scoring systems and let people "vote" by giving their points to others

██████ Automated/implicit influence

- without you having to explicitly read what somebody has said?


██████ attention & availability cascades


"Attention is the cursor of consciousness." - Jim Rutt



who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience?






██████ futarchy, prediction markets & epistocracy

building
- reputation
- credibility
- accountability
- legitimacy
- prestige
in public

and getting more voting power

If you can provably and reliably predict the second and third-order effects of policies and have superior modeling of the world - you should be in charge.

██████ Competing views

We can give more weight to the opinions of those. And we can have different opinions


██████ Bayesian inference, agency, causality & modelling

Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

> "Truth is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations." - [John von Neumann](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/529908)

> "To understand the actual world as it is, not as we should wish it to be, is the beginning of wisdom." - [Bertrand Russell](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1081297)

> "There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs." - [Thomas Sowell](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1411380-there-are-no-solutions-there-are-only-trade-offs)

Agency requires making models of the future with causal simulations
minimizing surprise when predicting the world

██████ UNUSED STUFF

How do I easily query "has X ever expressed an opinion on this topic, an if so - what?"
Example: Wikipedia page about Utilitarianism - it has a criticism section. Why am I not able to query "show me all criticism of Utilitarianism from people I follow"?

TODO: ontology... big problem



new kinds of signals - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations

self-organization



any parameter of a social media could be put to a vote
we can put actual psychology professors in charge of the dials of recommendation algorithms and have them tune them in public - transparently


real time dashboards on global KPIs

ontological engineers

we can crowdsource what someone has said even if they don't have an account. And later when they make an account we can simply link the 2 entities/identifiers and have everything integrated.

Predictive processing
Predictive processing needs precision weighting - prioritizing one set of signals over another

More on predictions and structured data






We need to make a new adaptive landscape that’s not tied to money and resources and yet people would compete in it
No. Dont mention this

layering incentives


The design space for social media is vast - and is far from exhausted by tiktok, facebook and instagram





Democracy in its current form was conceived when we sent paper letters by horse between cities.

We can greate a global participatory social operating system with identity & incentive design as the foundation ang give rise to a true meritocracy.

how do we optimize society?
how do we make sure capital and human labor is allocated better?
