██████ collective action problems:

we can "bribe" organisations as well if they do what we want them to
- open sourcing your code?
- opening up your pantents so we can all benefit from more collaboration?
- trying harder to account for externalities - although it would cost you more?
    - your advertising gets boosted within the ecosystem, or could even be suggested by default without paying anything
    - you get a higher score
    - your employees & leaders get a higher score

- engaging in planned obsolescence? ==> Penalty.

- Suppose a company makes tens of billions of earnings per year - why don't they direct 0.1-0.2% of their earnings towards fixing their Cobalt supply chains so that there isn't human slavery in the Congo?
- we need to be able to shame companies for their exploitative practices - whatever those may be (psychological, monetary, etc.)




██████ Automated/implicit influence

- without you having to explicitly read what somebody has said?


██████ attention & availability cascades


"Attention is the cursor of consciousness." - Jim Rutt



who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience?






██████ Competing views

We can give more weight to the opinions of those. And we can have different opinions

> "The evolution of brains is a story of increasingly coordinated collective behavior, driven by the emergence of more efficient forms of intercellular communication, increasing differentiation and specialization of cell types, increasing interdependence, and progressive refinement of organization. At each stage, the benefits achieved through cooperation must have outweighed the costs of increased competition for resources that comes with sharing territory. Thus, we view brains as one end of a continuum of collective behavior wherein the collective has become especially coordinated and complex in organization." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Proponents of “Neural Darwinism” and related views suggest that brain development, and intelligence more generally, can be understood as analogous to the evolution of a species through variation and selection." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The dynamic reorganization of functional subnetworks in the brain and the massive interactivity of the brain is best understood through the lens of collective intelligence, akin to a crowd that efficiently forms an effective committee for each task on the fly." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The intelligence of brains is due not to precisely designed neural circuits that implement specific computations, but instead due to an intrinsic capacity for collections of neurons to spontaneously organize in service of survival of the group. " - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The structure and development of the brain is characterized by highly efficient and robust mechanisms of competition, cooperation, consensus building, and dynamic reconfiguration of neural coalitions." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Humans may have much to learn from neurons about constructing harmonious societies." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Collective intelligence in humans actually has little to do with how intelligent we are as individuals, and instead to the extent to which we are evolutionarily prepared for spontaneous interpersonal coordination." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Any question about adaptation on a population level becomes one of collective intelligence." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "There is little reason to expect collective intelligence to be restricted to any particular species or spatio-temporal scale of activity." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

██████ UNUSED STUFF

How do I easily query "has X ever expressed an opinion on this topic, an if so - what?"
Example: Wikipedia page about Utilitarianism - it has a criticism section. Why am I not able to query "show me all criticism of Utilitarianism from people I follow"?

Being able to query everything that relates to something and filter that - Integration

TODO: ontology... big problem
ontological engineers

LLMs as helpers for structured data

we can crowdsource what someone has said even if they don't have an account. And later when they make an account we can simply link the 2 entities/identifiers and have everything integrated.

new kinds of signals - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations





any parameter of a social media could be put to a vote
we can put actual psychology professors in charge of the dials of recommendation algorithms and have them tune them in public - transparently


More on predictions and structured data




What if web3 is not "the Internet of value" as in transactional value, but the internet of values?





We need to make a new adaptive landscape that’s not tied to money and resources and yet people would compete in it
No. Dont mention this

layering incentives

The design space for social media is vast - and is far from exhausted by tiktok, facebook and instagram





We can greate a global participatory social operating system with identity & incentive design as the foundation ang give rise to a true meritocracy.

how do we optimize society?
how do we make sure capital and human labor is allocated better?
