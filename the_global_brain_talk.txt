These are some of the topics that I'd hit in a presentation:
- what permissionless composability, extensibility and evolvability on top of an open architecture means and could enable
- social media and the internet through the lens of the latest consciousness theories and research
- attention allocation, today's algorithmic feeds and what giving users choice to compose their feeds could look like
- what a merger of twitter/youtube/facebook/wikipedia/stackexchange/(and basically everything from the web) into a mega-social-net could look like
- Liquid democracy (the ability to delegate your vote to others)
- PageRank but not for web pages but for identities - reputation based on competence, accountability and contribution
- viewing the same data from many different points of view & the ability to define different criteria for how to calculate any aggregate (vote/score) - different filters, criteria that we can vote on and collectively choose, etc.
- self-organization and complexification through bottom-up participation instead of top-down enforcement
- knowledge graphs and how we can have a single entry for any concept/event/claim instead of thousands of scattered duplicates across many disparate platforms and websites
- moving away from text-based communication and towards structured data (which would enable much easier processing and aggregation)
- privacy and anonymity
- an exploration of cooperation and an evolutionary take on why we need to aggregate into a global collective and reach coherence on what is true in order to tackle our greatest challenges
- all intelligence is collective intelligence - inspired by biology and nature

██████ TITLE

Internet 2.0: The Global Brain

██████ ABSTRACT

Suppose there was an architecture for identity, names, and content addressing that was global, decentralized & neutral (not owned by any corporation or organization), has practically unlimited scalability, has solved the UX problem of dealing with private and public keys (that crypto & blockchain struggle with) and goes beyond the host-centric (IP & DNS) web of today (hint: there is such an architecture). What could we build on top of it?

This talk will explore the transformation of the Internet and social media into a Global Brain - an informational meta-system transition. It isn't going to be very technical (0 code) but we'll explore the types of social and informational dynamics & interactions enabled by the permissionless extensibility & composability of an open system and we'll cover the following topics:

- transparency, openness, provenance & integration of information


- self-organization and complexification through bottom-up participation instead of top-down enforcement
- debate maps, relevance realization, Bayesian inference & collective intelligence (which is all intelligence)
- attention, availability cascades & algorithmic feeds that can be composed & configured by users
- social media and the internet through the lens of the latest consciousness theories and research
- what a merger of Twitter/YouTube/Facebook/Wikipedia/StackExchange/Quora/(and basically everything from the web) into a mega-social-net could look like
- privacy and anonymity
- sensemaking, consequence capture & solving collective action problems








██████ Background

Last year (code::dive 2022):
Decentralized identity & content addressing at web-scale with a non-financial app-specific blockchain

still in the research phase, no code/funding/token yet.

only a few details have changed since that talk - further simplification and making the design truly scalable

██████ key highlights & properties

- blockchain stores only what's essential - everything else is off-chain
- sovereignty of identity
- can scale to tens of billions of identities (including anonymous ones)
- solves the UX problem of blockchains & web3 of dealing with public & private keys ==> a web2 experience
- identify/address any event/document/action/content with just 4 integers
- has a name registry - URIs are persistent even after name ownership changes!
    twitter.com/5542/johnny/3 always resolves to the canonical form 2131/6235/77534/3
- can address practically unlimited amounts of off-chain data - both in terms of size and quantity
- does not handle storage & retrievability - that's left to other layers & services
- supports public/private data
- maximally flexible - anything can be built on top
- breaks the monopoly today's social networks have over the social graph and the data is no longer siloed
    - all apps will have programmatic access to all public data!
    - permissionless composability & extensibility
- some differences compared to the current web in terms of what's stored where and the right to be forgotten

██████ What can we do on top of this identity network?

Let's build the global brain







██████ Some cool things we could do

- Being able to see all the public activity of anyone no matter from which application and what type
- Multi-dimensional subscriptions - include/exclude based on user, application, content type, tag, keyword
- Universal bookmarks & playlists - across all apps ⇒ knowledge management tools on top of them
- Tunable notification settings in our IDMs
- Forking communities, moderation filters & UIs

We're in an asymmetric relationship with today's platforms - they've siloed our data and we're their captives.

We've been given a single one-size-fits-all algorithmic feed for our information diet that's solely optimizing for engagement & time WELL spent with their ad revenue as the most important metric.

We should be offended by the lack of choice & transparency

██████ liquid democracy

- direct vs representative vs liquid

- the ability to delegate your vote to others and split it for different topics

██████ Events vs State/Views

> "Data is the center of the universe; applications are ephemeral." - [The Data-Centric Manifesto](http://datacentricmanifesto.org/)

Same data/events, different points of view

viewing the same data from many different points of view - different filters & criteria

- different filters & criteria

A multi perspectival model of the world

██████ structured data, aggregation & integration

- aggregation & structured data vs text-based communication & ephemerality

- knowledge graphs & deduplicating all concepts/events/claims with a single representation

we use symbols and categories in our minds and there's a single representation for any concept/entity/event - we should do the same for the global brain



██████ giant global graph

suppose a story is written by you - wouldn't you want to fact-check it when it is concerning you?

- different templates of what should be displayed next to something

- rebuttals
- disabled comment sections - why?
- name change suggestions - countering clickbait - in stackexchange even the question title can be edited by others!
- forks of something
- disabled youtube comments - but comments on reddit for the youtube link



██████ Argument maps & reinventing debate

> "I believe this topic of Internet disagreement is the single most important problem of humankind. Why? Because exchanging ideas is how we make decisions in society, and how we make decisions drives everything else. If we can do that efficiently, humankind will solve every other problem more efficiently." - [Debate Is Broken. How to Improve It, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/debate-is-broken#:~:text=I%20believe%20this,problem%20more%20efficiently.)

██████ Separating annotation from debate

concentrating the discussion and arguments/contention to a single place, annotation and linking to media pieces is separate

> "Think about it. You get information inputs from journalists, from friends, from those you follow, from the websites you visit, the shows you watch, the conversations you participate on… You then process that information, by either thinking or intuition. And you output your own information signal by talking, writing, drawing… Others then go on and consume your output, to form their own thoughts, and create their own output." - [You’re a Neuron, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/youre-a-neuron?r=36xnz&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#:~:text=Think%20about%20it,their%20own%20output.)

> "Metasystems separate two qualitatively different levels of organization. The new level of organization must emerge from the coordination of new controls utilizing a new information medium for the integration of previously disparate subsystems." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)


> "The emergence of new levels of organization has occurred within the human system three times, and has resulted in three broadly defined levels of higher control, producing three broadly defined levels of group selection (e.g., band/tribe, chiefdom/kingdom, nation-state/international)..... by utilizing the evolutionary emergence of a more powerful information-processing medium (e.g., language, writing, printing press)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "This next metasystem may not be too far from fundamentally disrupting modern control structures, as radically new energy and information systems are developing and could form higher collective synergies than current information-energy systems." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "The emergence of a fundamentally new information medium and energy structure could suggest the beginnings of a metasystem transition towards a higher level of control. If true the first half of the twenty-first century could be characterized by a fundamental disruption to the operations of the nation-state and the stabilization of new higher forms of human organization. What we can learn from previous human metasystem transitions is that new controls will likely be organized utilizing the highest emergent information medium (in this case, the Internet as medium should play a crucial organizing role)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

██████ So what is the Global Brain?

> "The "global brain" is the name given to the emerging intelligent network that is formed by all people on this planet together with the computers, knowledge bases and communication links that connect them together. Like a human brain, this network is an immensely complex, self-organizing system, that processes information, makes decisions, solves problems, learns new connections and discovers new ideas. It plays the role of a nervous system for the whole of humanity. No single person, organization or computer is in control of this system: its "thought" processes are distributed over all its components." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)

> "The global brain is controlled by all the people that are part of it. It is not an autonomous system that could suddenly decide no longer to obey commands. The global brain's intelligence, indeed its "mind" or "personality", emerges from the actions of all people collectively." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)

> "The global brain perspective focuses on intelligence and fitness at the level of planetary society: the whole of humanity together with its artifacts and the ecosystems that it controls and relies on. This system of mutually dependent people, technologies and ecosystems defines the global superorganism." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf)

Democracy in its current form was conceived when people used horses to send paper letters for communication.

> "Nation-states were never built for global action. They are obsolete to the problems we need to solve." - [The End of Nation-States, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/the-end-of-nation-states?s=w#:~:text=nation%2Dstates%20were%20never%20built%20for%20global%20action.%20They%20are%20obsolete%20to%20the%20problems%20we%20need%20to%20solve.)
