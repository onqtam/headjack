Attention is all you have


"Attention is the cursor of consciousness." - Jim Rutt



who cares if a submarine imploded as compared to all of our greatest challenges - why does it get surfaced in the global conscience instead of what's more important? How do we regulate that?


"Attention is the only hard currency in the virtual world." - [Alexander Bard](https://recollectingphilosophy.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/internet-revolution-attentionalism-and-slow-thinking-with-alexander-bard-and-pierre-bourdieu/#:~:text=The%20decisive%20factor,rather%20than%20capitalist.)



██████ The design space for social media

The design space for social media 

it is vast - far from exhausted by Tiktok, Facebook & Instagram





competing views
We can give more weight to the opinions of those. And we can have different opinions

We need to make a new adaptive landscape that’s not tied to money and resources and yet people would compete in it
No. Dont mention this


layering incentives
new kinds of signals - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations
any parameter of a social media could be put to a vote
we can put actual psychology professors in charge of the dials of recommendation algorithms and have them tune them in public - transparently



Automated/implicit influence
- without you having to explicitly read what somebody has said?


We can greate a global participatory social operating system with identity & incentive design as the foundation ang give rise to a true meritocracy.


How do we optimize society?
How do we allocate capital and human labor better?
How do we get everyone to participate?
How do we create a true uncorruptible meritocracy?

██████ UNUSED STUFF

How do I easily query "has X ever expressed an opinion on this topic, an if so - what?"
Example: Wikipedia page about Utilitarianism - it has a criticism section. Why am I not able to query "show me all criticism of Utilitarianism from people I follow"?

Being able to query everything that relates to something and filter that - Integration

TODO: ontology... big problem
ontological engineers

LLMs as helpers for structured data

we can crowdsource what someone has said even if they don't have an account. And later when they make an account we can simply link the 2 entities/identifiers and have everything integrated.
