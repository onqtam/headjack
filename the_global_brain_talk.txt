These are some of the topics that I'd hit in a presentation:
- what permissionless composability, extensibility and evolvability on top of an open architecture means and could enable
- social media and the internet through the lens of the latest consciousness theories and research
- attention allocation, today's algorithmic feeds and what giving users choice to compose their feeds could look like
- what a merger of twitter/youtube/facebook/wikipedia/stackexchange/(and basically everything from the web) into a mega-social-net could look like
- Liquid democracy (the ability to delegate your vote to others)
- PageRank but not for web pages but for identities - reputation based on competence, accountability and contribution
- viewing the same data from many different points of view & the ability to define different criteria for how to calculate any aggregate (vote/score) - different filters, criteria that we can vote on and collectively choose, etc.
- self-organization and complexification through bottom-up participation instead of top-down enforcement
- knowledge graphs and how we can have a single entry for any concept/event/claim instead of thousands of scattered duplicates across many disparate platforms and websites
- moving away from text-based communication and towards structured data (which would enable much easier processing and aggregation)
- privacy and anonymity
- an exploration of cooperation and an evolutionary take on why we need to aggregate into a global collective and reach coherence on what is true in order to tackle our greatest challenges
- all intelligence is collective intelligence - inspired by biology and nature

██████ TITLE

Internet 2.0: The Global Brain

██████ ABSTRACT

Suppose there was an architecture for identity, names, and content addressing that was global, decentralized & neutral (not owned by any corporation or organization), has practically unlimited scalability, has solved the UX problem of dealing with private and public keys (that crypto & blockchain struggle with) and goes beyond the host-centric (IP & DNS) web of today (hint: there is such an architecture). What could we build on top of it?

This talk will explore the transformation of the Internet and social media into a Global Brain - an informational meta-system transition. It isn't going to be very technical (0 code) but we'll explore the types of social and informational dynamics & interactions enabled by the permissionless extensibility & composability of an open system and we'll cover the following topics:

- aggregation & structured data vs text-based communication & ephemerality
- transparency, openness, provenance & integration of information
- viewing the same data from many different points of view - different filters & criteria
- knowledge graphs & deduplicating all concepts/events/claims with a single representation
- liquid democracy (the ability to delegate your vote to others and split it for different topics)
- alignment, incentive design, game theory & reputation - PageRank for identities (not web pages)
- self-organization and complexification through bottom-up participation instead of top-down enforcement
- debate maps, relevance realization, Bayesian inference & collective intelligence (which is all intelligence)
- attention, availability cascades & algorithmic feeds that can be composed & configured by users
- social media and the internet through the lens of the latest consciousness theories and research
- what a merger of Twitter/YouTube/Facebook/Wikipedia/StackExchange/Quora/(and basically everything from the web) into a mega-social-net could look like
- privacy and anonymity
- sensemaking, consequence capture & solving collective action problems










██████ Background

Last year (code::dive 2022):
Decentralized identity & content addressing at web-scale with a non-financial app-specific blockchain

still in the research phase, no code/funding/token yet.

only a few details have changed since that talk - further simplification and making the design truly scalable

██████ key highlights & properties

- blockchain stores only what's essential - everything else is off-chain
- can scale to tens of billions of identities (including anonymous ones)
- solves the UX problem of blockchains & web3 of dealing with public & private keys ==> a web2 experience
- identify/address any event/document/action/content with just 4 integers
- has a name registry - URIs are persistent even after name ownership changes!
    twitter.com/5542/johnny/3 always resolves to the canonical form 2131/6235/77534/3
- can address practically unlimited amounts of off-chain data - both in terms of size and quantity
- does not handle storage & retrievability - that's left to other layers & services
- supports public/private data
- maximally flexible - anything can be built on top
- breaks the monopoly today's social networks have over the social graph and the data is no longer siloed
    - all apps will have programmatic access to all public data!
    - permissionless composability & extensibility
- some differences compared to the current web in terms of what's stored where and the right to be forgotten

██████ What can we do on top of this identity network?

Let's build the global brain

██████ Some cool things we could do

- Being able to see all the public activity of anyone no matter from which application and what type
- Multi-dimensional subscriptions - include/exclude based on user, application, content type, tag, keyword
- Universal bookmarks & playlists - across all apps ⇒ knowledge management tools on top of them
- Tunable notification settings in our IDMs
- Forking communities, moderation filters & UIs

We're in an asymmetric relationship with today's platforms - they've siloed our data and we're their captives.

We've been given a single one-size-fits-all algorithmic feed for our information diet that's solely optimizing for engagement & time WELL spent with their ad revenue as the most important metric.

We should be offended by the lack of choice & transparency
