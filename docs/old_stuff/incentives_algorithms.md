The public commons are gatekept and harvested by a select few platforms - we need to democratize access to what is public already

why can't we specify as a % what number of posts we should get in our feeds that aren't from our social graph but purely a recommendation?


deep personalization of a feed is anti-democratic - it siloes us in exchange of brave new world style personalized pleasure

what if you could use something snapchat-like, but without the streaks gamification that gets you back a lot more?

Making media consumption deliberate

We are what we eat but we are also what we watch

The current social apps exploit our social reciprocity - x follows you - follow them back! We should rethink our types of connections and the amount of persuation and manipulation apps can do to us

fragmentation
Perspective expansion vs perspective division/separation/certainty

The great attention misallocation

Notifications from social networks are hideously engineered to get you to get back in the app - we need to separate IDMs from apps


The internet is rife with (deliberate) misinformation



Why did YouTube decide that it should recommend a street fight video? In my SEARCH RESULTS?

there's a sociological asymmetry of power - those that produce data and those that have access to it



we have become much more visible to centralized institutions, corporations and governments, that can afford excellent data scientists and have easy programatic access to the data, but without this being reciprocal
Our behavior is not predictable, but we can't predict the behavior of institutions

whoever has the data wins. What if everyone has access to the data? We'd get the best possible services, not the most extractive services.

aggregators only innovate when they are threatened - we need an open ecosystem around identity to allow for evolution (mutation, heredity & selection)

current social media has a choice architecture in the UI that's misaligned with users - they're solely optimizing for engagement & time spent - the goals of people

we take the agency we have in search engines for granted (we explicitly type what we're looking for), but we've completely abdicated agency in the feeds that feed us information in social media - we ought to have a choice there as well
In search we are looking for something and want control. But aren't we looking for something in our feeds as well? Why not have more agency - even if it leads to less time spent on the app?

in the current web your interactions lead to better recommendations and better ads. In an open world your interactions would enable all kinds of insight that anyone could surface
open & shared knowledge graphs would unlock unimaginable services & insight - part of the cold start problem is lack of access to a knowledge graph
knowledge graphs bring context

today's media is an attention hijacker - one that shows us what is salient to us, but not necessarily what's true


misaligned incentives and the separation of IDMs from apps


Social media is not about pictures of what we ate - its a global coordination substrate

Current social media is stupefying us

Current social media is garbage- garbage in, garbage out

We as a society dont know ourselves en masse - only a few companies are in that position

Context switching is terrible for the brain - Twitter is an ADHD/ADD machine

the current system/algorithms aren't simply giving people what they want - they're manufacturing demand - they make people more predictable and train humans to stay more on the site.

We're the cattle and the platforms are our ranchers
The media incentive alignment problem: what we're allowed to do with public data with no programmatic access to it
"realigning incentives"
By severing the connection between identity management and media we can better align the incentives of these systems - our IDMs would not be harvesting our attention and we could tune the addictiveness & notifications

Headjack gives you the option to export your data away from any service which will lead to the best services

> "why, on god's sweet green Earth, am I being shown tweets by people I don't follow. I demand answers" - [Eridanus (9R)](https://twitter.com/eridanus_9r/status/1636794559886934016)

the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled & recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization
time well spent: user empowerment in being able to control what they want to see & how much of it

YouTube recently removed the option to sort the videos of a channel by oldest first - because why not - because they can.

the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized & undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.

VERTICAL INTEGRATION:
    Youtube now has posts like twitter where you talk to your subscribers - why a separate network ?! why are all these platforms reinventing the same features ?!

    Why does spotify need to build video streaming to compete with youtube?


when twitter decide engagement is low they shove down your throat nonsense algorithmic "recent tweets" notifications you can't turn off - that's what it has devolved into. "See less often" from the dropdown menu does nothing. Misaligned incentives.

> "Unfortunately, you cannot turn off recent tweets. This is because the feature drives up “user engagement”, which is a key metric that shareholders pay attention to." - [source](https://thisinterestsme.com/recommended-tweets/)

we should shift curation from explicit moderation by people to tagging & filtration preferences by the consumer

choice vs algorithmic recommendation

recommender algorithms incentivise clickbait. Explicit follow graphs incentivise quality & explicit recommendations by people you follow

recommender systems & search engines should NOT give you "other things you might be interested in" interleaved with the results for a specific query just to get you more engaged - but that's something YouTube is doing. You didn't ask for that but you got it

misaligned incentives

the 2 sides of "the consumer is always right":
- the brain stem one - whatever they engage the most with is the right thing
- the frontral cortex one - whatever they explicitly choose is the right thing















# Vertical integration vs markets/competition

Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages & trade secrets.

This leads to:
- lack of cooperation, interoperability, duplicated effort & stifled innovation
- competition for scarce talent which leads to sub-par solutions
- company bloat & inefficiencies
    - companies are harder to manage as they are way bigger than what they could be
    - bigger size demands higher revenue - pricing out many business models
- differences in functionality between platforms => complexity for users

Contrast that to open protocols & exportable data where anyone can specialize, innovate & provide the best possible service for a specific vertical & sell it to others. The move from [host to data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing and open blockchains enable [interoperability](https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/) and composability.

# Growth, network effects & monopolies

Social media platforms are growth-at-all-costs stories because the goal is to achieve a network effect first and become a monopoly with a [MOAT](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp) at which point the user [value extraction](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1473859531343949824) and cannibalization of ecosystems built on top of APIs can ramp up ([1](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/twitter-apis-ending), [2](https://nordicapis.com/twitter-10-year-struggle-with-developer-relations/), [3](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/meerkat-founder-on-getting-the-kill-call-from-twitter/), [4](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/), [5](https://mashable.com/article/gmail-ifttt-shutdown-google), [6](https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/04/11/how-to-kill-your-ecosystem-twitter-pulls-an-evil-move-with-its-firehose/?sh=4cd97d0f61d3)). At that point innovation is less necessary (+ is harder due to inertia) and even the quality of service may degrade. User data is the most valuable commodity and scale enables the best AI models & efficiency of value extraction in the advertising model which comes with a slew of problems & perverse incentives.

Users are usually locked-in and effectively have no [voice and exit](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1548725591687303168) either because:
- the network effects are insurmountable for incumbents and there are no alternatives
- or if they leave for an alternative service they'd lose all their connections, audience & reputation and would have to start from scratch

> "I think it might be reasonable to believe that single monolithic companies shouldn’t have monopolies on certain data that practically guarantees user lock-in. And that the internet might be better if some data were made completely open and available to any developer who wants to build on it while ensuring that the data can’t be edited by anyone that isn’t supposed to be able to edit it." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

> "Twitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols." - [source](https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg)

# The cold start problem for startups

The barrier to entry for most types of platforms is very high:
- kickstarting a network effect & attracting a critical mass is very difficult
- need to reinvent the wheel & [vertically integrate](TODO.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) many aspects instead of composing a service from already existing solutions

And thus few companies are started and even fewer are successful - leading to little innovation, slow progress & sub-par services.
