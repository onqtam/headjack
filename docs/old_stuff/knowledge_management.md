# Knowledge management

Tying data to identity and making it freely available & outside of silos through content-centric addressing enables a lot of composability, functionality & innovation.

> "However, to rely on purely idealism as a motivator of adoption is naive. We need a user experience that is much better than today and we need to invent tools that users will absolutely never attain in the Web 2 realm." - ["Social Web 3" by Zee Prime Capital](https://zeeprime.capital/social-web-3)

# Query & plot anything

There are no limits to the types of queries we should be able to make - some simple examples:

- `"Plot a timeline for all references to an event and filter based on some criteria."`
- `"Show me responses/references from high-trust individuals to the top 5 controversial statements of person X and sort them somehow."`
- `"When has person X talked about the gut microbiome and have they recommended/mentioned a product or company?"`
- `"Has anyone I follow or is connected up to N degrees of separation with me shared/mentioned X in the last Y days?"`

Companies with complex indexes & private knowledge graphs could charge for running queries.

# Forking media & communities

Most applications will have some kind of moderation & filtration but at any point in time anyone will be able to create a competitor with a different set of rules and/or functionality. Migration can be seamless and the activity of accounts could (and in most cases will) be displayed in both at the same time - but the preferred application will be signaled through the URIs of public actions.

Content coming from competitors could be completely banned but that would be shortsighted - data coming from somewhere else should be displayed as long as it is properly structured and actions from banned accounts can simply be shown as deleted in reply threads. Migration can be gradual with little fracturing of communities & the conversation.

# The future of publishing, knowledge & learning

Books as a medium imply transmissionism as the learning model - `"people absorb knowledge by reading sentences"` - which is wildly incorrect and inefficient. Let's ask this question:

> "How might we design mediums which do the job of a non-fiction book—but which actually work reliably?" - [Andy Matuschak - “Why books don’t work”](https://andymatuschak.org/books/)

Here's a good start:

    <!-- > "Books should be structured as expandable trees. One paragraph summary of each chapter, expandable into summaries of component points/stories, expandable into the full text. Can read the whole book in 5 minutes or 5 hours." - [Fred Ehrsam](https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/1304217384962592769) -->

- Outlines as hierarchical expandable trees (like a [GitBook](https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/)) and fractal reading (each chapter summarized in 1 paragraph, expandable on several levels if you want to dig deeper)
- Interactive [executable programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) with exercises & examples embedded in documents.
- Note taking, flash cards, etc.

But that's just scratching the surface - deduplicated open data, persistent URIs linked to identity, [intra-document addressing](#intra-document-addressing), and the ability to cache resources with proofs enables a lot more:
- View the discussion and comment on anything referenced externally with a URI - or parts of the book itself as they could also have their own URIs - or even paragraphs!
- Use tools like [Logseq](https://logseq.com/), [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) & [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) but on top of stable URIs & the [semantic web](#the-semantic-web-aka-the-original-web3) to build your own knowledge base as [bookmarks](#bookmarks--playlists) & a graph and share it if you want.
- Publications can be self-contained and permanent by including everything external for offline use with proofs for authenticity - that's how journalism should be done.
- Visualize your progress of going through an interconnected book as a color-coded map - an overview of what you've already looked at, how much time you've spent, and what's left.

<!-- We can leverage what we know about human cognition and drastically improve books and articles as a medium for knowledge transfer & retention - multi-level content (short vs detailed), different presentations (text, diagrams, graphs, knowledge maps), etc. -->

<!-- see [Francis Miller's work](https://www.francismiller.com/) - or don't - too much repetition and not that much insight -->

**Imagine constructing stories as interconnected documents, concepts & entities while wearing a VR headset by pulling from the semantic web & the open internet and publishing that as a self-contained & authentic package that anyone can save offline, explore & build upon.**

> "The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. The storyteller sets the vision, values and agenda of an entire generation that is to come" - [Steve Jobs](http://jovanabanovic.com/2020/08/06/the-most-powerful-person-in-the-world-is-the-story-teller-the-storyteller-sets-the-vision-values-and-agenda-of-an-entire-generation-that-is-to-come-steve-jobs/)

Let's empower them.

journalism is changing as more and more facts are accessible to anyone online in a sea of information - the future belongs to the narrators & curators -  those that dig through public data and expose corruption
