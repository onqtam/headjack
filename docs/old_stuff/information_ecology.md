# Today's information ecology

# Cultural fragmentation & filter bubbles

The same document may be published through different platforms and because of the host-certified web of today it will get multiple different URLs. Discussion around it becomes fragmented & shallow in the different platforms with separate comment sections and there isn't a way to de-duplicate & unify it. This facilitates polarization as separate echo chambers can form without seeing the opinion of other types of people.

<!-- Alienating large parts of the population & pushing them to alternative closed platforms is not a net benefit. -->

> "Echo chambers are intellectual oppression - as opposed to idea labs where ideas are treated as experiments." - [Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDwzBYsED4)

Instead imagine being able to view the entire discussion around a specific event by tracing & aggregating all of the re-publications, references & re-tweets & quotes of it from anywhere and applying any type of filter to that.

That is what interoperable identity, content-addressing & broadcasted data enables - we can connect and de-duplicate everything and allow anyone to build tools around that - constructing a much bigger graph that what Google have created for themselves.

# Moderation & censorship

This is an incredibly hairy topic with many aspects - here are just a few of them:

- No clear rules for moderation & censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
    - account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like [shadow banning](https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/)
    - accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)
- There is no way for users to "fork" a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.
- There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter & YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal [vertically integrated](TODO.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition) teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner. In an open system such as email the competition & innovation for solving spam has been tremendous.

we have a totally warped view of reality

we are at a position where the more we use social media, the worse we get at estimating what the other side believes

Arms race between social media companies

Journalists routinely write about events from social media - it is fundamentally entrenched in our society and it affects everyone - even those that do not use it.

broken media
culture war, algorithms, audience capture, misaligned incentives, lack of accountability

The culture war and division are fueled by corporate and media interests

long form media is rife with misinformation - in an open system we could better tag and discuss it

we should be able to see all referenced facts & entities in long-form media - much easier to check for disinfo

the inability to refer specifically to documents or parts of them linked to their source has made the internet a breeding ground for misinformation

audience capture

It’s an unorganized mess of information

Misinformation is a plague in videos without context

the health of reporting on the web through video is appaling - decentralization and democratization are powerful but without the means to interleave everything into a shared ledger of record and actually have some accountability it all becomes an informational mess. But YouTube doesn't optimize for that - not at all.

How Wisdom Can Protect Humanity from Technology
- runaway technology ==> complexity gap: complexity of the issues vs ability to make sense of the complexity
- GPT-3 & synthetic media

- anti-wisdom:
    - cognitive limits => information overload
    - dopamine => addictive use
    - social validation => influencer culture
    - confirmation bias => fake news
    - outrage => polarization
    - trust => bots & deepfakes

- social media creates perception gaps because of filter bubbles
    - "how good are you at estimating what the other side believes?"
    - what a group of ppl think vs reality
    - because the extreme views are overly amplified

- silicon valley - current paradigm vs humane technologist
    - give users what they 'want'       => respect human vulnerabilities
    - every tech has goods & bads       => minimize harmful externalities
    - we've always had moral panics     => 
    - maximize personalization          => create shared understanding
    - technology is neutral             => support fairness & justice
    - who are we to choose              => consciously center values
    - growth at all costs               => 
    - obsess over metrics               => help people thrive
    - capture attention                 =>

Not using instagram is too big of an ask - it means social separation. But what if... we make it easier to separate DMs from content & feeds we'd be able to compartmentalize our time better. But instagram doesn't have an app just for DMs - so you enter the main app and the first thing you see is the feed.
TODO: separate section about separating DMs from content & feeds - IDMs vs media - wellbeing? compartmentalization?
