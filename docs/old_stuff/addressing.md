# Content addressing

The move from host-centric to data-centric addressing is a complete paradigm shift by itself but Headjack intertwines that with names, on-chain authorization and sequencing of anchors resulting in the best possible [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) in terms of human-readability & persistence - perhaps the most important aspect of the project. This chapter is broken down into a few sub-chapters:

1. [Host vs data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md)
1. [Blobs & persistent URIs](blobs_and_uris.md)
1. [Names, paths, & more](names_and_paths.md)
