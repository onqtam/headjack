We are drowning in language, which is unbelievably complex and contains a lot of implied &amp; assumed meaning. Almost nothing is properly interlinked and there's a crisis of fragmentation, duplication &amp; lack of provenance. Data is hard to process &amp; aggregate unambiguously and we have reached the <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1622315719298883584">spamgularity</a> with the recent advancements in LLMs:</p>

<p>Information theory could be as important as or even fundamental to matter &amp; the laws of physics - they are tightly interwoven. Nature strives to remove every unnecessary bit when it comes to exchange of information - and so should we.</p>
<p>Let's take 2 sides of a debate around vaccines - Brett Weinstein &amp; Scott Adams. It is impossible for someone to quickly see where they've been on the debate throughout time without pouring hundreds of hours sifting through old tweets &amp; watching endless podcasts &amp; episodes. Their opinions should have been codified with structured data &amp; logged in a time-series.</p>
<p>Twitter &quot;extensions&quot; utilize text tweets and clutter the user experience
new message types!
extensions to twitter shouldn't clutter the comments like this:
@threadreaderapp unroll
@memdotai mem it
@readwise save

<p>REACTION with a comment/note - still structured data, but with added expressiveness</p>

<p>We need more than the current one size fits all model
Importance/severity threshold/levels?</p>
<p>Upsides in moving from language to structured data:</p>
<p>== If we moved the vast majority of online acitivity to structured data away from language we'd get:</p>
<ul>
<li>less need for translation &amp; localization</li>
<li>less need for content moderation</li>
<li>less emotionally manipulative language &amp; framing such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation">Russel conjugation</a></li>
<li>less need to think of the right words - reducing friction in expression</li>
</ul>
<p>unlike text, structured data is easily aggregatable for the purpose of visualization through graphs &amp; charts which makes it easily comprehensible</p>
<p>we should be able to use AI to determine the level of plagiarism between online posts and reduce the noise</p>
<p>Structured data should be incentivized</p>

<p>AI classification isn’t scalable enough and can be ambiguous</p>
<p>We’d be able to “view source” for the AI-generated summaries</p>
<p>We’d be able to query where else specific facts (semantic triples) are mentioned</p>
<p>A graph has many ways to be traversed so we could ask AIs to generate a few versions so that we can pick. Our we could draw a pathing for linguistic linearization</p>
<p>The generated linearized/serialized output could have an automatically generated mapping so that we can see which regions correspond to which parts of the graph with some highlighting and we could have both displayed side by side in a synchronized “playback”</p>
<p>People can have fine-grained control such as annotating specific nodes to be skipped from the serialization or to signal importance to them so that the AI adds more emphasis on them
Imagine integrating this in a movie-maker-like software with a timeline widget</p>
<p>We could compute the similarity of views if they were in such graph forms</p>
<p>We should be thinking in diagrams, graphs and state machines - mind mapping is superior for comprehension and retention of information compared to linearized text - we can augment/upgrade/automate our linguistics for the first time</p>
<p>the future of script writing is graph creation, where refactoring and shuffling things around is just a matter of moving around &amp; reconnecting subgraphs</p>
<p>Linearization/serialization of ideas in language inevitably loses details, precision and connections</p>
<p>The source should always be a graph because our minds represent knowledge and ideas as graphs - even though we communicate through serialization.</p>
<p>The only way for serialization to language to not lose any details, connections &amp; nuance in complex ideas is to be overly verbose and incomprehensible by humans.</p>
<p>the next version of tweets will be small graphs, accompanied by representations in a few media forms for different consumption options</p>
<p>language evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago - its about time we upgraded from it</p>
<p>the better we annotate content - the more discoverable it will be. People don't put #hashtags without a good reason - however they are extremely limited</p>
<p>we could (partially) pattern-match our thoughts</p>
<p>What if we could debug / fact-check the logic in our graph circuits - perhaps by checking specific assumptions around other external fact databases?</p>
<p>translating language to graphs of data is messy and hard - what if we first constructed our belief graphs &amp; thesis explicitly and then used AI to generate us presenting our version of the story in the most coherent way possible? What if we shifted creation to explicit node-based software first before anything else?
what leads to what, what the probabilities are.
just like writing forces us to think, the next level is constructing such graphs in forcing us to think
But until now we haven't had the option to turn such graphs into other types of consumable media
imagine how we can edit a graph and re-render the final media output to reflect that
we could even generate media that summarizes the changes of the graph throughout time - &quot;generate change report in X format&quot;</p>

<li>framing / frame control &amp; russell conjugation - what is vs how to feel about what is - this should be an anti signal
We should be less reliant on narratives and more on data</li>
</ul>
<p>what if we could annotate what's being said in text/video with semantic triplets and then being able to check those facts/assumptions against another database or set of facts by our choosing?</p>
<p>we can use AI to generate podcast-like conversations that cover the digital interactions of structured data</p>
<p>currently we channel our energy in a useless way - the best we can do is get a hashtag trending. But with this system every type of interaction would count</p>
<p>what if we enable communication through structured data and formal methods on top of it? What if we enable anyone to build any kind of sophisticated tool for formal modeling of the world around us?</p>
<p>so much expressed opinions &amp; views are left unanalyzed &amp; unaggregated because they're in text - they have an ephemeral impact for a moment and then fade</p>
<p>by increasing the amount of structured data we'd lower the amount of text that has to be checked for the rules - such as incitement of violence. Many freeform posts can be replaced by structured data</p>

<p><code>&quot;Pull that up Jamie&quot;</code> - we should be able to see all references &amp; content related to any identity, event/document or entity/concept/noun as a collection of comments, reactions/votes, annotations, redirections and edits/forks which we could organize &amp; filter through the UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Some YouTube videos have comments disabled. Why? Could be many reasons: <strong>1)</strong> perhaps they don't want to have their content associated with low quality comments, <strong>2)</strong> maybe they don't like the <a href="https://prnt.sc/ORguwjXfLgLR">scammers &amp; bots</a> and want to protect their audience, <strong>3)</strong> maybe they haven't fully thought this through, <strong>4)</strong> or maybe they are actively trying to hide something. But anything public can be discussed on other platforms (Reddit?) - all you've done is made it harder to find that discussion but it's still there (and is most likely fractured across different platforms/subreddits). The valid reasons (<strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>) can be negated with better tooling for content moderation - both for active participants (tagging, annotating, voting) &amp; the passive ones (simply consuming &amp; filtering through the UI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> What if we could provide alternative titles for content and crowdsource the ones which most accurately describe it - countering the clickbait? Users could choose to view the original titles or the crowdsourced versions if there's consensus for a specific title to be way better than the original. This is already happening in StackOverflow - titles of other people's posts can be edited by moderators (or anyone?) with the goal of improving accuracy. What constitutes &quot;better&quot; and which/how votes are counted can be configurable too. But wouldn't content creators object?! Sure, but what are they going to do? But data can be composed in any way imaginable in the Giant Global Graph. This is like taking the best comment about what a post/video should be titled and through something like a browser extension programatically using that instead of the original in the UI - you can't stop that. We could even calculate clickbait scores for content creators - I bet many would have more than 90% of their content re-titled according to some criteria. We could even feed such scores into recommendation algorithms - <strong>disincentivizing clickbait</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> The perpetual AMA (Ask Me Anything) - currently only a small handful of people have done <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA">AMAs in Reddit</a> that last only up to a few days with an extremely limiting interface in a sporadic/random fashion. What if every account had an implicit AMA associated with them (something like <a href="https://ask.fm">ask.fm</a> but a lot more powerful) and we could ask any leader/CEO/celebrity &amp; hyper agent questions with special message types and link them to their accounts? We could collectively surface the most pressing ones and make it glaringly obvious if the important ones aren't answered or if the answer is of poor quality - through different dashboards/charts &amp; sorting/filtering. We could hold them to higher standards &amp; more scrutiny. What if we could pressure companies &amp; CEOs about the use of Cobalt from African mines with slave labor? Doing a poll on <a href="https://change.org">change.org</a> is extremely ineffectual, but if something like it was integrated with a new more expressive type of social media for virality - it could have drastically different results. It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same interconnected identity &amp; data network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong> Reactions that relate to a piece of content. Let's take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPOcBVzm7s"><code>&quot;Jillian Michaels: Don't believe the keto diet hype | Big Think&quot;</code></a> video for example. How do we determine if what's in there true? All we have is a comment section and a sidebar with algorithmic recommendations. Turns out there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jillian+michaels+keto+reaction">a number of reactions</a> but they're not shown next to the video in any way - how would we know about their existence if we didn't explicitly search for them? The goal is not to be exposed to multiple points of view &amp; reach some conclusion - it's only engagement. The videos are not interlinked, but suppose they were - we could have a list of reactions displayed along with scores of disagreement and other factors and we could more easily discern which one to watch next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- The way to expose the complete failure & corruption of the FDA & their misguided policies is through a bottom-up crowdsourced effort enabled by the Internet and further enabled by linked data, identities & reputation. -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Example 5:</strong> 
Take the YouTube playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC9lvrBhVt4UUkhzpp3N5_x"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory | Computer Science | Khan Academy&quot;</code></a> for example. The videos are out of order, but someone has made another playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq2EDMGUqkHHjHLhp88RY-e5mN7uGMP75"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory (in order)&quot;</code></a> that is fixed. This is essentially a fork - one that is better than the original. Why can't we see a crowdsourced redirection suggestion attached to the original?</li>
</ul>
<p>A unified identity layer, the ability to deduplicate content, to annotate semantically &amp; the move to structured data greatly helps with being able to pull everything related to something. However, one concern is negative reputation &amp; &quot;scarlet letters&quot; - the ability to taint an entity and have the bad reputation follow it without the ability to hide it. But we can develop tools, norms &amp; criteria to evaluate/rank/filter any document &amp; reaction that relates to something. Moreover, even if there isn't a direct data connection between 2 entities (one referring to the other), as long as they are both public someone could index them and make that link. This problem already exists today.</p>

what if we could choose that the recommender AIs do not show us faces with artificial filters (annotated as such by others) - wouldn't that disincentivize the use of such filters?
Obviously this isn't thought through completely - it could turn out bad if the annotation isn't reliable - its just trying to illustrate a point.
we could use AI to detect this instead of human annotation &amp; reactions

<p>In Medium you can tweet a selection (sentence/word/paragraph) but when going back to the article from the tweet you don't get shown the original selection. With some archival services you can point to a text selection - for example <a href="https://archive.ph/O2D45#selection-635.4-635.18">this link has <code>&quot;Prussian Model&quot;</code></a> selected from the title when you open the page (<code>#selection-635.4-635.18</code>) and you can change the selection which also changes the URL, but that's possible only because there's a specific hash in the URL (<code>O2D45</code>) and the document is guaranteed not to change in the archive - however that's not the case with Medium where the authenticity of documents is host-certified and they can change in time.</p>
<p>With Headjack URIs point to a specific version of a document and as explained in the <a href="names_and_paths.html#addressing-within-content">addressing chapter</a> we could point to parts of documents in the URIs. If a document has been changed, updates will have their own new URIs and when an application is showing an old URI with intra-document addressing it could:</p>
<ul>
<li>either show a label that there's a newer version of the document and the user can switch</li>
<li>or directly show the new version if it's possible to transfer the selection without conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Headjack's intra-document addressing is universal - it works for audio &amp; video too and the application from the <a href="startup_case_study.html">startup case study</a> could display this clip with this quote in a much better way:</p>

<p>&quot;The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything&quot; - <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxphJhihcVY-U-PLFEvDl1m7Rb-iq4CGgo">@naval</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be pushed further - any composition/remix/meme of media could contain the references to the original text/pictures/audio/video so the sources of something can be traced and credited - imagine something like a movie maker that composes from other clips and all metadata is retained.</p>
