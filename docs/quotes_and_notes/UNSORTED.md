Control of resources should be proportional to contribution but the collective decides what % of that can be taken for personal consumption and the rest has to be redirected towards the collective as the individual that “earned” it best sees fit.

Problems with representative democracy
- nobody represents you perfectly
- No person can be competent in everything or good at delegating for everything
- Even if you find someone who represents you very well - someone exactly opposite to them could get elected and you get to have 0 say on anything - instead of at least having some influence on the weights
- Many issues never get raised simply because they are too niche

What if instead of some superficial twisted plot our thrillers revolved around communicating and displaying the top 100 most important concepts for society?

When debating an issue, one should not only mark that they’ve read the opposition’s points but they should be explicit about which points they concede and which they dont agree with. That way the unreasonable will stand out as absurd and the others will become more moderate and willing to take a different perspective

The 2 week unpaid vacation - how long you’d need to take off work to fully digest this and be part of changing the world

instead of making endless videos (or posts) commenting on events and requiring other people to watch them in order for your message to get across and have some influence - why not simply express your views in a structured, unambiguous, and aggregatable way such that this opinion of yours gets the full influence it deserves - based on your reputation?
People shouldn't have to watch and read everything from everyone to be informed - we need to separate signal from noise


how do we incentivise content creators to not simply rehash information and trying to "make it"  themselves but to actually point to the best current explanation for a topic - even if it is from someone else? Why do we reward them to rehash points from others?

instead of youtubers making the same "complete guide" video for each year with a few changes what if it was possible to map out somehow which aspects have changed between year X and Y? like a diff? what if viewing such content was interactive somehow?

If everything is open job interviews would be to simply fix something in the open

Mindedness does not refer to a substance but to a set of functional processes embedded in a particular structure." - [The Mind vs. Layers of Mindedness, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202401/the-mind-versus-layers-of-mindedness)

> "... life is properly conceived of as both a property and a generative process of complexification. Complexification refers to how things both differentiate and integrate to become “meta-stable” patterns that have causal properties. This means that life is a specific kind of assembled organization that enables particular behavior patterns. More specifically, life describes a set of complex adaptive units that process information (i.e., cells) and communicate with each other and create webs of behavioral complexification in various environmental contexts.
>
> To understand this better, we need to consider different levels of organization in nature. Lots of things are organized into hierarchical levels. One example is our language. It has letters, words, and sentences that can then be embedded into recursively complex systems (e.g., paragraphs, sections, chapters, books, topics)...
>
> Now, think of atoms as being akin to letters and molecules being like words. And then think of a generative process that gives rise to sentences. And then consider how these sentences can be stitched together and function as whole units that process information and communicate with each other. This is a reasonable way to think about the kind of thing life is. Genes are like the sentences, cells are like stories, and the ecology is like the topic or genre or context.
>
> This means that life is not a new force per se. Rather, life is a new plane of existence that emerged in the world as a function of novel information processing systems and communication networks that expanded into systems. Put in the metaphor of propositional language, life is the ecological network of chemical sentences that tell stories in the form of organisms like bacteria and oak trees...
>
> ... the mind, like life, is a plane of existence. This means that “the mind” is not some nonphysical force that causes physical things to behave. Rather, “mind” is properly framed as a property and a generative process that has given rise to a new plane of existence.

> ... Mindedness can be defined as the sensorimotor loop that emerged in the animal kingdom. Specifically, it starts as neuronal networks in things like sponges and jellyfish. It advances with the emergence of brains and bilateral body plans in things like planaria. Finally, there is the Cambrian Explosion. This is when we get animals with brains and complex active bodies that can engage in new kinds of patterns, like predation on other animals.
>
> The fundamental unit of life is the cell. The fundamental unit of “mind” is an animal with a brain and a complex active body. These two elements enable the animal to get up and move around as a whole, which, in turn, opens up a whole new way of being in the world (i.e., this is normally just labeled the world of animal behavior).

> Mindedness describes this property. And mental behaviors describe the kind of behaviors that exhibit mindedness. In so doing, the bridge between the behaviorists and the mentalists is made clear.

> "The BUC(k)ET Model of Core Social Motives: The five motives are belonging, understanding, control, enhance self, and trust.
>
> • The BUC(k)ET model provides a frame for understanding the situations people thrive in versus flounder.
>
> • We do well when we have a deep sense of belonging and trust the institutions and experts that lead us.
>
> • We thrive when we can feel good about ourselves and have avenues for personal growth and improvement.
>
> ... Susan Fiske is a major figure in the field [social psychology] who developed the core social motive approach to social psychology. Based on much empirical research, it identifies five core motives that can be organized in the acronym BUC(k)ET as follows: Belonging, Understanding, Control, Enhance self, Trust others. This post summarizes these core motives and shows how we might use the framework to understand human social dynamics.
>
> • **Belonging**: Do you feel loved and cared for by your family? Are you accepted and admired by your peers? Do you feel pride in the institutions you take part in? All of these relate to the concept of belonging. Another key aspect of belonging pertains to conformity and the way that people tend to follow the expectations, norms, and trends of a group.
>
> • **Understanding**: Have you ever felt frustrated because you were confused and just could not make sense of a situation or of how you were treated? Maybe a romantic partner left you but gave no reason. Or maybe you were given a task you should be able to solve but could not. Or maybe you were even watching a Netflix show that you felt just did not make any sense. All of these negative reactions can be framed by the core motive to understand. Humans are meaning-making creatures that have a strong drive to make sense of their world, share that with others, and have their expectations met. When people lose a sense that the world makes sense and can be predicted, then they feel alienated and frustrated and are motivated to develop new mental models or leave the situation and seek more familiar territory.
>
> • **Control**: Controlling the flow of resources is crucial to survival and reproductive success. In addition, demonstrating control in social situations is suggestive of someone who has power and can be effective at achieving one’s goals. We can see the motive to control when we flip it and consider how people feel when they feel helpless, incompetent, and inferior.
>
> • **Enhancing self**: Human beings have significant capacities for self-reflection, and there is much research that people are motivated to think of themselves in as positive light as they can justify. Put differently, it is painful to think of one’s self as weak, foolish, or lesser than other people. In contrast, people feel good about themselves when they have a sense they are growing, improving, and contributing to the world in a positive way. One way the self-enhancement motive shows up is via self-serving biases. Consider, for example, when things go wrong that they are responsible for, people tend to blame others or bad luck or temporary factors that can be changed; however, when things go right, the reason is because the person is a good, competent individual.
>
> • **Trust**: If everyone lied and no one could be trusted to follow through on anything, society would quickly break down. By framing it in the negative, we can highlight how important trust is for human group relations. As such, it is not surprising that people seek environments where they feel like they can trust in others and be trusted themselves. This shows up in the sense that the group they are a part of is honest, predictable, and will treat them justly, and it shows up in how they trust the ingroup experts that lead their group.
>
> What are the situations people thrive in? Conversely, when are people floundering and distressed? The BUC(k)ET framework helps us understand the kind of social relations humans seek and what kinds of environments they will tend to flourish in. It says people do well when they have a deep sense of belonging and trust the institutions and experts that lead them, when they feel like they understand the world and can generate shared meaning-making with important others, when they feel like they can control the flow of resources, and when they can feel good about themselves and have avenues for personal growth and improvement. We can flip this around and look at modern times and see that, at a societal level, we are experiencing many holes in our BUC(k)ET... People’s trust in institutions is at an all-time low. Our national identity is fractured, and tensions between groups are high. We are facing a meaning crisis, and are so overloaded with information and change that understanding is very hard. And our lifestyles are in such a state of flux that a sense of control and stable personal growth are difficult to achieve. Perhaps we can use the BUC(k)ET framework to consider the kinds of changes we need to make to get things moving in a better direction." - [The BUC(k)ET Model of Core Social Motives, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202402/the-bucket-model-of-core-social-motives)

> "... the core cognitive process in animals is functionally organized by recursive relevance realization, and ... the domain of Mind2 (subjective conscious experience) is a model of mindedness constituted by focal recursive relevance realization that affords the animal perspectival knowing across time.

> ... mindedness evolved in animals to coordinate behavioral investment patterns over extended time horizons (i.e., from reflexes and procedural instincts to operant learning to imagined simulations from a subjective point of view to narrating reasons via propositional knowing in humans), which provides a framework to understand the evolution of Mind2 from elementary feelings to a subjective perspective on the world.

Top-down elements include things like directing your attention and the schema (i.e., maps or models) that one has for perceiving the world. The fact that you decided to shift your attention and look around is an example of top-down processes.
>
> Bottom-up elements refer to the input data that is coming in through the senses. Have you ever been frightened by an unexpectedly loud “bang”? An unexpected large shift in sound is a bottom-up signal that grabs your attention. Before you are even conscious of hearing anything, your body will already have started to react, orienting toward the sound and adopting a defensive stance. This is called the “acoustic startle response,” and it is a built-in reflex. Our bottom-up sensory systems also learn to become sensitized or habituated to elements over time, depending on our drives and the experiences that we have.

> ... To live life well, it is crucial that, overall, what is salient in your attentional landscape is relevant to how you want to live your life. This is a crucial point for living well in the modern world because you are constantly being bombarded by many things, including advertisements and other “click bait” designed to be salient and grab your attention, but which are not relevant for wise living.
>
> ... The goal of advertising is to grab your attention via bottom-up means. And often the best way to do that is via bottom-up salience signals. Why do you think sex sells? It brings attention to the product and makes subconscious associations, even if they are not actually relevant.

> "The self emerges as animals model themselves across time and in relationships. The human self consists of a nonverbal experiential self, a narrating ego, and a persona that manages impressions...
>
> A New Model for Framing the Self
>
> ... perhaps as early as the Cambrian Explosion some 520 million years ago, there was an integration in the brain of sensory inputs with inner drives that functioned to generate “valence qualia,” which are bodily feeling states like pleasure and pain that guide animals toward and away from valued stimuli. Then, as animals advanced in their capacity to model the environment and their anticipated outcomes, and deliberate based on possible action sequences, a more extended form of subjective consciousness emerged, something we might call “an inner mind’s eye” that arises in a global neuronal workspace... this inner mind’s eye can be effectively divided into a witness function that frames and indexes specific aspects of attention with a hereness-nowness-togetherness binding that can be called “adverbial qualia,” and the contents of that frame, such as the redness of an apple, which can be called “adjectival qualia.”
>
> A Need to Model the Self Across Time
>
> ... coordinating agent-arena actions require models of both the agent and arena and their dynamic relation...
>
> If this fact is coupled to the idea that higher forms of cognition and consciousness allow animals to extend themselves across time and situations, we move from modeling the immediate agent-arena relationship to modeling the agent across many separate arenas that are extended in time. For example, a rat at a choice point in a maze will project itself down the right arm of the maze, and then down the left arm. Crucially, although the rat’s simulation of the two paths will be different, the deliberation requires a consistent model of the self (i.e., the rat is the same, whereas the paths are what differ). This insight gives rise to the claim that as animals engage in deliberation across time, a model of the self that is distinct from the many possible environments is required. The point here is that the jump in cognition and consciousness that allows animals to extend themselves across time also points to the need for a more elaborate model of the self.
>
> Modeling the Self in Relation to Others
>
> ... a second crucial jump would occur as animals became increasingly intertwined in relationships with others...
>
> This process of modeling self-in-relation-to-other is framed by Vervaeke by adding “relational” to recursive relevance realization. That is, it is the self-other feedback loop that should be tracked for relevant information. This formulation is directly aligned with Henriques’ Influence Matrix, which maps the process dimensions of the human primate relationship system. Specifically, it suggests that humans intuitively track processes of exchange for indications of having social influence or being valued by others, as well as implications for power/competition, love/affiliation, and levels of dependency or independence.
>
> Consistent with work from Tomasello, humans have particularly strong capacities among the great apes to track others' perspectives and feelings, and develop a shared attention and intention. Tomasello calls this the intersubjective “we” space that can form as humans sync up with others. Following the logic above, this suggests massive mapping of self across time in relationship to many others and in many contexts. The result is a dynamic picture of the human primate, pre-verbal self that is very consistent with both James’ assertion that the self is a function of the other and Baumeister’s claim that there is a felt sense of unity." - [A New Integrative Model of the Self, by Gregg Henriques, John Vervaeke & Christopher Mastropietro](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202109/a-new-integrative-model-of-the-self)

> One example of this is prediction markets: you want to know a specific fact that will take place in the future, and so you set up a market for people to bet on that fact. Another example is decision markets: you want to know whether decision A or decision B will produce a better outcome according to some metric M. To achieve this, you set up conditional markets: you ask people to bet on (i) which decision will be chosen, (ii) value of M if decision A is chosen, otherwise zero, (iii) value of M if decision B is chosen, otherwise zero. Given these three variables, you can figure out if the market thinks decision A or decision B is more bullish for the value of M.

> ... Info finance for distilled human judgement
>
> Suppose that you have a human judgement mechanism that you trust, and that has the [legitimacy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) of a whole community trusting it, but which takes a long time and a high cost to make a judgement. However, you want access to at least an approximate copy of that "costly mechanism" cheaply and in real time. Here is [Robin Hanson's idea](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/meta-jury-markets) for what you can do: every time you need to make a decision, you set up a prediction market on what outcome the costly mechanism would make on the decision if it was called. You let the prediction market run, and put in a small amount of money to [subsidize market makers](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GxmfqKjs6ruxNxhqr/prediction-markets-explained#Subsidizing_Liquidity).
>
> 99.99% of the time, you don't actually call the costly mechanism: perhaps you "revert the trades" and give everyone back what they put in, or you just give everyone zero, or you see if the average price was closer to 0 or 1 and treat that as the ground truth. 0.01% of the time - perhaps randomly, perhaps for the highest-volume markets, perhaps some combination of both - you actually run the costly mechanism, and compensate participants based on that.
>
> This gives you a [credibly neutral](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/) fast and cheap "distilled version" of your original highly trustworthy but highly costly mechanism (using the word "distilled" as an analogy to [LLM distillation](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/distillation-llm)). Over time, this distilled mechanism roughly mirrors the original mechanism's behavior - because only the participants that help it have that outcome make money, and the others lose money.
>
> This has applications not just in social media, but also for DAOs. A major problem of DAOs is that there is such a large number of decisions that most people are not willing to participate in most of them, leading to either widespread use of delegation, with risk of the same kinds of centralization and principal-agent failures we see in representative democracy, or vulnerability to attack. A DAO where actual votes only happen very rarely, and most things are decided by prediction markets with some combination of humans and AI predicting the votes, could work well.
>
> Just as we saw in the decision markets example, info finance contains many potential paths to solving important problems in decentralized governance.

Human intent stems from a complex blend of motivations, desires, and values, but it rarely includes all relevant factors for the long-term thriving of life as we know it. Our intent, even when it is well-meaning, is caught in multipolar traps and laden with misconceptions, incomplete knowledge and a range of psychological issues, all of which inevitably leads to bad outcomes for everyone. It is hard to look at the range and scale of historical atrocities and assert that humanity has ever been a good steward of power. With exponentially more power, exponential externalities and exponential conflict will either break the finite limits of our shared biosphere or deliver dystopias of ubiquitous surveillance and control to avoid such an outcome.
>
> Observing this dynamic, some have noted that this fundamental feature of our world system—which may be summarized as collective activities leading to worse outcomes for all—acts seemingly as an agent, independent of any individual control. Naming the agent is helpful in identifying the phenomena; it allows the human mind to conceptualize something far exceeding the typical scale of our imagination. **Moloch can be personified as that which drives human actions and fails to take into account wider impacts; that which defines success too narrowly, and that which leads in the end to negative outcomes, for all.**
>
> The nature of the mind that makes a great marketer, politician, financier, or military general are also the result of—and servant to—Moloch. To a certain extent, the same may also be said for the nature of the mind that makes a great engineer or technologist or lawmaker. To succeed in any of these domains often necessitates the externalizing of costs, narrow goals pursued at the expense of more holistically beneficial outcomes, and the sacrifice of other values in service of winning.

> The world is full of elite universities, visionary companies, and powerful governments; it is full of outstanding scientific specialists in every domain, including Nobel Prize winners, and planetary-scale industrialists and operators; it is full of groups and institutions with highly developed processes for efficiency, effectiveness, scaling, and goal-achieving, including processes for measurement, testing and refining, and for optimizing returns on essential metrics. The world operates with strong incentives to innovate and create new solutions. Not only in spite of this system, but because of it, we have a world in metacrisis, which is rapidly deteriorating, and in which every new innovation and scaled solution brings us closer to the brink of annihilation.

> Our Success Is Our Problem

> To every corner of the world, we have successfully scaled satellites and cell phones, gasoline and automobiles, electricity and appliances, processed sugar and disposable plastics, money and modern cultural desires. The capacity to achieve these goals is incredible. In fact, we are particularly good at these types of things—so good that we are unable to stop. Our current world system—which may be defined as the maximum power-seeking cybernetic machine—is on autopilot towards all possible types of growth (including removing anything that opposes it), on a path to its own self-destruction.
>
> The success of this system is the cause of the metacrisis; there would be no metacrisis without incredible science, technological innovation, scaling, and social engineering. Low-tech societies and tribal groups couldn’t do much harm even if they wanted to. The minds that succeed in this world do so both because they can succeed on these terms and because they are motivated to do so. The more successful any given person has been in this world, the more their intuitions and processes for change-making will simply add to the metacrisis—even if they are trying to solve problems. It is these successful and sometimes well-intentioned people who will have the hardest time recognizing this dynamic. They will also have the fewest points of reference for the kind of mind necessary to conceive of truly adequate solutions. In general, these successful people will have the hardest time reconditioning their minds—their identities, how they see the world, how they think, what they value, what they pay attention to, what they notice, what they feel, what they are motivated by, what they are frustrated by, what they listen to, how they make sense of the world, how they relate to knowing—to become the kind of mind that does not unwittingly continue to drive the metacrisis.
>
> **The nature of the minds needed to change humanity’s trajectory are not conditioned by this system**—this system does not produce them inherently, and in fact suppresses their success and adds barriers to their acquisition of power and influence. The nature of mind of the most successful people in this world is a product of the system that their choices and actions perpetuate; its processes make sense and feel native to them, and as a result they cannot help but create more of the same.

> Scientific research that does not have immediate market value does not get much funding. Cures for diseases that are not patentable (and thus not profitable) are not studied, and only synthetic chemicals that are not inherently part of nature (or health) receive research attention. Similarly, war and weapons development receives millions of times more investment than peace research.

> Every vertical aspect of civilization (i.e. material and operational sectors such as agriculture, medicine, materials acquisition, manufacturing, waste management, communications, energy production, military, etc.), and every horizontal aspect (i.e. cross-cutting functions that are relevant to all verticals, such as science, education, research and development, law-making, politics, financing, etc.) all developed in service to Moloch. All sectors and enabling frameworks of civilization are caught in multipolar traps and defined by narrow goal-achieving; if they were not, they would not exist as they do now—they would not have made it through. There is no domain of human activity in which power is not involved, no domains of process or best practice, and no disciplines of thinking or acting, that are not shaped by and ultimately oriented in the direction of Moloch and therefore the metacrisis. Underlying everything is the conditioning of the mind: the identity, motivations, processes of thinking, and most fundamentally, the conditioning of perception.
>
> The Mind Conditioned
>
> The kind of mind that—to a significant extent—now runs the world is unable to adequately imagine a world in harmony. All it sees are games to win and paths to dominance. This kind of mind… is conditioned not to notice most of reality (and remains unaware of the lack of noticing), is conditioned to see the world as composed of separate things, apply words to these things as labels, attach fixed data and concepts to them, and call that knowledge, is conditioned to focus on things in terms of their relevance and utility to personal goals, wants to reduce the infinite complexity of reality to models and measurements, wants to feel agentic and empowered before having gained a meaningful depth of understanding of the fundamental complexity of reality, always seeks a path to more control, avoids feeling the pain of the world fully, bypasses the suffering (and its lessons), and rushes instead to “fix” it, finds uncertainty unbearable and cannot rest in a state of unknowing, cannot trust unless it can understand, does not actively seek to feel what it’s like to be another, and factor their experiences into a deeper understanding of the world and their place within it, is not continuously humbled in awe at the incomprehensibility of reality, was conditioned by the current world system in order to perpetuate it. This kind of mind cannot accurately perceive how nature designs, and cannot notice its own blind spots—filled as they are with the generative dynamics of the metacrisis. This kind of mind cannot help but create more of the types of patterns by which it was conditioned.
>
> **The Future**
>
> Most of the dynamics that make the world’s core issues so intractable are rapidly accelerating in their scale of impact and complexity. Radical asymmetries of power are increasing exponentially. In fact, exponential functions define all of the most important features of our path into the future—in particular the speed, unpredictability, uncontrollability, and complexity of the issues, as well as the rate of change of critical factors. At the same time, the processes necessary to effect real change are mostly eroding: public sensemaking, political effectiveness, integrity of the legal system, civic virtue, the mental and physical health of the public, and more. The processes driving this erosion (including, for example, the impact of powerful technologies on epistemics and the information commons) are also becoming increasingly difficult to address or mitigate. The scale of impending issues (and their compounding nature) is also radically outpacing our preparedness.

> There is a wide range of natural responses to a frank and honest assessment of the issues outlined in this document. Many such reactions may be observed across human cultures and societies now. Around the world, an increasing number of people are either turning to strong-man leaders, false messiahs, terrorist ideologies, or simply addiction, distraction, and nihilism. Some typical false messiahs that are increasingly common in the Western zeitgeist include, for example: doubling down on free markets and techno-optimism, “American exceptionalism will get us through,” “aliens will save us,” and “free energy will solve all problems” (among many others). Perhaps the most common retreat is toward comforting but ungrounded positive narratives. In the case of the most informed and powerful people, nearly all have doubled down on the race to technological supremacy, while at the same time spending billions on [underground survival complexes](https://theweek.com/wealth/1025278/inside-the-billionaire-business-plan-for-the-apocalypse).

> The trend of deterioration may be observed across almost all of the most foundational aspects of mind and collective social psychologies. This includes the fragmented worldviews, the lack of holistic perspectives, and the perverse motivations at the heart of all great problems. Dark triad traits are increasingly prevalent, particularly in positions of power. Historically, humanity has relied on a set of processes to temper egoic motivations, including true religious belief and practice, civic virtue, close-knit communities, formal periods of reflective silence, time in nature, time with children and older people, the witnessing of births and deaths, deep mentorship, and service work. These social restraints on egoic motivation have mostly eroded. The scale of unfulfilled promises and virtue-signaling from positions of power—as well as the starkness of world trends and the associated lack of positive vision and agency—have left many caring people jaded.

> One commonly expressed hope is that the lived experience of a crisis will act as a system shock and a catalyst for subsequent change. Unfortunately, our track record in this regard also provides scant evidence in support of this position. Change could have occurred as a result of 9/11, but it didn’t. It could have occurred after the war in Iraq and the revelation of the lack of weapons of mass destruction and the deaths of many innocent civilians—but it didn’t. It also didn’t happen as a result of the financial crisis, or COVID, or any of the school and mass shootings, or the social upheaval rooted in events connected to George Floyd and January 6, 2021. None of these previously unimaginable issues triggered the kind of “emergence through emergency” that many hope will come to our rescue. This reality must be factored into our hopes for the future.

> Given the range, scale, and immediacy of the issues currently facing humanity, the most likely outcomes involve futures of a profoundly undesirable type. Clear and executable strategies to address the metacrisis are hard even to imagine. This reality is demonstrated by the lack of any coherently articulated plan from governments, businesses, non-profits, academies, militaries, think tanks, religions, and other institutions. Most of our great problems are the result of our attempts to solve other, pre-existing problems, and the same pattern defines our attempts to design solutions to facets of our current problem landscape. Most of these solutions actually accelerate the timelines to irreversibility of the very issues they seek to address.

> The world has a vast number of extraordinarily smart, capable, and good people, all working earnestly on issues that they consider to be important. The current state of the world is not explained by a lack of these qualities. At the same time, it is important to remain aware that adequate solutions are unlikely to be easily forthcoming, given the context provided above.

Considering the role of premature agency and insufficient humility in the cause of our current state of affairs, it is worth simply sitting with the complexity and the emotion, allowing the weight of uncertainty to be felt; only then is it really worth asking what may be done in response. If the assessment presented here is accurate—or even just directionally true—what does it mean? What is the significance? If you, reader, were to hold this assessment as accurate, how would you respond? Relative to the depth of your care and commitment to find a way to act increasingly effectively, how would you act in service to that care?

This discrepancy is common in public life, where people are frequently impelled — whether by their own propensities or by the demands of others — to speak extensively about matters of which they are to some degree ignorant. Closely related instances arise from the widespread conviction that it is the responsibility of a citizen in a democracy to have opinions about everything, or at least everything that pertains to the conduct of his country’s affairs. The lack of any significant connection between a person’s opinions and his apprehension of reality will be even more severe, needless to say, for someone who believes it his responsibility, as a conscientious moral agent, to evaluate events and conditions in all parts of the world." - [Harry G.

Now it is human nature that is scraped, torn, and taken for another century’s market project. It is obscene to suppose that this harm can be reduced to the obvious fact that users receive no fee for the raw material they supply. That critique is a feat of misdirection that would use a pricing mechanism to institutionalize and therefore legitimate the extraction of human behavior for manufacturing and sale. It ignores the key point that the essence of the exploitation here is the rendering of our lives as behavioral data for the sake of others’ improved control of us.

== NOTES FROM THIS YOUTUBE LECTURE: Bart Vanderhaegen - Creating open management systems in companies
Karl Popper's criterium for good political systems: instead of asking "Who should rule?" we should be asking "How to set things up so that bad rulers and bad policies can be removed without violence?"
In management: from "Who should get the job?" to "How to set things up so that bad ideas and be removed & improved without increased disengagement?"
Or stated differently: "How to create an open management system with open ended knowledge creation and increasing engagement?"
The ultimate question/criterium for management methods: "Is it entrenching errors or is it providing the means to correct errors?"




> "If the trends of complexity growth and technological progress continue over the course of this century, and the inevitability of life spreading through the cosmos becomes increasingly apparent to us, then I believe this new cosmic narrative will become the world’s reigning “religion,” as science will have shown that an existential philosophy of meaning, purpose, and morality is the correct one. The evolutionary process would have a moral arc, where conscious agents become increasingly spiritual and empathetic as they gain a more sophisticated “theory of mind.” That is, the more we become aware that other agents, human and otherwise, are conscious entities with the capacity for joy and suffering, the more we will care about those agents. The “golden rule” is emergent from a theory of mind and our mirror neuron system. We should treat others as we want to be treated, because such behavior increases the chances that we will be treated well. Morality and utility go hand in hand." - [Waking Up the Universe: A Teleological Vision for a Meta-Religion, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/waking-up-the-universe-a-teleological#:~:text=If%20the%20trends,hand%20in%20hand.)

> "The idea of a compatibility between human agency or free will and cosmic destiny is a Christian doctrine that seemed paradoxical, though the self-organizing universe paradigm supports it and makes scientific sense of it. Since I have a 3500-word article to be published by Noema on May 21st, I will just explain the basic premise of the idea. With intrinsic uncertainty and randomness in nature, both at the quantum level and now it seems at the classical level in chaotic phenomena (see the recent work of physicist Nicholas Gisin), combined with the notion of top-down causation that explains how organisms with minds can have causal power in the world, we get a paradox-free mechanism for agency or “will.” With humans’ ability to imagine multiple future possibilities and select a choice from the menu of options based on their values and goals, we have free will in every meaningful sense of the term. At the same time, the self-organizing universe is one that evolves toward a predetermined state of maximal complexity, giving rise to a type of “global determinism” that allows for randomness and volition within that deterministic trajectory. This compatibility between free will and cosmic destiny is fascinating and spiritually satisfying." - [Waking Up the Universe: A Teleological Vision for a Meta-Religion, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/waking-up-the-universe-a-teleological#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20a,fascinating%20and%20spiritually%20satisfying.)

> "When we are trying to understand the nature of a multiply realizable phenomenon, the “true” description of that phenomenon is not to be found at any single level—the deepest understanding would come from recognizing the common abstraction that can be extracted from the different levels. For example, we can understand how a biosphere functions as a self-regulating complex adaptive system by seeing its similarities with biological organisms. This property of nature is known as [self-similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity), and mathematicians have studied it using abstract methods such as [reflection principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_principle). These ideas are somewhat obscure at the current time, and there is likely much to gain by applying them to the study of complex adaptive systems, like cells and cities, which have similar dynamics and organization, despite existing on massively different scales (see Geoffrey West’s book [Scale: The Universal Laws of Growth, Innovation, Sustainability, and the Pace of Life in Organisms, Cities, Economies, and Companies](https://www.amazon.com/Scale-Universal-Innovation-Sustainability-Organisms/dp/1594205582)).
>
> Self-similarity in the biological world suggests that the levels in a nested complex adaptive system can inform each other by revealing dynamics and mechanisms that might be hard to observe, for whatever reason, at some other level. For example, the dynamics of ecosystems might tell us something about the dynamics of autocatalytic sets, and vice versa. One might also assume that learning about the dynamics of a complex adaptive system at one level in the hierarchy of life might tell us something about the levels that have not yet emerged but are to be expected. For example, studying how consciousness emerges in human brains could tell us something about how consciousness might emerge in the global brain that is being formed by humans connected by their online devices. In this way, Poetic Meta-Naturalism has predictive power that no reductionist theory has. Rather than ignoring emergent phenomena, it uses them to predict the behavior of isomorphic patterns at various scales of size.
>
> Perhaps the most interesting thing about Poetic Meta-Naturalism is that it is a theory that is “self-aware,” in the sense that it refers to itself. Because it describes emergent phenomena, and paradigms are also emergent phenomena, the theory becomes aware of its role in the evolutionary process, as well as its own limitations.
>
> Specifically, Poetic Meta-Naturalism predicts that its model of the reality will have errors, and it gives instructions for how it is supposed to be updated when new evidence comes in (using Bayes’ theorem). It is also by definition an incomplete theory, as it acknowledges that new phenomena with novel properties will inevitably emerge in the future, requiring that the framework be expanded." - [Poetic Meta-Naturalism: A New Philosophy of Reality for the Metamodern Age, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/poetic-meta-naturalism-a-new-philosophy#:~:text=When%20we%20are,framework%20be%20expanded.)

> "The best way to understand religion is to view it as the product of collective human inference. In other words, religious explanations were our ancestors' best attempt at constructing meaningful answers to practical and existential questions, given the knowledge available at the time. By using metaphors and stories, they provided an intuitive and memorable sense-making lens before we had the method of science or rational analysis. In addition to its sense-making function, another adaptive feature was that it offered an ethical system that maximized the chances of collective survival. Religion still flourishes today because of these qualities, which a nihilistic worldview cannot provide.
>
> The story of the self-organizing universe is a new scientific paradigm that moves us away from nihilism, towards an empirical worldview that has many of the same qualities as religions. Exploring this story inevitably leads to a convergence of complexity theory and spiritual philosophy, providing a natural bridge between science and religion. The goal of this article is to use this new paradigm to construct a coherent meta-narrative — a story of stories — that illuminates the causal structure of reality, or “how the world works,” while honoring both the rigorous empiricism of science and the profound philosophical insights of our spiritual traditions. This grand meta-narrative may be called the Meta-Religion, because it is an attempt to create a cosmic religion from all the religious concepts that are consistent with the story of a self-organizing, self-actualizing cosmos.
>
> By discovering philosophical and religious concepts that align with the story of recursive emergence, we are identifying universal truths that span both scientific and spiritual understandings of reality. Where scientific explanations tell us about the nature of reality, spiritual explanations reveal something about our relationship to that reality — our connection to something larger than ourselves. The surprising parallels in humanity's attempts to explain existence across diverse cultures and eras point to an objective structure of reality that can be intuited by deep thought and reflection.
>
> Though there is another practical reason for this ambitious academic exercise, beyond deepening our understanding of our reality. By constructing such a synthesis, we open the door to a universal perspective, potentially fostering unity and mutual understanding across diverse cultures. Rather than dismissing millennia of spiritual insights, we can harness the paradigm of cosmic self-organization to weave thousands of years of philosophical and religious thought into a unifying worldview that instills life with meaning and purpose. This approach offers something akin to the "cosmic religion" envisioned by science advocates like Albert Einstein and Carl Sagan. For instance, Sagan wrote:
>
> “A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later such a religion will emerge.”
>
> Einstein, a self-proclaimed pantheist in the vein of Spinoza, saw God in the orderly dynamics of nature. His assertion that "Religion without science is blind; science without religion is lame" clearly reveals his belief in the potential synergy between scientific understanding and spiritual perspective.
>
> In fact, most of the greatest scientists and mathematicians from history were simultaneously rational-minded and religious, in some sense or another. For example, intellectual giants such as Isaac Newton, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, Sir Arthur Eddington, Max Planck, Werner Heisenberg, and Kurt Godel, all identified as Christian, though I imagine these men were the type of Christian who saw the Bible as a collection of useful metaphors and timeless truths rather than literal accounts of supernatural events. The point is that they considered themselves to be spiritual and saw meaning in life and nature, to the point where they felt like some kind of religious practice was worth their time.
>
> While many great scientists found inspiration in Western religious traditions, others were drawn to the profound insights of Eastern philosophies, demonstrating that the search for meaning and understanding transcends cultural boundaries. For example, Erwin Schrödinger, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, was profoundly intrigued by the insights of Hindu philosophy. He was particularly fascinated by the concept of "unity consciousness," which posits that all individual consciousnesses are ultimately part of a single, universal consciousness — a concept that resonated with his understanding of an interconnected quantum reality. Werner Heisenberg, another pioneer of quantum physics, also saw scientific truth in Eastern religion, both in Hindu philosophy and in the Chinese concept of yin and yang, which he related to his principle of complementarity in quantum mechanics. Other physicists of the time, such as Niels Bohr and Wolfgang Pauli, had similar interests in Eastern religion. All these thinkers were pioneers of the weird world of quantum physics, which suggests that at the frontiers of scientific inquiry, we may find unexpected bridges to ancient wisdoms that were previously deemed irrelevant. The recursive emergence paradigm offers many such bridges." - [Constructing the Meta-Religion: Mapping Concepts from Eastern and Western Religion onto the Story of a Self-Organizing Universe, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/constructing-the-meta-religion-mapping#:~:text=The%20best%20way,many%20such%20bridges.)

> "At the heart of cosmic evolution lies a dynamic interplay of opposing forces that culminates in emergent phenomena — in other words, a dialectic that drives the universe towards ever-increasing complexity. Think of a dialectic as a dialogue between two opposing sides that ultimately leads to a new synthesis. There are dialectical processes going on all throughout nature and culture, but the most fundamental dialectic is the interaction of nature’s two main opposing tendencies: the tendency toward order and the tendency toward disorder. The tendency toward order is known as spontaneous self-organization, and it creates dynamical systems capable of evolution. The tendency for those organized systems to move towards disorder and decay is the dynamic associated with the second law of thermodynamics, which produces entropy.
>
> The dialectical process manifests itself throughout the natural world, driving evolution at every scale of existence. At the level of the individual organism, the interplay between order and disorder inside a complex adaptive system creates a delicate balance point that complexity theorists call "the edge of chaos." It is at this critical juncture that living systems are able to evolve and adapt optimally. Too much order leads to stagnation and rigidity, while too much disorder or chaos results in dissolution and collapse. It is in the dynamic tension between these extremes that life flourishes.
>
> At the level of populations of organisms, we observe the dialectical dynamic in the Darwinian mechanism of evolution. Here, the generative force of reproduction with genetic variation produces a diversity of life forms, and then that variety is pruned by the destruction of the less resilient lifeforms, a process known as natural selection. As a result, biological designs are continually being refined and optimized. This represents the concept of “survival of the fittest,” which is associated with competition between organisms.
>
> Moving up the scale of complexity, we encounter the dialectical interplay between competition and cooperation in the evolution of species and the formation of animal societies. Competition drives the evolution of the individual toward the most adaptable and resilient form, while cooperation enables the individuals to form complex social structures like communities, corporations, and countries. The tension between these opposing forces leads to a balance that optimizes both individual and group fitness.
>
> In the realm of culture, the dialectical dynamic drives the evolution of ideas, theories, and worldviews. In Hegel’s famous framework, an initial idea (the thesis) inevitably gives rise to its opposite (the antithesis). Competing ideas or paradigms then collide, often resulting in periods of social upheaval. However, from this conflict and tension between opposites a synthesis emerges, which incorporates elements of both the thesis and antithesis while transcending their opposition. Once firmly established, this synthesis then becomes the thesis in a new cycle of the three-pronged dialectical process (thesis > antithesis > synthesis), which continues in an iterative fashion. This intellectual dialectic drives the continuous refinement of human knowledge, leading to ever more complex and sophisticated ideas, social systems, and technologies.
>
> Taoism elegantly represents this dialectical dynamic through the iconic yin and yang. These complementary forces — which can represent order and chaos, stability and change, or knowledge and uncertainty — engage in a synergistic dance that creates a unified whole which is more than the sum of its parts. This dialectical interplay facilitates the flow of qi (pronounced “chi”), a movement of energy that brings about transformation, which is a manifestation of the Tao. We can reinterpret the Tao as representing the telos of nature (its inherent drive toward complexity), and the flow of qi as the thermodynamic engine of cosmic self-organization, propelling the universe toward a more functional state." - [Constructing the Meta-Religion: Mapping Concepts from Eastern and Western Religion onto the Story of a Self-Organizing Universe, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/constructing-the-meta-religion-mapping#:~:text=At%20the%20heart%20of%20cosmic,toward%20a%20more%20functional%20state.)

> "Whether expressed through mystical symbolism or scientific models, the idea of a self-balancing, dynamically stable universe that continually evolves and complexifies through a dialectical dynamic presents itself to us. The ubiquity of dialectical thinking across diverse traditions, and the parallels between ancient wisdom and the emerging narrative of cosmic self-organization, suggests that science, philosophy, and religion are all one great big human project, representing a process of collective sense-making that is gradually uncovering the true nature of reality." - [Constructing the Meta-Religion: Mapping Concepts from Eastern and Western Religion onto the Story of a Self-Organizing Universe, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/constructing-the-meta-religion-mapping#:~:text=Whether%20expressed%20through,nature%20of%20reality.)

> "To me, the most mind-blowing aspect of this majestic cosmic story is that humanity is poised to play a crucial role. As self-aware expressions of the universe, we are not mere spectators but active participants in the process of cosmic self-organization. It is particularly intriguing that collectively gaining a conscious awareness of our role in the process of cosmic evolution represents a pivotal point in the process — it is when the universe becomes aware of itself and begins to consciously direct its own development.
>
> This realization brings with it a profound responsibility, echoed in concepts like the Jewish notion of Tikkun Olam — the duty to "repair the world" and contribute to the gradual healing and perfection of creation. There is also the Hindu and Sikh concept of Sewa, or service for others without expecting anything in return. We are called to be co-creators in the creative evolution process, using our intelligence and creativity to guide the development of life and consciousness on Earth and potentially beyond. That requires compassion and a coming together. The process simply cannot continue independent of self-aware beings with agency and free choice.
>
> This perspective offers a powerful framework for understanding our place in the cosmos and our role in its ongoing evolution. It suggests that our individual and collective efforts to increase knowledge and cultivate connection are not isolated endeavors, but integral parts of a vast cosmic process. As we continue to develop technologies and worldviews that enhance our collective intelligence and global connectivity, we are laying the groundwork for the next great leap in cosmic evolution — the emergence of a coherent planetary-scale intelligence, which serves as a model for the cosmic-scale mind at a future point in time (Omega). Realizing our role as Vishnu the Preserver in the story of the Becoming of Brahman, unifies Atman (individual consciousness) with Brahman (universal consciousness) in a metaphorical sense. It leads to what could be described as an Omega Point in the evolution of the individual.
>
> As we face the challenges of our time — from environmental crises and social inequalities to the threat of world war — this new complexity theory spin on an old cosmic perspective can provide guidance and inspiration. It reminds us that our choices and actions can ripple out as a causal stream across global society, demonstrating that we have the power and responsibility to consciously shape the future of life and cosmos in our corner of reality. It challenges us to see beyond our immediate concerns and to align our actions with the larger patterns and purpose of cosmic becoming. By embracing this view, we can find deeper meaning and motivation in our lives, seeing our personal growth and collective progress as integral parts of the universe's journey towards self-realization. The Becoming of Brahman, and the Coming of Cosmic Christ, is a story waiting to be written by us, and our collective actions." - [Constructing the Meta-Religion: Mapping Concepts from Eastern and Western Religion onto the Story of a Self-Organizing Universe, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/constructing-the-meta-religion-mapping#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20the,our%20collective%20actions.)

sympathetic vs parasympathetic nervous system





Human potential is being squandered on a grand scale


this architecture for reputation and competence can be used by nations, by corporations or any kind of organization


it is necessary for humanity to realize the necessity of weeding out all corruption - perhaps the singularity is when a species collectively realizes the importance of cooperation and reorienting everything fundamentally on that principle - leading to the next higher level of complexification

The civilizational singularity/step function is when the complete reorientation over the principle of consequence capture occurs

we can independently assess other models & egregores for their competency - based on our own assumptions and presuppositions

completely trustless is counterproductive (truly crypto-native protocols) - we simply need better trust - a transparency and reputation system - a new game

transparency builds trust and trust attracts customers. Customers of anything - aka humans want the truth despite their irrational psychological predispositions

labeling data needs rewards for correct labeling - an incentive for truth

what if we gave incentives for anyone being some kind of annotator - to have to specialize in some area of the world and compete transparently & prove competence & accountability
We would effectively be training an AI how to label things in any vertical - and we could connect all those verticals in a single latent space and aggregate the predictive wisdom of the crowd that way
What if this was the data engine for the global brain - a single unified neural network that makes predictions and prescriptions when prodded about the future? With a full trace of thought.

If we dissolve the boundries between companies and merge them into an integrated system with coherent and aligned incentives then there wouldn't be aberrations like trying to induce more demand for (junk) food (that would lead to sickness) than what comes naturally.

Reconceptualizing our relationship with the universe

We should move as far away as possible from pay to play - everyone should have access

Claude Shannon is more important than the kardashians

The less I can infer what others know and think - the less I interact with them. We are a society without community

We are conscious to varying levels - how do we increase the level of others?

You have a moral responsibility in choosing what our system should be - you’re incentivised to contribute and cooperate
Co-operati

The role of a God is to tell you what to do

Who nudges the nudgers?

We need to consciously guide our development throughout time - we need to specify what the most appropriate way to be is, and have a trustworthy and legitimate process for determining that

Legitimacy needs to be CONTINUALLY/perpetually earned

what if we could track and visualize the progress of anyone in anything within their knowledge tree and simply pick publickly the best ones - and make working in public the only way of legitimizing power

what would society look like if it was run by those with a high [H-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) in academia? And what if we could also fix all the flaws in academia?
https://youtu.be/slURwmgTZbc?t=270

What if one of the measures of a society was how many people can fully comprehend and explain Goedel's incompleteness theorem?

We have a popularity contest intertwined with idiocracy

What if a society would consciously choose to have 10% of the airtime to be interviews of mathematicians and physicists talking about how they fell in love with science and explaining different aspects of it?


malevolence shouldn't be able to hide


or imagine an ultra wealthy person being able to anonymously say what they think and prove that he has 10B$+ for example


imagine when institutes & universities give attestations & credentials to their alumni and staff and we could have for the first time in history an anonymized account of what scientists want to express & convey to us - in aggregate!


Empathy needs to be extended - the alternative is war and genocide


Case study: the book “the elephant in the brain” doesn’t reveal much to psychologists but it is relevant to professionals in healthcare and other areas. But they ignore it because they bucket it as a psychology book. What if there was a way to simply show the relevance of the book to their field and what parts it touches/impacts?
Lots of known things in one field get completely neglected in another field - even if highly relevant.


what if people could score the open source work of others in terms of how hard it was and how valuable it was, and reward the contributors based on those metrics? If someone consistently says the work of others is bad or was easy he might not get his work scored high even if it deserves it if he has been a jerk





what if supermarkets put the closest what we need most often - and put candy and everything else further?
Google - why do they hide the candy and put the healthy stuff more easily accessible & visible?


Simplicity as a design goal - the sculpture that is refining itself from fat to thin
https://www.google.com/search?q=sculpture+carving+itself

typical neural networks encode patterns and knowledge - this "neural network" encodes competence and instead of distributed it follows a power law distribution in terms of contribution from each neuron

we can have a "request for labeling/annotating" signal

concentrating the discussion and arguments/contention to a single place, annotation and linking to media pieces is separate

defining "missions" for tasks that need completion - with requirements, prerequisites, topological sortition, impact analysis, etc.
Missions - the building block of cooperation

we need to get the expertise and thoughts of people out of their heads and/or scattered & fragmented media and fuse them and make them accessible & explorable in the global brain

A global news feed for any topic

how the saussage is made when it comes to legitimacy - full raceability & accountability/transparency



What if every industry was regulating itself? Through transparency

Every nation will be able to archive all data and not have to 100% trust a foreign AWS for example - there’s always a backup option to participate and be completely independent

Anything you’d want to express - you’d be able to (in a way that matters) and have your input weighted based on your contributions

We must eradicate media manipulation

This is the logical addressing layer on top of the physical nature/layer of the internet - aka location in the real world (IP)
addressing:
1) OS => 2) physical network => 3) data network 
2) host-centric (IP & DNS) => 3) identity-centric


Anybody should be able to explore the global opinion of what is meaningful in life - give filtration criteria - a PoV - and get their perspective

Imagine how you would express yourself - “strong dislike” from the emotions menu, or “this should be top10 news for today” - specialized kinds of signals for most of the things we care about

The global reputation arena - the global skill exhibition arena

Describe a perfect world and ask “Why don’t we crowdsource what we want, and after that how do we think we could get it?”

If we export the competence of people in a trust-building and quantifiable way, we will get the best people. And people should want to compete to be the best

Its alignment all the way down

There’s no escaping status games - but we can culturally evolve our conception of status

Status mobility supercharged - complementary to economic mobility

- How much of our consumption is entirely driven by status games?
- How much of the GDP comes from defense & war?
- How much would the GDP shrink because of "health"care implosion if everyone was healthy? And wouldn't that lead to growth in other areas with all that human capital?
- How much are people underdeveloped and undereducated?
- How much human & natural resources are misdirected?

How many of your claims have been overturned as a %? And what about with weights? A gauge for trustworthiness & competence 

It will become a competitive advantage for firms to allow their employees to export their achievements and competence and take it with them elsewhere - no more hoarding of information which leads to epistemic asymmetries and more inequality




We need to harness the competence of everyone - we require transparency but we reward with a big carrot - the opportunity to earn legitimate and noble status

Optimal common knowledge - only those that need to know about something know about it - perfect modulation of signal according to individual interests, as long as there’s no lying and manipulation, for which there are consequences

What if, just what if, we made an incentive for transparency, competence, and accountability? What would a civilization emerging from that look like?

We need an incentive to not want to harm others

trust issues prevent cooperation

The less fragmented the info space - the more eyeballs on whatever is public and more common knowledge - making lying harder

Open source corporations - with transparent democracy for any type of reward

we can have AIs that do documentaries on any subject from multiple different points of view - perfect competition of partially overwrapping hiveminds

Wealth inequality - besides the issues of inflation and lack of education around money and finance for the masses, what if we rewarded CEOs with status a lot more and much less with money? Even stock ownership in terms of options could be reduced a lot if the performance of their company under their rule mattered to their status, future employability and legacy? Instead of a claim over resources.

Regulating the market - it comes down to additional layers of incentives and instead of leaving that to unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats we could crowdsource it

"I recommend X" - This tweet should be replaced by a specialised recommendation signal
https://twitter.com/jim_rutt/status/1702678201544171997

this is an incentive protocol that's the same on every level - global and local


by expressing an argument that has never been expressed before is being the first to take a position on it and effectively announcing this new poll to the world with your action

what if companies could strive towards the path of a 0 $ marketing budget, by following the requirements of the ecosystem - "if you do X and Y you'd get distribution & mindshare"

journalists are jacks of all trades, masters of none - why do we listen so much to them and form our opinions on so many topics if we can instead extract & harness the understanding of the most capable within a field?

what if there was a languge for expressing any idea uniquely, such that the discussion around it could be focused at a single point - removing confusion & optimizing information dissipation

a structural upgrade - a step change in the ability of the superorganism to process information and introspect

we can annotate the world and make it so that when entities from the real world want to take the voice of their representation - there's a way to redirect everything towards the same ID - a port of all previous data links to point to an account (previously it was a URI element created by someone else)

We need to view this problem through a systems lens

Not an app. Not a platform. Not a protocol. A complex adaptive ecosystem

define a game nobody could object to. a science-based cult with built-in error correction and a drive for self-improvement. The next religions will be those of self-manifesting incentive designs and this is the first of them.

the world we live in is the result of incentives. Change the incentives (aka bribe their cooperation and coordination and transparency with your attention - guaranteed business) - change the system within a single generation.

the real singularity is the shift to perfectly aligned incentives - after which all bets are off for what our civilization could achieve

as soon as some aspect that's been put to a vote changes suddenly in a drastic way one way or another - we could simply look at the top trending topics at that time to quickly gauge what this thing is all about

we need to build incentives for our own media system which disincentivizes lying and bribe a portion of the population to self-organize into the best at labeling certain kinds of data correctly

reducing the problem to a single place where it is discussed, but all other discussions simply point to it. every event/concept/data can be discussed and anywhere it is being mentioned - the epicenter of the discussion around it will be linked to - to browse through different viewpoints

self-manifesting error correction

at one layer of voting, we vote for which data/signal needs the most to be annotated propositionally - separately from the layer that does the actual work... what? :D

every conceivable question that makes sense should be expressable through a canonical form and be given a unique ID for reference

a system for stacking & compounding layers of transparent sensemaking

for anyone paying attention - there has been so much media bias against a company like Tesla since the start - egregious lying - as long as a civilization we have an incentive & media system that produces that we fail to get the best of the next generation and play most zero-sum games instead of striving towards optimality & cooperation

if you stubmle upon something which should obviously be tried because everyone wins if it works and the first to back it stand to profit - if you stumble upon such a thing - you try to make it work.

How do we go from "Ice bucket challenge" => to "global calculate-your-carbon-footprint challenge" or "measure your trash in 1 week challenge" or "learn how X works challenge"
https://www.wren.co/

compound interest => compound legitimacy

carrot & stick => this model vs the China model

division of labor - incentive for this, incentive for that, different specialization verticals

the world as it is vs the world as we'd like it to be

case study: the Oscars redone through this multi-perspective system - or how about Nobel prizes?

what if we mapped what we should care for if we care about our children?

information isn't equal - it needs to be weighted

meme: why can't you be normal?
what is normal? corruption? kleptocracy? popularity contests every 4 years, multipolar traps, war? we need a system reboot now!

gradually scaling/colling out annotation communities & developing/evolving best practices cookbooks/guides

for stupid claims like "Elon could have solved world hunger with 5 billion $" - if it's too hard to put into an ontology we could simply let ppl vote on the stupidity of it


you should be able to change the way you want top results to be surfaced for any subreddit

what if we could incentivise & signal what the ecology of practices should be

instead of building arctic code vaults to preserve code, we should be working on the root of civilization - incentive design

we need to make the best system for giving the best tools to anyone for anything which does not cause externalities - the nexus of cooperation and coordination - the nexus of global brain thought

we are so blind to recognize the suggested improvements by the top complexity scientists and evolutionary thinkers - the most obvious improvements that anyone should be clamoring for. We have a system which does not produce coherence oriented towards what makes sense for all

the bigger the group chat - the bigger the assumed common knowledge. Group chats & trust groups are the way to common knowledge

we need to incentivize the next iteration of wikipedia - not simply writing the opinions of a selected group, but allowing for any group to have their beliefs expressed & comprehended by others & compared

this is the best game to be playing ever - work transparently & earn credibility which is also appreciated by the old system - you win either way - and this protocol of cooperation and transparency can gradually shift to the top

what if instead of the system nudging us towards subscribing to each other within friends so that we stalk each other & generate engagement - what if instead of that, the system nudged us towards subscribing to the best dashboards and where the most consensus & transparency lay

case study: how might we improve & automate reasoning about token emission schedules?

separate the currency stuff from the social media account stuff - one set of accounts that are addressed by their public key, and another set of accounts that have integers as IDs and where the IDM magic happens

we need to add cerosine to the engines of optimization of civilization & introspection

imagine if instead of snapchat triggering your psyche with "streaks" we had such incentives for doing work & helping moderate the internet & earn rewards based on competence, volume of work and accountability

we need to allow any aspect of society to be able to evolve towards competence & results with the least amount of effort

how do we crowdsource & self-organize "proof of human"?

recursive self-reflection requires that any concept/entity/event has a single entry that can be referenced, and from then branch towards whatever else needs to be queried. unifying all concepts/entities/events under unique entries is a foundation for optimal recursive thought

we need to give executive power to that which is most competent, visionary, all-loving, accountable and transparent - simple as that. we need an incentive system for that

“Program or be programmed” - why programming needs to be fully transparent and participatory

A more human-aligned media landscape where a parallel economy will evolve

There is game theory to joining the network as a nation first - because you could earn the most trust and have more dealings as a result

This coordination infrastructure can be reused for corporations or any kind of human organization - for domain-specific wikis and governance and reputation and dispute resolution and tracking of contribution
We can make a market where a 10x developer gets 10x the reward

Let's solve every problem just once - like open source


Let them compete for status - as long as we define the rules of the game

How do we handle cases where somebody was wrong in the end but at the time their guess made the most sense?

The other side of a permanent record

The resource and service economies are downstream from the attention economy

Framing is everything in media. It is relevance manipulation

Crowdsourcing relevance realization

The global constitution will not be written - it will be emergent

What if we bribed companies for donating as much as possible to our causes of choice and getting in return the market share of advertising - how much do we hear about them. This way if they want exposure they play by our rules - there is no more lobbying - this is crowdsourced lobbying

What if the currency of life is time - we all get more of it (UBI) one a month and get to redistribute it to whoever you think most deserves it. The ability to elevate what’s working properly. This should be our main source of status and competition - how much of this imaginary time-gifting currency one could get - because it literally translates us to having more authority and legitimacy

This is the “help us make sense of the world” network - this is the cooperation attractor - “help me, help you” https://youtu.be/B8NOJa2DwIs?t=5

These currencies would be the ATP for sustaining relevance 

Any competence vertical could have its own currency.

The ability to choose whether you’d check someone’s perspective based on their track record of playing according to the rules in good faith, combined with their competence

The whole ecosystem could have lower operating costs because a lot of work could be incentivised not with salaries but with status

We can reward for volume of work done or predictions made too

People can be gifted the competency currency or it could be collected as a bounty for a successfully completed public request

Epistemic currencies

This is how we get to the best human for any position that we needs to be filled

we need to deliberately improve our ability to prune big sections of the possible decision tree - improving our ability to realize what is relevant

they are exploiting our desire to connect - the ability to contact a person shouldn't also require you to go throgh an interface that tries to suck your time and hijack you. Connection and communication are hostage to an attention hijacking operation that's misaligned with humans

What if every button that would lead to an event creating action had a tiny color box in one of the corners showing the default visibility for this action, and with a hold we could get a popup to inspect it.

People compete for status in freemium games where whales spend tens of thousands of dollars to be recognised. We should channel this drive towards something productive

China can determine the type of content kids get through TikTok - what's our non-authoritarian solution to do the same? There is none.

how would we decentralize and crowdsource the banner with Covid-19 info that accompanied so much media?

being able to bookmark a search/filter query and treat that as a feed and have notifications for new entries

we need to incentivise being a moderator

we can participate in and direct our cultural programming

We need to aggregate expression

every "reviews" or "criticisms" section in wikipedia could (and should) be crowdsourced & computed with structured data

we can flag whataboutism

the foundation of social capital is a global identity protocol that can be permissionlessly extended

Any aspect of how we aggregate votes could be put to a vote - self-recursion

How much cheaper would be services to develop if they were done in the open and they got the help of contributors?
Closed source is a bug in software and the inability to export competence out of companies is a missed opportunity
Todo: crowdsourcing service development
“Hey if we solve this problem publicly make sure to use services that pay us a royalty for our discovery”

We need to make weighing signals profitable

The currencies of the 21st century aren’t linked to resources directly - there will simply be no transferability. Soulbound 
Daniel S. has been riffing on how to make something that is not fungible to resources.
Status as the soulbound currency.
There is a new game in town - parallel to resources - and we put other criteria on a pedestal and in the driver's seat

The closer our model of the world to reality - the less suffering there will be and the less existential risk.

We can take control of the system by offering our attention - programming our relevance realization

What if we feed the result of the collective intelligence into what the rules should be for a global currency and we started opting into it? And it could have privacy and ZK and whatnot

The meta crisis is solved only with alignment.

The root of power is sovereignty of identity

Wisdom is about decision pruning - it is about enhanced intelligence - relevance realization is intelligence

Synchronicity - conscious triggering of availability cascades around social & environmental issues as awareness campaigns

the ability to view only items that have not yet been viewed, or showing them differently in the UI

We need an alignment hierarchy to modulate signals - orchestrating/directing the attention of the world

We can publicly vote on how well someone did on a job

We need a way to ask any question about how to solve any problem and get the best result for that

We are an organism with a dysfunctional information system

Toggle between the views of different egregores

We need a unification mechanism

The only way to alignment is through transparency

We need to transparently crowdsource our management - using reputation and competence as signal

Crowdsourced “Should there be a law for X, and if so - what?” - always up to date and responsive to changes

We need to give every possible expression and idea a unique ID

why we need transparent money flows

https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1708809676387705002

What if we could codify social norms & responsibilities - completely opt-in?
A way to calculate the degree of commitment to an egregore

What is education if not the conscious indoctrination of children into a set of norms and mental models?

Democracy 2.0 is computable

In order to merge our minds we need to give unique and shared addresses for entities

Social media has to be socially controlled

what if every science paper had to have its conclusions expressed with propositional logic?

Marrying responsibility with accountability

A toolkit for collective intelligence and information integration

Privacy zk and anonymity - the law of conservation - you can only spend your credibility once

Our civilisational kernel is an information architecture that can best enable alignment, optimisation and collective consciousness - information integration

Conscious pursuit of alignment is the most potent manifestations of conscious evolution

Why is curiosity good? Because it enhances focus


How do we give the best mental models in the most accessible way topologically sorted based on relevance and complexity to kids?

Universal basic status

Hey global brain, summarize 2023 for me amd play it in a 15 minute clip with the highlights

If we invent a mechanism that would eventually get us to the perfect and most fair state, then taxation should be of our biggest interest

Our number one goal should be to consciously choose how information propagates. The singularity is when life figures out that the only game in town is consciously optimising the flow of information

Teansparency is a precursor to alignment

What if we could use AI to generate media that would best let us feel what the global brain is seeing and thinking?

We could browse the global catalog of events, ask AI go give us summaries about any plane of inquiry

Imagine being able to ask “why are things the way they are” and you could get educated enough to understand any answer


We can vote on the score of companies and vote on what we’d want from them in exchange for a higher score. They use their score to better market their stuff for profit

We need a system of transparency to cannibalize a system of opacity

There isnt an organisation in the world that wouldn’t want to work with transparent companies where accountability and competency is rewarded

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
https://www.google.com/search?q=Do+unto+others+as+you+would+have+them+do+unto+you


What if part of your status was calculated based on your positions in previous jobs

Imagine being a corporation that knows about this parallel information system and you dont want to join - WHY NOT ?!?! Are you hiding something?


What if we signal boosted people to be able to say what they want to be heard when they donate to charity, and depending on the amount?

!!! What would discord look like? !!!

The real singularity is when we integrate our information and our minds

Good judgment is relevance realization

Feature extraction and pattern recognition

Recognition as a source of meaning

Why don't we let ourselves program our cultural norms?

In an ideal world with the best possible culture we would be doing X. We could never reach perfection, but how close could we get to it? 

Such a system would also incentivise more open source - not just from companies but also from separate individuals - this could be their CV for competence

What if you could browse what the world is trying to tell you - browse it any way you want as a young person?




Elon Musk has signal-boosted X accounts with problematic history numerous times - what if he could easily gauge their reputation from a few different angles instantly with a score?

Subsidiary/nested deployment of the same sensemaking/governance stack

The seeds of war are lies and misunderstanding and a lack of informational integration

Agency requires making models of the future with causal simulations
minimizing surprise when predicting the world

The forces behind cultural evolution should be transparent

Engagement farming is a disease because it is almost always irrelevant and/or inflaming/manipulative

Attention is the currency of consciousness

Reputation is the cure

Hoarding knowledge is inhumane

voting a certain way only if a threshold of such commitments by others is reached - like with SIMPOL
if & only if contracts - like the SIMPOL solution - expands the 2x2 prisoner's dilemma to a 3x3 grid with a new nash equilibrium with a payoff like the cooperate box but beating out the logic of the defect box

Objective reality just is. It's our job to integrate it and live according to nature’s laws.

what if I could allow myself to be influenced by someone without having to read every single text tweet by them? What if we could automate influence?

We need a system where we wouldnt be able to end up with malicious media bias towards a company like tesla

Transparent reputation tribunals

We need incentives to wire & integrate information

We need to address knowledge - giving a permanent and single ID to anything and be able to find it.

Status is a non-fungible currency - if you sell out you’d be destroying a lifetime of work


We need a competing signal to the money-on-money return paradigm

"The greatest fallacy of democracy is that everyone's opinion is worth the same." - Robert A. Heinlein

We need a distributed system that fact-checks the fact-checkers

We need to convert status-seeking through excessive consumption to recognition for contribution - we need to reward the contributors - the altruists

If we crowdsource the collective intelligence for every aspect of a problem along with their relations - well we have solved the problem

The moral offramp from GameA is to start contributing as much as possible

Universal basic rewards bundle - recognition - that can & should be given to others. Who do u recognise and for what?

What is a facebook group? Information and membership curation - a silo. We could have so many such different clubs with differing settings and customs and etc.

We need legitimate global trust

Integration presupposes consequence capture

We can use the top 10% of ranked accounts and use their voices with different weights depending on their ranking and we could vote on the constants for that vote

We need to make smear campaigns impossible

Imagine a mindset where you know the system isn't stacked against you but is actually maximally cooperative and trying to give you the tools to succeed - how much more meaning there would be

Imagine being able to reuse the same browsing architecture from the open web to your private files and data and notes - same data structures, algorithms and queryability

An alternative competition outlet - not money but status through knowledge and responsibility

Giving data weight

The new incentive system for expertise

Imagine being able to explore how any part of the system works - and the ability of the system to generate the best possible explanation - specialized to you

Anonymous whistleblowing

The nations that first jump ship will end up with the highest legitimacy and responsibility

How do we make intentional lying/bias not a thing in media?

The media and entrenched interests are guilty of crimes against humanity for their coverage of Tesla since its inception. It is an a-moral force that needs to be eradicated - corruption should be stopped

We will talk to the global brain through language

Transparent crowdsourcing of the arbiter of truth

We need to make thinking from first principles the cultural norm

The mind is a pattern-matching machine - it makes sense that we should want to pattern-match the most competent and responsible and put them in charge

The global brain is the most meta goal we could have - the one with the highest impact

The current system is a meme. What is our way of consciously evolving that meme? We arent conscious - nobody is in the driver’s seat - its a runaway freight train
Goliath is an emergent result of our system of systems

We need to see who is pushing for any meme - whats their history and what are their motivations



the great decoupling (material/resources/fungible currencies vs epistemic status)


Contributing a crucial piece of information (a missing piece from a puzzle) could be heavily incentivized, but accompanied by a much bigger penalty for supplying wrong information compared to applying the wrong tag to something. The reward can be delayed so that an agent cannot immediately profit from supplying false information in some time-sensitive arbitrage situations.

The Manhattan Project of integrating the superorganism's information.

What if society votes on how to redistribute some common pool of funds - either taxes or donations (that we can incentivise)?

Why not using wikiquote instead of these two other sources of quotes? Because the lack of a crowdsourced ranking - however imperfect

We should be able to introspect what are the kinds of people we’re allowing to guide us culturally - because we need mass cultural programming - always have been - but we need to put the right people in charge. How?

How do we reinvent TED - a curator for ideas worth spreading, but as a mechanism?

What if we could publicly have a conversation about what kind of movies we should have? This is meta-governance and we’ve left it out of our control

Manifesting science fiction

A crowdfunding campaign where the crowd funders get to decide who gets how much and get to vote publicly on which companies to fund and which builders to back and propose - in addition to the founding team. Let's crowdsource the vanguard of this ecosystem - a fund that owns a bit of everything

Quotes and their rankings are relevance realization - a very crude version of the collective’s vote

We need to become game designers - the choice of what culture we uplift is ours to make
What is our dopamine economy?


The sign should read: "If you want power - go ahead and get it, but earn it legitimately"

We can run a parallel global democracy for years and when ready with the numbers and confidence of the new selects and the mechanisms we can switch the world within a 4 year election cycle

In small tribes we could express an opinion about anything and be heard - how do we express that some show on TV is bad for us?

How to do arbitrage in reputation markets? Signal that someone deserves more credit and them benefit for signalling that after the other person has proven themselves and their success is widely recognised. Same for the other way around
We need such arbitrage to exist in order to make the reputation “market” efficient




We need to end even just the possibility of nuclear war - what’s the plan?

Social legitimacy score

It is inconceivable why anyone would settle for anything less than futarchy

Global brain missionaries help people make sense of the world

Lets get the right kinds of people in the right structures of power

What if we all picked a problem to solve and worked in public?

If you can provably and reliably predict the second and third-order effects of policies and have superior modeling of the world - you should be in charge.

Why dont we crowdsource what we would like out of utopia?

Transparency and truth should be core values - more important than anything - the maximizers of fairness and cooperation. Incorruptability is the only game in town / worth playing. Evolution is telling us so

We need to make as many aspects of history computable as possible

Computation is a kind of memory - that is why we need to make history and reputation computable

We need to crowdsource truth and competence in every vertical of the economy and public service

Succumbing to endless growth expressed as consumption of resources should be a sin

How do we crowdsource the most resilient survival algorithm and then find the most compelling and accessible way to consume the story - on every level?

Why don't we crowdsource how we think children should be raised, and why?

What is the real economy?

Here we can express anything and have that actually matter instead of drowning in the void or irrelevance and inconsequality

What if different levels of reputation unlocked benefits that extend to the real world and to resources and consumption - like vacations? What if we could pool money (and nudge companies to donate) and then distribute those funds however we like?
STACK OVERFLOW BOUNTIES !!!
Some reputation systems go further, making it explicitly possible to spend reputation within the system to derive a benefit. For example, on the Stack Overflow community, reputation points can be spent on question "bounties" to incentivize other users to answer the question.

The Church ot Truth says that the more transparency and accountability and integration of information - the harder it is to lie.





Free will is a harmful concept - we need to focus more on the environment, systems and development and not put all of the responsibility on the individual
^^ rethink this
https://medium.com/unified-theory-of-knowledge/utoks-take-on-the-free-will-versus-determinism-debate-3f051e77dd31
we do make choices



If we don’t aim at giving the best possible education to as many kids as possible - we are dooming humanity or at least exacerbating societal and survival problems in the future

addressing in computing: layer 1: at the OS level, layer 2: at the physical network level (internet, IP), layer 3: identity-based
personal computing, distributed computing, social computing

Dragging and dropping, freely rewiring data & functional nodes

everybody is an author, editor, publisher, critique, curator, librarian
everything you do you do for yourself, but you also organize the environment for others

what if regulation was cultural and not done through legislature?

learning in public - the best form of career progression




Blocking someone doesn’t send them a signal that they’ve done something wrong - a public label that a comment was hateful does something else


Compound identity/reputation - like knowledge and interest
Reputation compounds just like knowledge and interest
> "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76863-compound-interest-is-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-he)
But compounding applies not only to interest but also to reputation and knowledge.
compounding is the root of all progress, but in today's world it's mostly expressed as monetary interest and knowledge and reputation to a much lesser extent. We've allowed claims on resources to dictate way too much - we need to tilt the scales


What if we could label squatters of names - taking up valuable names for speculation - and what if we could penalize them reputationally? Ala social regulation. Stigma.
Any kind of resource hoarding should be stigmatized - not enforced through regulation but simply culturally stigmatized.

Democracy in its current form is captured - wake up

Crowdsource the question about self-driving cars - all aspects - give examples

How much sugar should we eat? Crowdsource every such question!

What does having a pet cost the world? Why is the media pushing people to reconsider having a pet?

Crowdsourcing the global number of children policy as an opinion?

What is the role of an elite?

tagging and annotating is classification and organization of data. stigmergy!

the real change happened multiple generations after the invention of the printing press - we're still early with what's about to happen because of the internet

How do we shorten the time for the adoption and dissipation of new knowledge to everywhere it’s needed? Propagation speed is part of the integration puzzle

most game-theoretic concerns are made obsolete through transparency
transparency and openness are post-game-theoretic

create Humanity's/the Global Brain's hierarchy of needs - what comes after Maslow

Ontology - nouns and verbs of your business - not just the data model (nouns), but also the actions that can happen (verbs)

We can shame the investment firms and banks that pressure food companies to increase their revenues at all costs (like putting more sugar in food)

Interpretability for the collective intelligence is solved from day 1 - it's the absolute opposite of a black box

How much value does open source generate? How many billions?

What if we could score people on how well they’ve covered all arguments and if they’ve covered all arguments at all or are extremely biased and missing the bigger picture?
If you give an opinion on one of the arguments of a debate - you should also give an opinion/weighting of importance to all the rest - otherwise your opinion would be classified as incomplete.

Presets like “only allow these accounts to contact me and notify me for only these types of events”

The only way to fix our problems is to get everyone on the same page

How do we rank our problems? How do we stigmatize and tax fast fashion?

Predictive processing needs precision weighting - prioritizing one set of signals over another

lying and misrepresentation of facts is costing the world tens of trillions per year by misallocating capital & labor

Our cutting-edge understanding of the world isn’t evenly distributed. It is in some fields to some degree, but it is hopelessly not true in others

Informational compulsive overconsumption & addiction
But all the books in the world wont make a difference if the tools are built in an exploitative way where we can’t set restraints for ourselves
Focus on addiction in the book
Countless books about dopamine and addiction
How do we counter indulgence?

A social network where your life gets better when you join - thats the goal.
Meaning, self-improvement, happiness, health and connection. What if you’re assigned to a random group of people who want to improve and are provided with guidelines from the most successful other groups?

How do we build de-escalation into the system?

What happens if you literally ask in tandem “what is most important” together with “why” over and over again - recursively?
Curiosity is the seed of intelligence - it needs to be nourished above all else

We can calculate at any point in time how far you are from consensus on any issue in this ever-changing complex world and we can choose how much to discount your views by

Sovereignty for consciousness

Good judgment is relevance realization - good judgment is intelligence
It’s as obvious as hell

We can get everyone with an equal vote in stating our values and use a different weighting system for the competitive and cognitively demanding competition for intelligence - directed toward the benefit of all

What if we paid the highest possible price to elevate true virtue?

What if investigative journalism was of utmost prestige and such journalists wouldn’t need to sell their souls? How do we incentivize truth?

We don’t have just shared intentionality - we also have a shared fate.
This ^^ goes as theme 11
Our intent should be to steer that faith.

The deepest possible alignment & integration is the singularity

Anyone can join this network - and most will after even only one reading of this book - how could you object to this mechanism if you’re acting in good faith?

This is how we scale good faith - alignment comes through rewarding competitiveness for the good of the collective
Sex is the highest motivation - it is the root - monetary claims on resources are simply the old metric for maximization - we need to change our culture toward sustainability

This mechanism is like a disinfectant pill dropped into the oceans - any nation or region may opt-in to disinfect itself and earn legitimacy

Deep down we all want to be part of a unified humanity that fulfills its potential - a participatory culture that generates the best possible outcome.

We need to figure out our redistributive system - how do we all make it? Wagmi

Studying how you came to be (biology, evolution, life, physics) tells you where you need to go.

The market for truth will subsume the word
We need the invisible hand for truth (which is reputation coupled with transparency)

Consciousness can be beautiful - it can be a gift - and it should. Especially when the ride is shared: “hey! you witnessed that too, right?”
We don’t have just shared intentionality - we also have a shared fate.
Consciousness is a gift. How do we make a system where we could expand it?

We need to crowdsource censorship by leveraging collective intelligence and a truth market

It's all about sexual selection? Always has been
Money is about sexual selection - we need to make an alternative competitive field that's unconvertible to claims over resources

What women select for is what we get in men
> "Men are the means; women are the motive." - [Naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/10456426317)

What if we could calculate drift - modern day "liberalism" is so far from what liberalism originally meant. We could track how much further communities drift from their original stated goals & values - a metric to think about.

an identity & addressing overlay for IPFS that fixes many of its problems

This whole book is an exercise of relevance realization RR. Ranking properly is the name of the game

Once reputation becomes the foundation for weighing data and recommendations - what happens to SEO? The only way to boost something would be to actually have a good reputation of delivering value

How do we express how we think our culture should change, and why?
Like how do we stigmatize wearing worn clothes?

How do we force people to use less plastic?

Think of this as the architecture of consciousness - and we’d be discussing it and improving upon it on itself - on the next plane of emergence - a place of higher order informational integration

The system ain’t perfect, folks… lets fix it
 
Transparency and openness fixed the problem with interviewing for jobs - all you have to do is simply to contribute somehow to the job - join their ranks in parallel and submit a few PRs and let them evaluate your work and decide if they would want to hire you. We need to make any kind of intellectual work possible through this system - a maximally open system

Every single aspect of this system should be dog fed to itself for further refinement, scrutiny and improvement - a self-referential system for governance
Next level forums

Legitimacy should be earned - not bought or inherited.

Many good people don’t want to stick their necks out in the current political and media environment. But what if the system was fixed such that only good-faith actors were elevated?

Seducing people to switch over to a richer and more multivariate world of status within a few generations

Emergent governance

What kinds of literacy should everyone possess?

The level of education is positively correlated with confirmation bias - at least the current type of education

Money on money return is a feedback loop - how do we transition away from competing for claims over resources to a status-on-status return feedback loop?

You dont have to agree with everything proposed here - and thats the cool thing - you’d be able to push back against what you don’t like



Computed history/identity is important not only to gauge someone’s reputation and capabilities quickly once you stumble upon them but also for discovery. Currently, for discovery we need to hear in language from someone regarding someone else (and we also get an incomplete context)

Nature is telling us “hey you fools, before spewing out whatever comes to mind try to learn from prior art - there is nothing more art than nature

Internet 2.0 is about values, knowledge, and alignment

We need to wake up after this multi-century intermission of purpose

Attention is a resource - that's why we say "to pay attention"

What’s the “view source” analogy in this ecosystem?

It's all feedback within the mother of all complex adaptive systems called humanity

The current media environment is breaking many people and in different ways - some become completely dysfunctional

Reductionism vs complexity - the study of the dancer vs the dance

fragment and conquer

Subreddits are a form of relevance realization

We need to scale trust beyond national borders - a single unified identity meta-network


Alignment is about reducing the friction of cooperation - we need a global trust network

Markets are for satisfying desires around scarcity
We need a market that can not be bought (buying your way in) simply with resources - the only way would be alignment and contribution

We can vote on how our taxes get spent - a market for public service instead of corruption
Anything less than a market for surfacing truth is suboptimal


How do we publicly elevate those that we think deserve it?

We need to make intent public
The more transparent and better in predicting the world - the better

Existence can be cool. How do we increase the coolness and how do we gift it to as many consciousnesses as possible for perpetuity?

We all want to be loved - why do kids cry when they know they are being punished and disliked?


We’ve been sold to the highest bidder
How do we make it more costly to play against society? How do we remove parasitic behavior?

Corruption is a parasite and sunlight is the best disinfectant
The system is built on opaqueness and parasites hide in the dark

What should I do with my life?

What you propagate culturally is the ultimate purpose of life. Contribution to others.

The ultimate question is what should we teach our kids?

Raising kids should be all about teaching them alignment
That should be the core of generational transmission

The ultimate goal in life is to decide what to leave after you. You can make moral choices and leave a trace for others. Crowdsourcing “what is fair”

What does it mean to solve 

We have an expiration date. That should be the central focus of our lives - why are we here, what would we leave behind

What is the greatest story to be told? How do you leave a mark and have your life have meaning. How do we solve meaning?

Working in the gambling industry? Why?

The meaning, interdependence & service (not just services) economy

Compassionately winning the culture war

how do we replace scientific journals to curators with reputation and a funding mechanism?

The culmination of Darwin's discovery is the complete understanding and conscious application going forward of what nature has already discovered and given us on a plate - how to align agents into a collective for maximal benefit. We could complete this transition by 2059 (giving us 35 years - 1-2 generations to work with) - the 200th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species" by him.

"Is this good for me?" - how do I express that "Mr Beast" is 100% a waste of time to kids (if they they actually care about my opinion) - delivered through a relevance filter right next to the channel when viewing it or a video by it - a "context window"
What if successful kids could publicly signal what kind of media they avoid, so that other kids can make a conscious choice about where they want to take their lives going forward?

"give me the view of the world of the top 100 people according to a ruleset X, and if they don't have an opinion on something - inherit the opinion of whoever they've delegated expertise to (liquid democracy)"

Opinions on complex topics should be expressed as weights in argument maps

the relationship between the individual and the collective is the most important relationship

global governance vs global government

The evolution of the social contract & political philosophy didn't end with John Locke & John Stuart Mill & Rousseau & Thomas Hobbes

How do I signal that I want less sugar in my environment even though I will make such purchases when they are easy to make?

More examples: a feed for updates of friends & family, a feed for work, a feed for hobbies

There’s no reason to expect that an AGI will align humanity with itself - thats something we need to figure out on our own
We need to solve governance before AGI

Politicians have to constantly run photo ops and waste their time - because the way we elect them is the wrong way

A post-scarcity world is one where scarcity doesn’t matter (is irrelevant) - not one where it doesn’t exist


Expertise from one sector is rarely if ever transferrable/translatable to another - unlike fungible money. Furthermore, experts in one field grossly overestimate their understanding of other fields (a cognitive bias). We should make it impossible for outside influence over a field - either by experts from other fields or by money - reputation and expertise are not fungible from one field to another

How do we let people take ownership & responsibility?


I don't always want to have to watch your video or read your long text - just give me the TL;DR as a summary and let me choose if I want to consume the full piece to be convinced
^^ this is in conflict with the influencer's (or curator's) incentives to some degree, but the best ones that are trusted by millions will still generate enough revenue from the long-form content

Convergence gives us trustworthiness - the opposite of bullshit

A separate feed with the truffle pigs - select a few high-grade curators and let their picks show up in your “top 10 daily feed” - no infinite scroll

We need knobs for viscosity - how many replies by a single person per day, how much time before being able to change your vote

If you repeatedly reshare things that turn put to be wrong - you should get progressively penalised somehow
Endorsing and amplifying something should have consequences and is a moral choice - its your public duty to think before you act

2 sets of 5-star ratings: quality and importance

We need to engineer for emergence within a complex system - not constrain it
A lot of information are held in the dynamics of a system - not in the statics - the flows
You can turn off and on a complicated thing (a car) but not your body or an economy
Theory-practice-theory loop - not everything will work

How do we introduce market dynamics within institutions?

Twitter and modern day algos & ephemerality are incentivising throwaway engagement farming

Retrospective time well spent - ask people once a month how they rank their past activity - to tune the system

What if we could add a cost to politicians if they can’t reach an agreement?

If we’re operating into a self-organising meritocratic & alignment structure - wouldn’t an AGI be more likely to simply tag along with us within this most powerful cooperation structure? Isn’t biology the ultimate self-assembling & recycling substrate for within the environment? The ultimate closed materials loop (barring energy from the sun)?

If everything is out in the open - people will be more engaged and less disenfranchised

How do we conserve energy? How do we make it fashionable and into the consciousness/awareness of everyone? What are the lifestyle changes that are necessary?


The large expansion of our brains was to make us cultural acquisition machines - we’ve evolved to be particularly good at acquiring, storing, and organizing cultural information

Any claim can be put on two scales: certainty/likelihood and importance. That's what we need to figure out - a topological sortition of RR

We can have a license that allows only other companies within this ecosystem to use our stuff - representing a barrier/membrane between gameA and gameB

We need to purge everything dysfunctional - we need to puke it before it's too late

The ultimate litmus test is prediction

If you care about something you should express it publicly

We should be terrified by our capacity for self-hate and we should channel that energy toward improvement

Our votes lead to governments whose laws are public for anyone to see - why not do the same for voting?



You don’t want what's relevant to you to be determined by people who are not aligned with you

Expression is a primordial desire and need

We can publicly rate our happiness and then we can query what the happiest people do. Same for success, fulfillment, people dealing with death anxiety, terminal illnesses, etc.
Imagine being able to ask “what do others think” for every stage and situation of your life


Give and ye shall receive

Every dysfunctional individual is a tragedy and a symptom of our dysfunctional culture
But what is a functional individual? Let's inspect a debate map

We are at an evolutionary choke point and the only way through it is through a conscious strategy which will be implemented and carried forward through governance

Alignment score

Conviviality

How do we make a society close to 100% free from plastic?

How do we best improve the idea to make it such that others are falling in love with it?

We can simply start giving UBI to everyone in terms of prestige points that we constantly award to others - in different verticals and aspects. The market for public recognition along with a justification - we are after all a species of justification

Upgrading our hyperstructure’s architecture

The great fragmentation

We need to signal to the market what we consciously want based on merit - not just to signal through spending money

We can simply tag areas we would like to improve and then work on that and signal competence

We should build the pro-social generator on top of the internet

Identity is feudal

There should not be such a thing as private intellectual property

How do we ban disposable cups and plates and plastics?

Lets start asking “how do I improve the world”

We are evolutionary agents of distributed cognition.

What does a fully sustainable life look like and how do we build it?

Lets reward with status the first couple of companies that jump on this opportunity - picking a slice of the pie

What does a fully reusable and sustainable food chain look like - including from the store to the kitchen? How do we minimize waste?

We are each forever students and teachers

People have absolutely no clue how much more we could optimize the system

What is the act of learninng? It is attempting and either succeeding or failing but learning why you failed
What do kids go through?
Life is about making any mistake only once.

We should all ask the question why more often
We need a culture of learning, competence, and alignment

Mediocrity, suffering, meaninglessness, extinction
vs
Glory, meaning, existence and expansion

We should be healthily terrified of death - death is the single most important event after your creation - it is the end of a journey. The end of a soul. And at that moment that soul asks itself how scared it is to die. If you’ve lived without regrets there would be the least to fear - that is peace
Why do we celebrate birthdays? Why is life good?

Corruption should scare us - it is the ultimate threat

Companies with a mission that dont prioritize salaries can outcompete others because costs will be lower (potentially drastically)
A pro-humanity mission is a competitive advantage
Degrowth? More like desalary and deconsumption

A prestigious enterprise minimizes trash and environmental impact - we can boycott such ones and signal we won’t go to such places

Endocrine disruptors

we can have debate maps for how "fascist" some entity/concept is, and later calculate someone's bias score based on if they call that thing fascist

children should start from scratch with their reputation (it should be earned) - they can only inherit material wealth - not reputation

what if you could see in advance the effects of your actions on different rankings & views? Make explicit the effects of the signal you're about to emit



what if you could view all products & services through an essentialist/minimalist perspective - giving it a necessity score?

value has been made one-dimensional - anything can be bought with money (resources, influence, media, attention, credentials).



“Show only opinions of people who are certified to be aware of the entire picture/history of a problem”

Lets make the religions of the past obsolete.
Lets give people the very best possible tools - individually and collectively - for wise enlightenment - for insightfully being rational and rationally being insightful in a way thats profoundly developmental and transformative for them. What else do you want?! - John Vervaeke
Jim rutt ep147, time 1:37:50



We need a new frame of who “us” and “them” are, along with a new way of engaging with the “other”
Us vs them thinking isnt going away anytime soon - its deeply ingrained in us

so many pdf reports should be instead linked data instead of a file blob detatched from its informational sources


If our country was in a war we’d want to know the most important aspects of it, but curiously during peace time we do not engineer our media such that the most important problems are up front and made digestible (because they’re complex & interrelated)

How do we develop a love of nature instead of shopping malls in kids?
How do we simulate the experience of being in space and looking back at earth? And how do we scale that to everyone? How do we make global Mexican awareness waves for every important thing?



All games have a loop and for GameA that loop is the money-on-money return - everything boils down to the optimization and pursuit of a single perfectly fungible metric
We need to replace that loop with a civilizational OODA loop



Information session management

We need intents for our media consumption - not just for complex transactions


Transparency and openness are the soul of cooperation

The fundamental problem is that the system could be producing individuals who want to improve themselves and the system a lot more than they currently do.
What happens if we optimize and improve everything for everyone as much as possible? Shouldn’t that be the ultimate goal - the North Star?


If identity compounds then cooperation would be much more widespread because destroying your identity & starting from scratch will be too costly.

what if we could ZK-prove commitments of an X % of salaries to a common pool and reward that with status?

*~~Be~~* **Signal** the change you want to see in the world



What if “the atom of intelligence” is every one of us - to the best of our ability?

We need to signal who we trust and then track predictive power - thats all

Storytellers are meme compressors

What if the most optimal way of augmentation is not higher bandwidth but better stories that are closer to the truth supplied and ranked by the collective intelligence?

We truly are energy blind

What is corruption but cancer? And isn’t transparency the best remedy?

We can vote on every aspect of every reward for any collective

We need to think about everything as currents of life and will, and we need to realize that we are already surfing one of those - no matter if we want to or not - and we need to start thinking about how to guide these collective currents of culture more consciously. Exerting control over the future by explicitly choosing and pointing to changes you believe in

This could be the greatest generation of humanity - the pivotal two decades

What if the practice of this religion was participation in sensemaking?

Humanity is its systems and we’ve stopped iterating on our systems ever since Bretton Woods

Ultimately it's all about values - everything is causally interwoven

the participatory & subsidiary statehood operating system

How do we increase the clock rate of relevance realization? How do we overclock our CPU? How do we better integrate distributed cognition and add that consciously to our civilizational architecture?

Talk about doctest and how much value it delivers and how it cannot muster the financial support that’s required for its ongoing maintenance - a tragedy of the commons - how do we reward the right behavior?

Death is the most important event of our lives

20th-century capitalism played its role but now it's time to create something better out of its fruits (of which there are many!)
The push towards the current levels of technologic capability for the billions in terms of connectivity - the fastest way to get to scale for comms was capitalism. Now we need to upgrade the system for the next level of metasystem transitions

Cultural alignment needs to happen before mass climate migration.

We need to be honest about how the current world came to be - who we are and where we come from - the evolutionary context.

The global forecaster academy

What if - just what if - we do subsidies properly?
What's a company - doesn't it decide internally what to subsidize?

We need a system where we could experience what its like to be someone else from a different culture - an AI driven storyline with fictional characters based on the data

Problems are bad. How do we have less problems? How do we identify and solve the most pressing ones? How do we surface truth? How do we forecast the future better? How should we program the incentives in the system?





imagine a concept map/graph where you can track your progress with comprehending it - there could be competing videos/texts that explain different parts of it and to different degrees, and depending on how much of the videos you've watched your progress of concept comprehension could be updated automatically. You could get notified when new nodes in the graph emerged or if there were other changes, or if new explanatory content was made available.


We need to make whatever is most necessary to be as optimal as possible and as widely available as possible and as affordable as possible.

The smartest ape that can theorize on the essence of quasars can’t figure out basic shit in governance like how not to have the incentive to lie and degrade the social fabric

The biggest game is what we put in the heads of people



The larger the trust network - the smaller per capita necessary for defence - trending towards 0

A permissioning protocol for granting access to your data - with different levels and custom categories and tags

We can simply vote on what we think should happen - and given sufficient evidence and arguments it would be blatant corruption or incompetence to not follow up good judgement with enforcement - making the global brain upstream of legislature

Rebirth comes from the complete recycling of carbon - we’ve built a terminating-by-default civilization and only extended global consciousness and integration could snap us out of this trance towards a local top

Our ego is alone and vulnerable by default - any connection with someone else or something greater than itself brings meaning and comfort - it soothes the existential dread, it makes the journey worth it

This paradigm would be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more efficient and optimal

How do we pattern-extract the best from the best and reuse as much as possible?

Imagine we all had game points UBI for multiple “resources” and we got a constant stream and could allot more points for recognition as “upgrading a tech tree - contributing a finite resource for some cause explicitly. What if we made public who is working towards what so that we can rank them by importance and morality and also tracked who are the best performers for each of those verticals?

Global governance can be achieved through participatory cultural programming - “steering the ship” - playing the game of life consciously for the first time

What would it look like to be 10x or 100x more customer-obsessed than Amazon? What is the ultimate product?

Even never wearing torn-down clothes in public is a type of cultural norm that can be changed if some other option is better - we can collectively decide what that means.









what if we made famous those that could reliably transmit signal that would better our lives? predictors in public? mapping reality as best as possible and transmitting that to us? wisdom subscription








why can't we have charts like these updated in real time for everything in existence?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exports_of_Brazil


when you hear someone speak you cannot stop your brain from processing the language and understanding it (assuming that you know the language and the concepts being discussed) - what if we couldn't let information get to us without first filtering it or at least annotating it through a prism of trustworthiness?

What if we could flag as evil anyone spreading denial and doubt around the health implications of tobacco - or the effects of fossil fuels on climate?

What if we optimized algorithms to minimize perception gaps?

It's in the interest of all of us to try to see the world as close as possible to reality

It's inevitable that on any issue the upper bound of disagreement could be 49% if the choice is truly binary - but the key is to not let clumps of issues form - liquid democracy - unbundling governors
Bundling & unbundling
The tragedy is that the system produces a situation where we vote for the lesser of two evils

To help our rationality we should calculate as many scores as possible so that the brain can work with numbers & be more explicit and formal when ranking and sorting beliefs/views

Even if we can't compute something formally we could always crowdsource the recognition rewards as weights for the contributions of others

Alignment can happen only through reputation & computed identity/history or through force & the threat of violence
Alignment: fork in the road - choose one of these:
- reputation & computed identity/history
- threat of violence & force

What if we could express “show me only the top N opinions of the top X people while browsing any topic” and surf the web through the eyes of the best?
What if it was elite to signal the best way of life?

We need a completely new generation of experts who have been educated to think through a complex systems lens

The job of memory is to retrieve the right patterns at the right time with the right weights - how do we do this better globally?

If we surfaced what should be relevant more optimally as a culture we would be better off. This sounds cliche & trivial but we're shonkingly away from it being the case

Reward policies for contribution and improvements - how to redistribute funds - disincentivizing competition - any industry could be self-assembling with optimal self-governance such that it doesn’t make sense to compete against it when you can simply contribute to the one endeavour and get a big % of the funds if your contribution is meaningful enough. Self-assembling cooperatives with 0 large-scale vertically integrated duplications of work. How do we get the benefits of competition without the duplication of competition? Unbundling vertically integrated companies

We can signal “yes I track my carbon footprint” without revealing our targets. But no need to specify targets - or perhaps explicit & public targets would be cool?

Point/weight distribution is a way to bridge between two intelligences

What if we used fashion only for productive things? Something not tied to consumption - something relating to what our culture should be

Fashion and manufactured demand - why do ppl want laisni po tavana?
Manufactured demand should be removed

We should all want to know our biophysical cost on the system, the implications and our available choices/options for change

Art should be optimized for comprehensibility







What if we implemented our own opt-in social security along with our own rules for funds redistribution and guidelines and policing?
And what if we could at any point opt out and take the remaining share of our funds that we've contributed with us? And what if our vote for redistribution was weighted according to our share of the total pool?

Suppose the doctors we trust haven’t expressed an opinion about something, but if they’ve expressed negative opinions about some other doctor who has an opinion about this thing we can infer the opposite or at least flag it as an opinion from a doc who is disliked by our doc network

What is the most optimal layout of walking alleys on a campus? Let people walk before constructing the alleys and build them once the patterns and preferences are established. We can do the same in this ecosystem when it comes to ontologies - we can simply observe where people spend the most effort and we can amplify that effort

We can nudge companies to move to this identity-bound sensemaking software stack where whistleblowing is anonymous and provable

How do we produce humans that don’t need fixing - especially when it comes to habits and microbiome and psyche?

How do we signal that we dont drink alcohol and that we abstain from the internet & our phones for some period every day?

Mention explicitly the youtube extensions that hide the addictive stuff

we can come to an agreement on what should trigger guilt, what should be shameful, what is disgusting/taboo. Or maybe be careful with these things
https://prnt.sc/gcqM59UTGOOF

How do we see what real proven intellectuals (not merely credentialed) actually think?

Signal what kinds of traits you want to develop and leverage mimetics for that to spread





we can calculate how far off from the center someone is on all of their opinions

We need to steal the culture

A revolution of the collective consciousness

Many businesses might not be economically viable because of our culture around ownership and self sufficiency but a cultural change will enable more to be shared

What % of the economy is financial services?

Query which cohorts are using AG1 and also what % of them are paid for promoting it

Follower counts and views are regularly manipulated - an open identity network can fix such manipulation

The best and most optimal governing and sensemaking stack can be built on top of an architecture centered around identity and has the highest chance of evolving to the state of optimality precisely on it.

How do we reuse as much packaging as possible? Why do we need branded forms of packaging with patented designer shapes?


What if we could publicly pledge to commit X number of minutes per day to watch whatever our faction in aggregate wants us all to watch and be on the same page?

What if we could query the global brain how much we need to catch up in terms of worldview after our last sync?

The global brain will start thinking about every aspect in parallel as humans pay attention to certain aspects of the infosphere

Every time an aggregate preference/opinion changes (either a bit or drastically) - that would be a tick in the CPU of the global brain (or some sub-section of it) - representing progress - how do we increase this clock rate?

The global reward/loss function is multidimensional and is a collection of weights which the GB will be self-tuning

What if most people competed to optimize the global brain in the aspects that are most necessary currently - and that are democratically entered into the system?

A consciously guided, participatory, and directed economy nested within the current globalized laisse-fare economy - this is how GameB parasitizes GameA

What if we could define what we'd like our best friends to be and then instantiate them through personal AI assistants and coaches? What if there was a voice you could ask anything at any point in time and it could provide an answer you could trust?

We need to convince the billionaires to willingly (and even eagerly) contribute as much as possible towards funding an objectively better system.

We can erect a border - a membrane of the new system insulating it from non-cooperators

We can collectively govern what high-status people would be allowed entry to as they progress through the aligned game of cooperation

We need to completely remove the incentive to falsify preferences - we need to define a game where transparency, openness, accountability, and being right are the goal...? not sure :|

How do we increase the clock rate of relevance realization? That’s the big question - not simply how to mindlessly consume more energy (shout out to George Hotz)

We need to express as many opinions as possible in order to aggregate and rank them - that's the meta goal - complete expressivity

We need to crowdsource what is according to us the highest standard for which we would value others

We need to vote on what we want and then also vote for who we think is a fit for every one of the verticals



What if YouTubers didn't have to optimize for length (10-15 min videos filled with fluff) but instead optimized for the signal/noise ratio and a bang for the buck in terms of attention?


A new breed of cooperators

Personality/preference/worldview projections


> "Early clubhouse but for group chats instead of audio could work. Emergent chats based on topics with co-hosts, writer-reader delineation, ephemeral content, anonymity enabled within small groups, overall network of chats that you can hop into, follow graph, etc "Group chats do this already" is like saying phone calls/Houseparty did clubhouse already. On WA/signal you can't do hybrid private/public group chats with "stages", anonymity toggles, and there's no network being built." - [Erik Torenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg/status/1795256733910319365)

Apple’s rent-seeking and restrictions in the app store are a crime against humanity - for limiting our capacity to cooperate and coordinate - by making certain business models, dynamics, and creativity either economically untenable or outright illegal.

I have a dream - section about what humanity could be

The infinite game by definition is one that is not self-terminating - how do we steer civilization?

In the end, it is all about love and consciousness

"The Next Buddha will be a Sangha" – Thich Nhat Hanh
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha

The more you amplify the signals that prove themselves throughout time - the more elite you’ll be

Separating substance from presentation

How do we implement a parallel self-sustaining system with something like tenure?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Trust_network
trust network - choose what to trust depending on the trust network that is X number of hops away from you (starting from you)

The cognitive elite rejects the Zuck algo feed

Accountability begets competition

Let humanity tell its story

What if a company hires only people who either have kids or explicitly state they want to have - promoting longer-term alignment to humanity?

Due to the opacity of corporations we don’t have a good idea how important different open source projects are - we can’t perfectly gauge their usefulness/utility - and thus can’t estimate their degree of underfunding

Why can’t we define groups of people for reels - why do we have to have all of them for everyone we follow clumped - what if we could compartmentalise that?

The underclass of the future would be those that compete for status exclusively through material possessions and showing off

What if we could retroactively penalise all accounts related to a scam? And we could define the relation - merely amplifying/spreading it or being part of the core group that first started it.

If you’re amazed by what emerges out of the interconnectivity of billions of neurons - wait till you see what billions of optimally integrated and fully aligned conscious brains can do.

We can bribe/nudge with status the most successful to share and lecture about their ways of success and not just pass on the baton within their own families. Imagine being one of the few executives who’s not contributed to the commons and have that explicitly visible.

Gradually more and more signal generated by GB AIs (that’s been approved and recognised by lots of high-ranking identities) will be used when training them - a flywheel for gradual AI takeover. And that (that we’re feeding AI output as its training input) is not bad - it’s a form of memory of what has probably been proven correct and liked by us.

How do we implement the useful capacity of feelings in the GB? Pain? Hunger? Thirst? Anxiety? Signals that you’ve diverged from homeostasis. We could individually signal what the GB out to feel and aggregate that and we could define the aggregation function and its data processing any way we like - we could use other signals as proxies and indicators and infer what the feelings ought to be - without the need for explicit expression.
And how would the multiple personalities of the GB (different sets of identities with different weights) feel?


Principle by Dave Snowden: if you can’t agree on it - break it down until you can agree - reach the right level of granularity

Nobody is even close to realizing the full potential of the Internet and humanity

The market is a centuries old innovation in collective intelligence and self-organization - let’s surpass it


Yuval noah harrari talks about the growing number of useless humans as more and more gets automated away and they are no longer necessary economically or are incapable of contributing economically - few people have had the guts to openly talk about that. But what if we could design a system where there were no such people?

Collective intelligence is not just about superior cognitive results - it is also about coherence and getting everybody to understand the goals and rules and constraints and processes

A system that produces/delivers a Joe Biden or a Trump is a hopelessly broken system

We should crowdsource our norms and then rate media against them

Chris Dixon is wrong - not read/write/own but read/write/compose
The progression from web1 to web3 is not about read => write => own
Its about read => write => compose


Reinvent capital allocation

This is the greatest story ever told

If we crowdsource and rank a list of threats and necessities legitimately then anyone not being concerned with them is simply irresponsible

Gamify enculturation
Deliberate and participatory enculturation

Instagram is evil - if one switches from the “for you” feed to the “following” feed you can no longer click on the button for DMs - for that you have to go back to the algorithmic “for you” feed that sucks you in and shows you bodybuilders and babes. How do we shame companies for such practices?

How do we rate hyperbole?

Everything is about redistribution and subsidies - companies fund unprofitable divisions with the goal of future returns. Subsidies and taxes and redistribution have a bad name only because states have had wildly suboptimal structures and have done a poor job

We need the optimal/proper marriage between taxation, redistribution and competition
And goal directedness

Unifying google photos/drive/social media

An attractor for coherence and integration

The parable about the elephant in regards to aggregation and integration

Nobody is developing open source malware and hacks. Stuxnet wasn’t developed in the open. If we make the entire economy open with the proper relationship between collaboration and competition it would be much harder for someone to work on something with scale in opacity

If we had to self-regulate crypto - how would we incentivise that founders don’t cash out unless their product actually works out?

How does one express that there should be less cultural media depicting good guys vs bad guys and more media underscoring the importance of incentives and how good actors can commit bad things without even knowing within a complex system and that there are deep patterns and interconnections to be aware of?

How do I submit a PR to deduplicate the 2 entries of the book “don’t die” by Bryan Johnson on Goodreads?

We can rank the non-zero-sum-ness of endeavours and feed that into other rankings

Open source economics
Open source sociality

Or the final solution - the meta solution

We need to facilitate a war of ideas within our heads - to not hold anything in certainty and update belief based on priors and etc.
We need to merge our minds with the ability to ask the global brain anything and rank each other and define the reward curves such that we incentivise the right qualities and goals.
We need people to learn to let go of opinions with certainty and level up to an epistemically bayesian model of the world and never believe in dogma

Steal the culture (john vervarke), steal the economy (me)

Nested sustainability scores - from global to local

Our public (and private) data should have a fundamental right to programmability - black box platform lock-in must end.

By my hand, platform lock-in will die

The end of history is not with 18-19th century social tech - capitalism and democracy in their current forms need a new synthesis

Sustainability-first thinking

Social systems are religions in disguise

If two jobs both have salaries of 80$k but one is about creating more addictive foods and the other is in education - do they provide equal value to society?

Imagine voting for your tribe’s anthem

Track your own process of enculturation

Imagine being able to topologically sort the concepts you’d need to learn in order to understand something (based on your current progress) and then getting the best possible educational materials - either crowdsourced or AI generated

Imagine subscribing to streams of chores or enculturation tasks from the communities you’re a part of

The ignorance of others is everyone’s problem

Tribe infrastructure

What if we made the moral high-ground more objective?

Integration is also about taking all opinions worth considering into account and not ignoring what’s inconvenient
It is also about provenance - is the link to the source of information lost or is it available as a part of the picture?
integration is about how well different parts/aspects reinforce and strengthen each other and about less contradiction and undermining of each other

we can use social incentives - not incentivising people directly, but incentivising X for some action so that his friend Y would get the reward (shown to produce big results with even small incentives) and they both know what's up - they signed up for it together and voluntarily

Multicast messages - define a filter and broadcast to a select set of identities. Then the recipients can in turn filter the incoming messages based in upvotes for example

“How/why is this relevant to me?”

Identity is bigger than money and markets - it is our soul

What if we could ask the Global Brain “why” about any topic and get an answer we could comprehend - suited to our level of understanding?

The meta crisis is a crisis of relationality

Boycotting anything opaque - transparency is a prerequisite for alignment

Instead of fact databases - calculate the distance between the opinions of a select group of accounts and what you’re evaluating
Input sets - instead of fact databases?

Alignment is all about conscious/intentional design of cooperative evolutionary landscapes

Collectively we are psychologically ill - there is no coherence - we can’t agree on big important probable truths - its like schizophrenia

Multidimensional weights

Religion as a participatory, binding, and coherence-building process

Competition & cooperation - in & yan

Reputationalism - after capitalism

Whenever an alpha predator is established, an evolutionary niche for something to eat it emerges. Capitalism in its current form is the current alpha predator.

define your information sink along with its filters - what reaches your consciousness and how you filter and interpret any event from the real world

Incentives: Leader boards, voting power, recommender boost, !!! AND !!! claim over common pools of funds



Computational society

We can participate in tuning the parameters of the societal attractor

The early investors will forever be enshrined in the hall of fame in investing/forecasting where the wind is blowing 

Religions are domes/bubbles/membranes of coherence and alignment within collectives. Participatory religion

The ultimate market

A new religion has to outcompete, swallow and integrate christianity, islam, and science

With AGI you can simulate a plausible version of the rest of the world and cut countries off from the internet without them even knowing

We’re carbon from the cores of stars that has been shuffled around and endlessly recycled by evolution since the dawn of time - we are the universe experiencing itself

We all want to be loved

Universal income does not have to be basic - it can be multidimentional - our cogngition and RR points that we should distribute

We’re all distributors of incentive points - harnessing of intelligence through alignment

Each of us is the universe experiencing itself along its ascent in the hierarchical complexification towards greater and greater scales of cooperation and evolvability - of alignment (religion) and cognition

Isn’t intellect the capability of a specific aspect of cognition?

We can have universal prediction points

Imagine playing in a node editor with society’s generator functions and parameters and being able to simulate what it would have been vs what actually happened - we need to create expertise we can trust
Scaling of trust minisizes friction

The race of the 21st century is for the singularity and is between collective intelligence & alignment and AGI

The most probable path for true AGI is to ally with some humans and use us against each other initially
We need an alignment system on top of which we’ll all merge with the AGI


The TTPP - the truth to power protocol

We need to collectively tune our parameters about how the world works just like babies learn when young

Membranes - how do we culturally solve the problems with pornography - what should be the rules of engagement with it?

We need to crowdsource and democratize our collective app store

We need to think of education as memetic intergenerational flows throughout society - how we pass the baton should be the central goal of life of anyone

How do we continually answer each new pressing problem as best as possible forever and ever into the future?

We are universal problem solvers - we are the singularity in evolution

There’s a new status game in town

We need to patreonize the economy - start distributing funds the way we think is correct according to a public set of principles and values

How to guide and harness the complete curiosity of children democratically
How do we think about human psychology?

Where is the collective vertical slider about how much sugar we want to be imported to our country in products

We need to speed up the time from point of discovery to dissemination to all affected parties

Parenting is about helping a mind realize whats relevant for the most meta principles of the world so that the kid can later better make more aligned and optimal prediction models of the world

We need a betting market for truth - we need to all specialize in the sensemaking of different verticals of society and simoly get the best for everything

Science works most in trust and objectivity and fairness


Time-restricted stories are an addiction mechanism - if you want to see everything from someone you have to open the app every day

The purpose of life is to give birth to something better than you

We can vote on which coalitions will do beat and we can calculate the difference between them and the losers

"The language of interrelationality"
Interpersonality
> "My language is the sum total of myself." - [Charles S. Peirce](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1369470-my-language-is-the-sum-total-of-myself)


Reparations should be a form of global subsidy

We need a system to trust for most of pur sensemaking - we need to crowdsource our interpersonal protocols and norms

Intra-organizational competition - forkability of any component

If there’s no point in creating a full fledged competitor of a corporation and all effort and innovation is directed in one organization - wouldn’t that reduce the marketing budget for that company?
Transparency also builds trust and thus less need for PR

Approval points - recognition

Relevancism
Relevance economics
Relevance is the highest good in intelligence and agency

There is no higher moral ground to stand on than supporting this vision.

Capitalistically outcompeting capitalism from within

At this moment on our developmental path, the most important thing to work on is our social system together with governance and incentives. In the future that might not be the case, but at this point in time it just is - nothing is more pressing and consequential than it

“Fully aligned/cooperative/coordinated meaningful communism”

We can define import taxes for things outside of GameA and we could track those things through debit cards

One thing this document has going for it is that it’s incredibly more consistent than the bible, has more insight, is grounded in reality, and is potentially more consequential.

We’ve always had tickets to eternity whether we want to or not and whether we realize it or not - often without realizing it. The actions of anyone matter - no matter how small

We can offer a hand even to the most corrupt and evil entities from GameA - offering status in return of publicly vowing to try to shift the organisations they’re a part of

Egalitarianism: “the best place to store food is in your neighbour’s stomach”

Referral “links” - if a convert is deemed valuable/aligned/well behaved then whoever attracted them gains status


We can reduce the reputation of identities that have participated in conversations or topics or subreddits - and we can vote on by how much - computed stigma/tabboo

Argumentative voting - arguments attached to votes

We need to invert the current scaling laws of cooperation/coordination - right now smaller groups can outmanoeuvre larger ones - we need to make it so the larger the group - the better the collective intelligence and decision making
We need an attractor with an inverted law of cooperation/coordination
We need the network effect of cooperation and coordination - the complete harnessing of specialisation and cognition - where strength is in the numbers not just in terms of liability but also in capability
Alignment & coherence

A protocol as the kernel of cooperation

The division of power should not be about the 2-3 branches of government but about compartmentalized competency & legitimacy in different areas



Sectoral currency
A sectoral currency is a form of complementary currency that is restricted to a specific sector. Examples of sectoral currency are the Saber, which is restricted to the educational sector and thus can only be used to buy education, and the Fureai kippu, which is restricted to the health care sector.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectoral_currency
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fureai_kippu


We need to re-economize attention properly

What if we could all stick events on the same galactic timeline and filter them and replay them and even browse the future however we want?

Rethinking scarcity engineering
Reengineering scarcity

The Integranet

When we collectively rank the importance of items we’ll be able to see what is being omitted by whom and we can judge others based on the omissions


The singularity is conscious integration

Turbocharging cultural evolution

We’re terrified/intimidated by the uncertainty of existence and we latch onto any source of comfort and certainty - we conform - we want to fit in. Existence is tough and scary - we all want security

Our top predictors should be celebrities

How do we collectively update our priors - the whole of humanity?

This book is about consciously optimizing memes and is itself a meme that’s aiming at taking over - a meta meme - a meme about memetics. Self-reference - humanity is also a strange loop

Those who can understand this book will be converted after the first reading, and after the second they’ll have a good grasp of most aspects of it - it’s a one-way street

Competition works best when players are judged objectively through reason

How do we enable and encourage people to become the best possible version of themselves?

The point of life is to witness things together and go “Hey! Did you see that?! Yea, yea I did!”

We want to belong and to be loved - both about connecting and relating to something other than ourselves
We want to be good and we are to the degree of the good that we’ve experienced from our environment

There is no greater goal than optimizing humanity and being a scientist in the great canvas of history


AGI alignment (with humans) and human alignment are mostly the same problem

Who are the PhDs working on the problem of organizing civilization?

We can track the reputation of indexes that are organizing the web - they can commit to a view at a certain point in time and later on someone can claim that what they were serving is way off and we can transparently adjudicate that and trust our compressors of knowledge - this is an optimistic scheme

Funds will be directed towards handling crisis - how that direction happens should be of concern to all - redistribution of rewards is the most meta goal there is - we need to decide as a society what we want to reward - with our points and our money

In what aspects should we all be alike?

We have innate morality - all we have to do is integrate it properly

“How would you allocate these funds for maximal impact?” - crowdsource that and rank based on identities

We can vote on how we generate relevance templates - what the rules of the game are




If we don’t get our shit together and figure out proper governance and alignment it could all have been for nothing - billions of years of evolution and struggle for survival and sacrifice and beauty and love and freak chances could all culminate into a big pile of nothing

If there ever is/was such a thing as a meaning of life - it would be on the other side of our current evolutionary bottleneck of sustainability and planetary alignment & consciousness

The Metaverse is the commonality/intersection of all the sub-verses of the GB - it is the common infrastructure for expression and relation

Differences in an open ecosystem:
- you won’t be able to remove a follower of yours for your public stuff

Intelligent design is not about the past but about the future.

In a sane system you wouldn’t get Kamala regulating AI.

The incentivised topologically sorted global problem Kanban

We can collectively give rise to a brand new kind of information structure that would represent a complete discontinuity of our capacity for cooperation and coordination and alignment

Pledge to give 99% of your ownership back into the coffers of the coorperative within 20 years

The right side of history is after the genesis block on headjack

What if we could define the rules for what the Met Gala should look like so that only the most creative end up meeting - and not just any celebrity? Or what if we could vote for who we’d want to go meet for a week?

What if we could explicitly state which mental models we’ve learned and how we’ve equipped our cognitive toolkit? And what if we could express what we think everyone else should also learn?


How do we better formulate our problems?

How do we make the best companion for consciousness?

What if we instead of gdp decided what we’d value? How to steer the ship?

What is the other metric we should all worship?

The ultimate sidekick

Event Reinterpretability

Imagine browsing the causal map pf the metacrisis in layers - psychologically, economically, environmentally - which are the important components and how are they linked

When someone with a high status builds upon (or at least signal-boosts or approves) the work of someone with a low status - the resulting work can inherit the status of the last interaction - and thus we can imbue/associate stigmergic actions with status

What if we could view the alignment of the financial incentives of anyone towards us as a hostility score?

Computational accountability

Integration is also about common knowledge and making it explicit and reducing friction

The capacity and range for feelings and emotions increase with the increase of self-awareness.

we can pit subgroups against subgroups to compete over who would do better for the global collective goals

this is bigger than religion, capitalism, communism, democracy, or economics - this is all of them

we'll be able to send links to queries - not just the URI of a node but also what relevance templates and rules and indexes to load and use to construct the view

solving the entire category of multipolar traps

debate moderators

We need to normalise, shape, direct & incentivise defection towards error correction


From arbitrary to quantitative labels - instead of simply being called something by someone biased and with an agenda it can be objectively quantified how much that label applies to you
“Far right” (or left) wouldn’t stick that easily where inappropriate

If we get the truth machine right everything else will fall into its place

Each and everyone of us is a wave of experience and a perspective of integration - how do we sync up and enter into resonance better?

What if consequences for being wrong scales with influence?

"Dar al-Islam" and "Dar al-Kufr" are terms used in Islamic jurisprudence to divide the world into two spheres: the "House of Islam" and the "House of Disbelief" (or "House of War"). Dar al-Islam refers to territories where Muslim rule and Islamic law prevail, while Dar al-Kufr (also sometimes called Dar al-Harb) refers to territories where non-Islamic rule and laws are dominant. 

Voluntary/invitation leadership

Any kind of curation is relevance realization. YouTube is a treasure trove of learning materials but the search is absolute shit - we can crowdsource a ranking overlay/index of recommendations on top of it or in parallel

A single inbox for all DMs & email-like communication is easy to program and tune

Fund allocation: imagine giving something like tenure for a few years to the top 500 students each year instead of them wasting decades of their most productive lives not going after what they find most interesting or promising

we can verifiably prove that we got sent a cold message and label it as spam - we can crowdsource shaming of spam sources

Retroactive back-propagation of status
Giving more weight to better predictors ~ hebbian learning

If we legitimately trusted what society wants most of us - we would aim at satisfying that

Common weights as a democratic Schelling point - due to energetic, computational, and complexity constraints - the base model of humanity

Alignment is here - it's just not evenly distributed

We can collectively value how much we value something - we need the optimal fund allocation - the ultimate state - a nested hierarchy of “companies”

The system that more optimally processes information and solves problems quicker will win.

The extent to which we implement consequence capture is the extent to which we will secure a future and minimize risks

Depending on our reputation we could have visibility booster credits for ideas we really want our community to pay attention to - such signalling should be costly and rare but yet available

We can have a parameter for how many of the top people in a field need to be notified for an event - we could tune that in order to prevent overwhelm of information. High-priority events can use a bigger value. We can randomize the people to which it is sent

Misaligned capitalism on a global level is a pressure cooker - we need a valve to release the pressure before a bust

We can filter sources transitively - if some identities that are behind a publication raise red flags - that red flag could be associated with the publication

The bigger and more synergistic the vision - the higher the chance for any one of its elements/components seeing the light of day and crossing the valley of viability

How do we eliminate or at least reduce manufactured demand?

GameB will outcompete GameA even from within - despite paying an income tax to GameA - GameB will burst out of GameA

This would be the lifeboat system that humanity needs - a system of incentives that knocks down as many problems as possible - true alignment

There is an evolutionary niche for something to beat it at its own game - a better system

We have to become competently conscious of the fact that we can end ourselves through stupidity and ignorance

How do we involve everyone in civilization building?

The Arctic digital vault will be a copy of the addressable space of the global brain - access to its internal state - as a cultural & epistemic snapshot

The most intelligent thing to do is to truly align yourself with others.

Compassion is about scaling alignment - enlarging the self - a broader view

Imagine starting as early as possible to compete with your generation for status by leveraging the best information that humanity can currently offer

This idea is not inherently misaligned with the current American elite because they can be the first to move to the moral high ground and retain their status by helping build a better system at the cost of some (most?) of their resources and wealth - this would be a voluntary wealth distribution.

Elon missed the mark
He didn’t truly go for the thing of the highest impact - he is a product of his time. The Elon of post-Bitcoin would have worked on decentralized identity & media for collective intelligence and alignment and a fundamentally new global system

There can be a flag if a text post has been annotated by someone with structured data - as a quick filter for as-yet-to-be-annotated content. There can be many competing annotations.





Sex runs the world - but what if instead of showing tits and asses next to every conceivable thing in advertising the sex that actually does the selecting starts consciously selecting for better and more aligned & synergistic competition?

There is no replacement for the sense of belonging, purpose and recognition/appreciation

Star citizen has raised almost a billion selling ships - surely the global brain could beat that

I should be able to link a list of books I want to read (which I can share) with a bookmarks folder

what if we defined "clean money" that's been earned in the open after surviving all scrutiny and what if there was pressure for companies to start requesting more of their income to come from such clean money?


Synergetic escape velocity - aspects that would work very hard separately have a much higher chance of working if paired with other aspects like them synergetically

Synergetic escape velocity is lower than the escape velocity of any one of the individual elements.
The whole is more than the sum of its parts
Escape velocity or network effects

The current state of politics and governance can best be characterized by ignorance, incompetence, lack of accountability, misalignment, selfishness, manipulation & short-sightedness

Companies are centrally planned economies

Reviving/reinventing the giving pledge

Facebook succeeded instead of Myspace in part because it started with a Harvard network. Well here anyone can choose what defines an elite network

How do we deal with chronic, long-term, diffuse, cumulative and non-attributable harm?

In order to minimize surprise for any one individual we need to share our model of the world and make it common - a shared worldview and language and commitments




How many people play mindless games on their phones and how could that be harnessed?

Nothing is more virtuous than objectively helping humanity succeed. This is the last status game we’d have to ever design/play

What if scientists (or anyone for that matter) could get reputation for being early backers of ideas which aren’t theirs?

You can’t make sense of information well if you cant judge the reputation of the source of it well

The search of the future will be for identities and sources according to objective criteria/filtering
The future of search is being able to select & filter the identities used as sources of information judged objectively against criteria - todo fix wording, track record, competence, recognition

Suppose you stumble upon a Myers Briggs psychology test online - wouldn’t it be neat if you had a link directly to a page about the test itself and the opinions of anyone that you could explore?

Truth must become the Schelling point

Capitalism, money, markets. & laws:
When all you have is a hammer then everything looks like a nail

think about how the material of RethinkX would fit in this epistemological ecosystem

delegating your vote to someone that you agree with can be more impactful than voting directly because it elevates them and their arguments and narrows down the set of arguments for a debate - making things more manageable

social norms are the most powerful mechanism to leverage change

"Cooperation & transparency" as the One Commandment

This is how the internet is turned into a neural net

just like Data Availability layers allow for higher-level modular blockchain forking without much infrastructure hassle, the same way communities can fork with different models that treat & interpret the same set of events differently

Internet 2.0 is a global neural net centered around identity

Integrated information processing

Social media 1.0 was designed for consumption - what if we designed it for expressivity, meaning, creation, collaboration and epistemic coherence & compounding?

We can publicly entice/bribe corporations with greater memetic distribution to align with our goals

Objective reputation has to be a cornerstone


Radical markets for names?

Money is under the control of misaligned, corrupt, dysfunctional and incompetent governments and banks. Status is under the control of media and money. We can redesign status as a new type of flexible currency thats evolvable to whatever we need it to be

What if we obsoleted the money-on-money-return game in favor of status-on-status-return built on top of competence, accountability and cooperation - the infinite game, not one bound to resources?

The internet & the digital in their final form as a memetic evolutionary substrate - no architectural restrictions

One of the dials could be status vs virality of an event as a spectrum

the only enemy is entropy

separate "severity/importance" and "likelihood", so that we can weight in on these 2 aspects separately

resiliency! can survive internet partitioning like the Chinese firewall if the chain is only on one end - data can be created & made addressable by an application on one side of the internet, then they sign a transaction to anchor the data to the chain, then that anchoring transaction and all the data can be physically moved on some storage device to the other part of the internet & the anchoring transaction can be submitted - now both sides can address the same events the same way. Just like IPFS.

we can vote and agree on what is acceptable and what is not - a big taxonomy of unacceptability - and then use that shared standard to rank online actions

2 notifications? Show only one and save the other for later! pure evil... some apps do this...
Are the apps working for you?
We need to put the humans first

Collectively programming humanity

We need to take back control over how the epistemic sausage is made

The terms of the debt jubilee will be dictated by the global brain

A socially wired global neural network

the race to the top on transparency

One commandment: epistemic health

Whistleblowing should pay

the fundamental axiom: most people are good
The one commandment: most people are good
Why don’t we derive everything from “most people are good?”
Everytyning is rooted on this one key assumption: most people are good
Also that everyone should bear responsibility
We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?


Bashing utopias as unrealistic and dangerous by pointing to epistemologically bankrupt historic examples that lead to catastrophes is a limiting & self-manifesting/reinforcing belief
It also lacks any imagination and attempt for creativity

The belief that utopian visions are dangerous is a dangerous belief

Turning the other cheek is a metaphor for escaping the dictates of your immediate impulses and motivations. Resisting temptation - the evolutionarily installed impulses that were useful in past evolution.
We need to learn from religious movements and apply the insights to a materialistic worldview

This is the Manhattan project for reclaiming our consciousness

We can score a NYT piece on a multitude of factors - bias, clickbaity-ness, not presenting the full picture, loaded language, missing citations

What if we treated media like science - requiring citations and quotes for everything?

epistemic crisis - a crisis of knowledge

despite the overwhelming amounts of information available to us - we are more polarized than ever and it is harder to separate fact from fiction

What about the Fermi paradox? Perhaps life everywhere else couldn’t build the global brain.

Motivated reasoning should be abolished/countered/made visible

We can reward pre-commitments how data will be treated

Think of how current services (science journals, stack exchange websites) can make it so the reputation of someone can be linked to their identity of choice & made addressable & exportable so that it can be fed into models

People are conditioned into passivity, cynicism and helplessness

A distributed and participatory social landscape

A participatory social operating system

The lack of shared intentionality - a shared worldview - is perhaps our fundamental issue

Some of the quotes in this book are probably misattributed - wouldn't it be nice to be able to cryptographically prove their provenance by quoting a part of the source text linked to identity?

btw още няколко неща които ще може да се правят ако експрес-ваме семантично идеите - освен да се изчисли score спрямо някакъв модел/правила и някаква база данни от "факти", ще може човек сам да си дебъг-ва мислите като търси логически конфликти, и ще може да прави diff спрямо идеите на някой друг - да види % препокриване и съгласие (както и конфликт).
и ще може да query-ваш кои други имат еди какво си мнение

we can have tribunals for claims of corruption and reward journalists & investigators who correctly (according to a tribunal of our choice) map such instances in the real world to entities

Unification of entities/concepts/events and the ability to aggregate and open access to freely compose, associate and extend the data and functionality are a way to fix asymmetries of power

Levels of openness & alignment - different rewards by the network

imagine if the insights and conclusions of any book or long-form media were encoded in the giant epistemological graph and you could see which parts of the world are affected, where there is consensus/conflict, etc.

what if the whole system recalculates everything automatically when a fact (assumption) changes and based on specific criteria sends appropriate notifications - showing a diff & implications of the changes?
What if a core fundamental assumption you have gets overturned - wouldn't you want to know the transitive impact of that change?

Examples for feeds: 1) friends, 2) interests (and for different interests - finance/hobbies), 3) groups







relevance presets - fixing a problem vs practical tips how to circumvent it and/or live with it - depending on your goals - policy maker vs researcher vs citizen
also could be applied to different aspects/layers - like security/sustainability/competitiveness




Parameterized multi-dimensional participatory constitution

People despair when hearing about the generator functions of our problems because they seem intractable but our system boils down to how we coordinate & cooperate, what’s our common knowledge and how we do collective intelligence - we absolutely can change our system fundamentally

How many people don’t want to found/run a company or would be bad at it but have an idea for improvement in an industry - and have no way to improve the world unless they start a new competitor from the ground up?

Our ignorance and selfishness will be judged harshly by future generations - the question is to what degree of harshness. We are in progress of potentially wiping off millions of years of progress

What if you gained a % of the likes of something you liked before others?

Not everyone has to compete for status and prestige, but merely participating or using this system is legitimizing a more transparent, fair, and efficient system with objective rules

The GB will signal what kinds of specializations (competencies) are needed and also how many such neurons are needed for the volume of the task by assigning different amounts of prestige to the different needs. Entities that specialize will effectively be learning to recognize different types of patterns. The internal prestige economics will be guided consciously in service to the goals of the system.

Hoarding resources unnecessarily for private gain is immoral

The three pillars: bayes, CC & RR
BCR
One can go a long way only with BCR
The physics of complex life

The 3 biggest questions
We are failing on what is true, what is moral and what is relevant (prioritization).

Make up a global consciousness day - a day when we all have to have had perfect sleep

The algorithm for aggregate communication

We need to create our global court for adjudication

In memory of aaron schwartz

The number one thing is knowledge transfer - at school, at work and in life

What if we could collectively steer the development of a film?

How could we steer only through culture our birth rates globally

The physics of life: flows, redistribution and incentive design

How do we reduce rent seeking?

Write about what we could turn the amazon into

Why we should seek truth as much as possible
Give example how we could solve any problem - or how we could discuss IQ

We only get one life - how could each of us best spend it?

The ultimate purpose of life is to try to raise as many others as possible from their misery

Lets outdo tenachtitlan - lets build a disease-free paradise in the amazon - but that requires an amazon to still be there

How do we become better versions of ourself?

Flow - as a chapter about incentives





there are no secret laws. We should be able to work on them in public, transparently and accountably

Status economics

We can reward companies when they contribute private data to the public commons
Power is with the people to vote how to score entities - not with infra providers and applications which want more advertising dollars and have a conflict of interest

We need to gamify the contribution to a coherent and unified knowledge base 

Concepts and events are singular and unique, opinions are subjective and multi-perspectival

What is our civilizational objective function?

Rejecting the rule of hypocrites and psychopaths is moral

Society has a balance sheet - lets crowdsource it


People are used to and reduced to passive consumption - recommendation engines

structurally removing the capacity for corruption through technology

a causal map can reveal the fundamental generator functions of our biggest problems

identify perverse incentives, multipolar traps, coordination failures, and destructive competition

society's signal amplification method is broken

signaling at different scales - locally, nationally, globally - trying to tell different things to different group sizes

The elephant in the room is human alignment



Bitcoin and appchains (the first wave) vs ethereum & fully programmable chains (& even modular designs)
Analogy: all the different social media apps vs a unified identity layer and permissionless composability. This is the final abstraction


If the left and right really dont want to share the same town hall - they can have two different models for the state (built from the events)

What an open identity layer lacks in control over product and customer experience, it makes up for with permissionless composability, reusing the same social graph and efficiency UNIX-style 

concern/challenge: recalculating the state from past events based on different criteria will become more costly as time goes by - leading to ossification and inertia in changing the rules. Perhaps it should be done with a sliding window

Just because everybody can be a writer on public blockchains doesn’t mean that they should

Family/Community accounts? Dad/CEO owns the account of children/employees and can move them to a different IDM in a single tx? But what about the metadata leak?


We need to show all the ways we and information are interconnected - drawing interest for anyone. We should be able to easily query “how relevant is this to my network, and how”

We all have opinions what we should teach our kids for example - among an endless list of realmlife issues

the multi-perspective guide to life






We need to cohere around what we should do as a civilisation - using the scientific method every step of the way 

What should we do as a civilisation? We should teach our kids the general principles that would help them self-actualize and we should have a causal map of the world along with the best possible training materials for any field - so kids can choose their direction

Fractal knowledge - zoom however much you want to go deeper

Error correction, conscious evolution, scientific method

The essence of spirituality and transcendence is the feeling of being a part of something greater than one self. We can feel the calling of evolution’s arrow towards greater levels of aggregation and cooperation

The only competition we should be engaged in should be in the pursuit of doing things and serving others better - not owning more just for the sake of owning and feeding the ego

A ruthless pursuit of excellence in the service to others

We need to ground our civilization on the pursuit of truth

Error correction is the noblest of pursuits


Consequence capture is imperative for humanity


we need to rebuild our civilization around consequence capture
our civilization needs to gradually morph into one that has consequence capture as a foundation

money and markets are about the transfer of energy (ownership) and are an informational layer of humanity. Reputation, status and knowledge are a complementary informational layer for our global superorganism and they are much more flexible and with higher leverage - a simple idea can transform us and that has happened countless times throughout history
With money and resources the laws of energy conservation play at hand, even though economic growth lifts everybody up through the voluntary transactions of participants. Knowledge is the superior layer.


we need to answer questions such as who should we listen to and who should govern us

modeling objective reality

knowledge and information are the true manifestations of post-scarcity - in the material world we will never reach post-scarcity with our evolutionary paleolithic psychology

Surfing the global brain


Headjack is a self-manifesting worldview of intentional evolution that contains its own delivery mechanism.

directional/intentional complexification

We should leave money and the transactional to be only about finite resources and property - we should build a parallel informational structure about influence - money shouldn’t get you influence

Intellect and consciousness are gifts and we are squandering them

We need to consciously brainwash humanity towards cooperation and transcendence
An elevator towards transcendence - one in which every individual needs to power themselves and do the work, but the path needs to be laid out for them through crowdsourced consensus built on competence and accountability

consequence capture, treat others the way you'd want to be treated, and error correction

This architecture is a bet that people care what others think and want to explore it

We are here to serve
By giving, we receive

Fulfillment

Facebook is an insult to humanity

We must devote ourselves to excellence

Anything less than striving to be your best version of yourself is deeply/profoundly meaningless and stupid

Washington should be obsoleted

We are failing as a species
And we are the most important one

We are all in this together
We need to look in the mirror and face that we are failing at what nature selects for - we are acting against our interests.
In order to solve the problem we must first come to terms with it

People fail at appreciating the beauty of life

> "Most underestimate the asymmetric advantage possessed by psychopaths when it comes to wielding mass manipulation in service of harnessing the human instinct toward collective agency.

We need to address meaning as a civilization

Ultimate freedom lies when consciousness isn’t burdened by the frame of the ego
That is transcendance

You feel whats most true and important because the burden of your beliefs is lifted - when the ego dissolves - thats when consciousness is free from any frame

By birthing a global conscoiusness we’d be able to ask what is most relevant

We should be able to define any kind of incentives for error correction. Any.

a blueprint for what is possible - not what will happen

We don't have a mechanism to vouch for something and have skin in the game and accountability across all industries

knowledge explorer

status incentives reputation
in some competitive games the leaderboards are reset every "season" in order to level the playing field for new entrants - this can also be leveraged in the reputation toolkit


A moral overlay for markets

We can use status and incentives to get entities to provide data availability for crucial naming or whatever metadata thats offchain and there’s room for many entities for redundancy

A single show (Queens gambit) has had a massive effect on how much chess is played - what cultural artefacts might we produce to fuel the participation into the global brain?

What if we could easily view/query/crowdsource what are the failure modes of anything?

Talking to the aggregate - an AI that can summarize the latest changes since the last time you spoke with the aggregate, the ability to query the most important or relevant aspects to you, etc.

It's preposterous to rely merely on the price signal and the invisible hand in the age of the internet and AI
It's preposterous to claim that we’re at the global optimum as an attractor

We are failing as a species to rank our problems and who is a competent leader

How to spread innovation faster - integration - what if orgs had to self-certify which latest best practices they’re following - producing a ranking - incentives

Success-based cultural learning
Kids track competence
Conformist transmission



> "Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4464-peace-cannot-be-kept-by-force-it-can-only-be)





we don't want to be going through heaps of disorganized data with search engines and indexes which resembles looking for a needle in a heystack - we want the information and knowledge to be properly interconnected in the first place so that relevance realization is more easily facilitated



We need to culturally redefine the fitness landscape - conscious cultural niche construction through collective participation and sensemaking


What if we did a topological sort of our civilizational tasks based on a few maps: 1) a causal map, 2) a dependence map, 3) a values map (importance weights), and started offering status to those that work on the most pressing issues?

How much brain power is spent developing more crunchy cereals and bubbly shampoos compared to improving our systems of governance?

Cultural evolution is the continuation of biological evolution

democracy is like an economic market where you can only buy your products once every few years and many different aspects are clumped into representatives from only a few suppliers (2 in the US). If economic markets worked like that they wouldn't be creative or efficient

vertical markets are a disaggregation of democracy - enabling evolvability of governance solutions through fine-grained competition and trial & error

If a vertical market exists, an externality is like an unmet personal need in an economic market - a profit opportunity for any enterpreneur who wants to develop an element of governance that corrects that externality in a cooperative fashion

Governance and democracy need to be unbundled - their current forms (electing representatives every few years) were conceived centuries ago because we simply couldn't have done it better back then - we need to reinvent them in the digital era.


Global consciousness can be thought of just like ours: thousands of competing signals for our conscious attention (our global workspace) coming from all directions - most of which are filtered out - surfacing only the most pressing ones. We need to develop a hierarchical system that surfaces the most important signals and information.


example: what's the incentive for someone highly knowledgeable in crypto to give their opinion on a project - in order to weed out the scams and craps? 0 incentive - they'll get attacked by shills in the comments. We need to change that

an enlightened society would provide the means and steps for anyone to go up the developmental spiral and integrate the levels of understanding
spiral dynamics, ken wilber


when you open a youtube video that you've watched previously and reset your view progress - wouldn't it be cool to know if you've seen it before?


consequence capture all the way down
consequence capture is what is applied recursively through all of the levels of complexification, cooperation and emergence.




parts of the human body don't keep secrets from other parts


Complex scores - for the cases where claims cannot be calculated we can simply rely on the voting of a selected group of people


Remember: you’re peering into the collective wisdom of humanity



Competing crowdsourced ESG scores
also GDI scores (global disinformation index) which affects the pockets of media with bad scores

When you browse someone’s lists you’re basically in a one-way conversation with them - “what do you value most, what do you recommend most, etc”

Working transparently and accountably deserves status. The highest accountability level deserves status.

Google - relevance realization in the kitchen - sweet stuff is hidden in boxes by default. Why cant we design shops like that? As a “shop” template?

We can shape and define the psychology of the global brain

What if we asked the entire world every possible question uniquely and could filter out the results?

Our primary objective as a species should be recursive relevance realization and making a market for objective truth and figure out how to collectively choose 

We must make being able to understand that viewpoint the default state of our civilization

Cooperation worship

It is our responsibility to erect an elite that deserves it

If its good enough for nature, it is good enough for us. We are part of nature.

Our goal should be to come up with the best and most important education for every human and then figure out how to diffuse the gradient between the least and best educated people. Nature is intolerant of gradients (temperature, pressure, electrical charge) and neither should our culture when it comes to education. We should strive towards educational equilibrium - even though it is inherently unattainable.



This is the way to participate in the building of our civilization







Politics should be replaced by simply putting the right person at the right spot - incentivising expertise and accountability - alining incentives

What if we could collectively agree on offchain "CBDC" protocols and could collectively vote what should happen to them?

We can crowdsource and agree upon what the most fundamental concept of our civilisation should be, and why, and enforce it within there
Cooperation and education and the scientific method

Just like the CCP crafts policy papers which are then handed down to executive branches, we should crowdsource our civilisational policies and reward companies that implement them with higher ranking

We can crowdsource how the world should work and walk backwards from that until it becomes applicable to us currently

The meaning economy - how power, attention and incentives work in the global brain

Civilizational KPIs

Planning ahead for a debt jubilee

Anything that needs improvement in this new information economy will be collectively incentivised through reputation and pagerank

We should orient our lives towards building reputation that can be taken away from us by collective consensus - aligning our incentives.

We can design the incentive system for participating in constructing the worldview that should be taught to everyone

Not living your best self is hurting the whole

We can sort the expertise of any vertical and then use the best

We need to crowdsource a new manager (as from john’s work) for the next step of our civilisation

Imagine the multidimentional oscars where any overlapping subset of people can vote differently - and all that in public. What different cohorts think, and what the cohort with the highest predictive capacity and competence and achievement ranks highest.


What if it becomes a competitive advantage for companies to allow their employees to export and prove their competence from their work there? Opening the gates for those that want to work in public and transparently


This is the real neuralink - the real way we link our minds

We should crowdsource the best possible guide to being a human

Our technical capability is growing exponentially while our capacity to make sense of the exponentially increasing complexity of the world is diminishing - this runs off a cliff
our information ecology is increasingly more broken
https://youtu.be/nQRzxEobWco?t=247

imagine being able to subscribe to better metaphors for concepts you care about - metaphors that better get those ideas across to others. "Let me know when a more effective way of communicating this idea comes up"

In biology, within an organism, different organs or cells don't try to hide information from others - there is absolute transparency - even if signals don't traverse from end to end (most of the times it doesn't make sense)

> "Social capital is a concept used in sociology and economics to define networks of relationships which are productive towards advancing the goals of individuals and groups. It involves the effective functioning of social groups through interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of identity, a shared understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity." - [Social capital, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital)


we need a power structure that is inherently trusted and legitimized by competency, accountability, transparency, and participation.

Global Brain Specialists are the future of consulting.

According to an ideal internet bill of rights, today's social media giants would be in violation as we can't freely associate and assemble - we don't truly own our data and there's no such thing as permissionless innovation.

Division of labor for the moderation and proper tagging with an incentive reputation for the exchange of time

We need to give the best possible education to everyone in the world - especially the disadvantaged

We need to change how we give status

We can make contributing a status thing

We can have a vote on how to rank votes for any type of other voting - effectively how do we give different kinds of status and how much do we value it

We can vote on the type of cbdc we would want

This is the booting of a network state where status is computable over track record and accountability and competence

The first and forever biggest network state that engulfs the rest will be the meta global governance layer based on transparency, accountability and competence

The concern with global government is that it could cement the status quo of broken incentives and misalignment

The people dont want the current power structures to be cemented and because of the fear of the slippery slope to tyranny we reject globalisation

We need a market for transparency and accountability. On the record

We are grossly underestimating or completely ignorant of the level of interconnectedness, feedback loops and unpredicted/undesirable/surprising second/third/fourth/…-order effects in the biosphere. Here are two scary words: tipping point.

AIs can be the main labellers of sentiment and whether someone is following the code of conduct - of course mislabelling can be challenged. The key here is that the cumulative rating would affect identities - it will not be a single threshold that they’d have to worry about but about all of their behaviour.

What if women could define in different ways what high prestige and status is for them and we could see the evolution of that in public - whether it would drift towards pro-sociality? It probably would. Also currently there’s no way for the demand (women seeking men to pair up with) to aggregate and start consciously directing what they as a whole value more - and we’re left with competing with money and exuberance

We need the best system to lift people out of ignorance - the war on ignorance instead of on poverty

We need the best possible education for anything, the most logical incentive system for collective good, and to guarantee access to every child on earth the best possible healthcare and nutrition

What our kids value in the world and the way it all goes - that’s our shadow after death - we’re here merely to give a push to life forward - the only thing that’s worth anything at all.

Only life can value anything. Value life

We need to consciously seek to become better parents - how we raise the kids is the ultimate trajectory

The more important something is, the more we reward good-faith actors - builders of the common knowledge

Justify yourself - show me what you’ve got

The global justification arena

Just like bryan we need to measure every organ (institution) and try to make that optimal for everyone.

This is capitalism’s offramp

on decentralization/individuation and centralization/integration and how parts relate (and communicate) to each other and the whole (holoscopy) - related to synergy (& top-down/bottom-up?)

> "In this hour of death, the blockchain itself holds within it an intrinsic logic that carries forward the spirit of liberal democracy and sane discourse: a reference system of independent verification, falsification, or review. This is the principle of science, of enlightenment, of public discourse, and ultimately of freedom. Blockchain is where all parts together verify the whole, which in turn evolves the meaning and value of the parts. It’s a direct continuation of the principle of finding truth together, where truth is a moving target, an exploration. As such, blockchain has the potential to update and defend this principle of truth-seeking against the forces of entropy.
>
> ... decentralization is not made possible by the removal of centralization, but by transformations of the forms that centralization can take...
>
> **1. From decentralization to the dance of individuation and integration**
>
> ... we may exchange “decentralization” with “individuation” and “centralization” with “integration”... we wish this differentiation or individuation to progress as far as possible, as the specialization of one becomes the relative wealth of another, which equals a growth in capacity for the whole.
>
> The centralizing counter-pole represents, in turn, the integrative aspect of the ecosystem. Which is to say that the farther this pole is extended—without it collapsing and oppressing its opposite (individuation)—the more utility is garnered by the emergence of a higher number of more mutually unique but complementary agents. Simply stated: the more numerous and different the parts, the better they have to be able to t together in order to help rather than bother each other.
>
> So “values work” is the answer, right? Make sure they share an ideology or religion? That will make the many different agents work towards the same greater whole, won’t it? Not so fast. Only emphasizing shared values or commitments of loyalty or solidarity
will not suffice to keep the ecosystem coherent beyond the point of a fairly crude division of labor... A more complex society, with more composite and complex agents, requires deeper and stronger forces of integration. The decentralizer that misses this point will end up adding harm to injury.
>
> But not any old form of centralization will do. Today, as we have seen, this inherent need for integration in a world so wildly and rapidly individuating into so many projects and teams leads to a default setting of increasing centralization across the board, which further fuels the disintegration of liberal and democratic processes of communication and the economy. And ultimately, world politics and global culture.
>
> What needs to happen instead is that blockchain ecosystems start very actively and deliberately building their capacity to integrate, which increases their capacity to hold and nurture higher differentiation/individuation. Such integration has many aspects, but the primary one is that it only centralizes on the highest level of abstraction possible, because that is where the greatest variety of projects can be meaningfully included and interconnected. **As such, what is centralized is not concrete decision-making, nor even the communication of a joint vision: it is the responsibility and commitment to maintain, develop, and where necessary heal, the joint capacity to understand and trust one another within a certain delineation (like a blockchain sphere)**.
>
> The centralizing agent’s key commitment is to increase **the average capacity of members to communicate effectively and honestly**. This, in turn, implies a commitment to support members’ capacity to seek reliable information about the resources available in the ecosystem, and to trust the resilience of the whole so as to unlock bolder and more playful aspects of individuation... The reward ... is not really power, glory, and riches, but a more genuine connection with other people, a more stable income, and a deeper sense of satisfaction and meaning. It also unlocks higher degrees of creativity, as you are now part of so many different contexts of highly creative projects...
>
> **2. Holoscopy**
>
> ... holoscopy. It is the capacity of the parts, respectively, on their own, to see the whole (the blockchain ecosystem). At the end of the day, if we accept that neither centralization nor decentralization are goals in and of themselves, that the collective intelligence of an ecosystem is ultimately a relational quality, and the main relationship to be qualied, operationalized, measured, and gauged, is the one between individuation/integration, then we must look for qualities that are present in many parts but common to them.
>
> ... holoscopy cannot and should not be monolithic... Instead, the whole that is viewed together must be coherent and translatatable enough across contexts to allow for cooperation and conflict mitigation or avoidance, while inspiring loosely held directions for the movement of the whole, but also non-totalizing, allowing for each person or team to have their own context, interpretation, or sense of purpose so as to optimize for their individuation of capacities and products...
>
> The problem in truly decentralized settings is not one of too monolithic and totalizing visions of the whole that are forced upon members. The problem is a deficit of holoscopic capacity for the parts. This deficit can be met by a stronger commitment to centralize certain values, assumptions, strategies of communication, forms of contract, norms of exchange, channels of communication—and, by far most importantly, certain maps of the ecosystem as a whole.
>
> Appropriate norms that arbitrate between inclusion and exclusion from the ecosystem itself should thereby not be set in terms of what function, type of project, form of agent, or skill set that an agent displays. Instead, rejected inclusion or active exclusion from the ecosystem should be defined by whether or not an agent can display sufficient understanding of the map of the ecosystem itself (who are the other players, what do they do, what are key values and what are the tensions around diverging interpretations of these, what are the key interest groups that organize in this field, what are the norms of communication, how is trust built and upheld, what is new and what is old, what is central for functioning and what is more optional). You can display diverging opinions on any of these questions, but you must be able to reasonably reproduce the answers that a central committee has suggested and agreed upon after continuous updating by consent processes of the community.
>
> To be a good part, you have to see the whole. The more others see the same whole, the more spontaneously and harmoniously they can communicate, trade, compete fairly, collaborate, and play. And that’s creation...
>
> To spur periods of sustained and relatively stable creation of a kind that is competitive with conventional global markets, key agents of an ecosystem must define and institutionalize processes that map out the whole, and that do so iteratively. They must then find ways to incentivize the learning of this map by each part of the whole. They must find ways to measure this holoscopy, to continuously improve upon its quality, and ultimately, they must set norms of exclusion for failing to display sufficient coherence with the whole. You are free, parts, but your degrees of freedom flow not from how little top-down control there is, but from how much resonance there is in relation to other parts and between all of you and the whole.
>
> ... without holoscopy there is no integration, and with no integration, decentralization does not lead to individuation but only to confusion, tension, fragmentation, dissolution—and oscillates right back to centralized and unchecked power.
>
> **3. Seizing the means of communication**
>
> The last key insight: What must be optimized for is the quality of communication... there is a general sense of direction that the means of communication, the platforms, are owned and controlled by oligarchies, whereas they instead need to function more as commons with democratic accountability if they are to increase rather than harm collective intelligence.
>
> ... the leadership of ... an ecosystem can and should design an iterative strategy for instituting clear norms of communication, cultivate wide-spreads skills of dialogue, offer channels of collective sense-making that undergird the solidity of arguments and respect for differences of perspectives and interests, and measure the quality of communication continuously, while rewarding commitment to and initiatives towards more effective communication and adjudicating or healing in cases of misunderstanding and conflict.
>
> Looking at the gold standards of established and proven communicative skill sets, one is the “non-violent communication” framework. It entails expressing emotions and feelings more clearly, focusing on the purpose of one’s statements, and asking for the same in others, while actively avoiding blame or judgment (or home-made diagnostics) of the behaviors and opinions of others. Training programs and formal qualications of communicative skills can be instituted, and these can be linked to rewards within the larger system. This can be followed up by measurements and repeated reflections upon how the culture of communication can be enriched. Professional roles in this field can include creators of dictionaries that simplify onboarding and understanding, so that tech lingo becomes more transparent; leadership in setting and updating norms of communication; inventing measures and using these to make reports back to the community; and, of course, communication trainers of teams and others. Classical moderator roles of forums and central channels of communication are also vital, as are healers and facilitators. Taken together, this sets in motion the learning curve on how to let information flow more freely and efficiently through the ecosystem. This is vital for the health of the whole, of the parts: it reinforces individuation (as each part expresses itself more clearly, also to themselves), integration (as collaboration is facilitated and stabilized), the management and prevention of tensions and conflicts, and it creates better soil for holoscopy across the board." - [The Path to Decentralization is Centralization, by Daniel Görtz](https://truthtogether.substack.com/p/the-path-to-decentralization-is-centralization)

> "**TL;DR**: Leaders of blockchain ecosystems can serve decentralization better if they concentrate on both integration and individuation, which is achieved by investing in holoscopy and communication facilitation, training, channels, protocols, and skills. Setting stronger boundaries, clearer norms, and more control around these things leads to more spontaneously self-organizing and stable growth of knowledge, innovation, and value creation. Failure to do so leaves the field open to conventional market agents, in which centralization and top-down control always win out after a few iterations, which always spills over into all aspects of society... The established counter-cultural striving towards decentralization targets a vital issue but has a too simplied model to reach its goals. A more effective model would have a fractal or “yin-yang” understanding between centralization (integration) and decentralization (individuation). **You can’t have the yin without the right kind and amount of yang. If you try to do only yin, yang wins out, and then both yin and yang die**... The world is not a struggle between centralization and decentralization. It is a struggle between:
>
> 1. lacking resonance and balance between centralization and decentralization, which brings both oppression and fragmentation, and
>
> 2. sufficient resonance between the two qualities, which brings freedom and stability.
>
> The leading edge of blockchain (and its interactions with AI) is a kind of eye of the storm of this development. It’s here, if anywhere, that the wing of a buttery can start or stop not only a storm, but the changing climate of a planet." - [The Path to Decentralization is Centralization, by Daniel Görtz](https://truthtogether.substack.com/p/the-path-to-decentralization-is-centralization)

The highest inteligence thing to do would be to organize optimally what you depend upon - your system - integration, diversification

How do we get the young to Commit in the system As much as pro gamers - those that make millions per year? Why don’t we do that but for prediction and competence and alignment?

The final stage of evolution in every level is complete and optimal cooperation

Lets define the loss function of humanity. Optimize everything into a single number

Crowdsourced insurance

Tickets to concerts - the best that money cant buy

We can define money collectively

We should say what we’d die for collectively and sort on what we are aligned

In dota everything boils down to a single outcome and we can rate the different contributors with weights

Dota is the perfect team game - the ultimate complexity

We need the olympic game of competence and alignment - the global protocol

We need to collectively evaluate and aggregate - defining our loss function

We need to think like owners and conscious architects of our system


We are far from perfectly rational & informed, we don’t start from the same place and most of our actions absolutely affect everyone else as well - individualism is a useful prism and has some truth in it but is absolutely not the full picture of how we ought to structure society - we need to take the best aspects of while recognising that it’s not the complete solution

What if there was an incentive for the creatora to own less and the early users could own a piece of the pie? … smaller upside for the enterpreneurs but higher chance of success

We can (and should) show why it’s in the best interest of everyone to lift humanity as a whole - in every regard/aspect

The same tools and algorithms will be able to run on any kind of list - bookmark folders for example (any kind of search/index for lists will apply to them as well) - the UNIX-ification of the web/cyberspace/internet

The current game is to a large extent one of hoarding and trampling over each other.

How do we optimize for self-organized criticality better? How do we better surf the edge of chaos?


We need to start funding the science we want to get done - all in public. We must weed out any corrupt incentives in determining what is true

In markets if two people make the same correct prediction about a stock but one of them operates with 10 or 100 times more capital they make that much more - even though their competency for this bet was the same - exacerbating the wealth inequality. People should be able to earn the same amount of benefit from the same successful prediction - we need to equalize this - this is where we truly need equality - this is about equality of opportunity
Or maybe we might equalize only the upside but make it so that the downside is bigger and bigger for accounts with a long track record !!!

We need to answer every question just once and in the best possible way - so that we can easily point to it anytime it comes up. Coherence.

What if we could give an account boost for anyone with a job? And so people who choose not to work currently might decide to work a bit for more status - boosting their overall number/score?
What if we gave more status to billionaires if they donated 10% (or 20?) of their wealth?
TODO: how could this backfire? they could essentially buy attentional influence with their money and make more money... Perhaps reputation should decay?
Capitalism leads to wealth concentration, (inflationary fiat money does too) but is the best form of aligning incentives and promoting risk-taking and hard work.
We can augment it (& markets) by redefining status and incentivizing generosity.
Donations shouldn't be compelled and shouldn't simply go to the ever-hungry and unaccountable/inefficient/corrupt Uncle Sam in the form of a tax ("tax the rich!!! pay your fair share!!!") - anyone should be free to direct their donation however they choose.

fact-checking billions of people doesn't scale. incentivizing the correct labeling/tagging of assertions and fact-checking assertions only once scales.

What if we could allow the greatest minds, scientists & game theorists to compete and engineer the best models for ranking humans based on their public contributions? Rewarding competency, predictive power, and adaptability (changing their minds when they're initially wrong). This can be the greatest game of all time - scoring high in the ever-evolving global ranking - where even anonymous accounts can participate. Enders game?

We can crowdsource the best legend of "how to participate and what you need to know in order to be good - statistical/bayesian thinking, etc." by checking what the highest-ranking members have suggested - like the "subreddit rules" that moderators define.

Everything Is Connected - Here's How | Tom Chi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyr4qORDu2A

We are experience itself. We are the ineffable. Life is sacred. Experience is a cosmic gift - and we trample each other - we are slaves to our primal selves
We are ok with the suffering of others - until that changes, we’ll be a miserable civilization. Until we organize ourselves optimally as a system we are failing to rise to the occasion.
We are part of the most complex system in existence - we are all connected with everything - we need to feel the connection viscerally and we need to replace gdp as our organizing metric.

We need the best story of who we are - the most accurate and comprehensible story.
Everything good must be optimized for sharing and comprehensibility

We must be eager to help others - to raise them to our level
We need to make clear what the benefits would be if we raised as much people as possible and as much as possible. We must all want the ultimate system - and we must actively participate in its creation
We must crowdsource our religion - our hierarchy and internal tax and redistribution code

Our religion will be in the book that most of us collectively read. The shared and participatory code of ethics.

Life is a game where we should have fun and try to solve problems and help others. That’s it. Laziness and selfishness are simply inadequate

We must use science properly for our common morality
Redistribution is about morality
Ot morality is about redistribution - it is about helping

If we live under the pretense that anyone and everyone can succeed - we need to make damn sure that’s possible and we need to define it and keep ourselves accountable how well we’re approaching the omega point of complete recycling and robustness - we are an organism
We need to express through and merge with it - the directionality - the promise of continual improvement and hope

Our collective dreams will be our MMOs that we participate in - with forks of our current universe where we can simulate societies and try different parameters and evolve incentives and creativity

You do ‘t really care about life if you’re not curious what it actually is - until you start digging for yourself into evolution and big historyand complecity and dissipative structures - u til then you don’t really have an informed opinion of what is life all about

We will initially be at a tax disadvantage because our participants will be taxed by states in addition to our own tax/redistribution system but we will outcompete the rest. We will tcare of our own and the services of states will be rendered obsolete 1 by 1. We will look for ways to reduce the unnecessary tax burden imposed on us by the obsolete decaying system that we are replacing.

We shall split our collective holdings in many different jurisdictions and also in many different vaults with cryptocurrency - there shall be no single point of failure.

This is the proper manifestation of an extinction rebellion - compared to the current organization in the UK

Disintegration of information, divide and conquer, frame control

We should reward super-forecasters not just for getting things right but also for helping others improve

I want to report to twitter that im annoyed that when i load the site and i see a notification number for a second and then it disappears for the next 10 seconds until the notifications can actually be browsed - forcing me to wait and spend time on the platform - how do I report this annoyance to the platform in a way such that any other reports about that get aggregated? LLMs. And we should be able to trace who was the psychology hire that suggested that to get implemented. It is put there by design.

We need to starve the current system both in resources and in purpose of existence - we need the unequivocal higher moral ground

Luxury is suicidal

Solving The alignment problem

Entire sections of the economy are working purely for the 1% to satisfy their needs of luxury.

God is always on top of the pyramid - right now it is money but it could be alignment and survival and well-being for all

We need to sort by relevance and cost topologically what capabilities we want, what standards of living, and how best to achieve this lowest bar for all

What if we vowed what lowest standard of living we would provide for the rest?

We can create the ultimate FAQ - both for legit questions and for fighting malicious and false reputation claims


Metamodernism is about creating god coming full circle from the pre-modern where god was our creator. God was always the guiding ideal - god was always the direction, but now for the first time as a species we have the capability and understanding of how to consciously guide god’s evolution - we can fuse with him
The kingdom of heaven is in having improved the collective well-being of humanity and leaving a mark in history. You are a pattern and so is the culture that’s been streamed through your consciousness - it’s your choice to leave a mark and how big it would be

Either the collective consciousness of our god emerges or we end a species or go through hell before a steady state is reached

We should make it impossible to buy your way out of certain crimes

We must all become cultural programmers

The purpose of life is to program culture - to leave a memetic mark in time

What is the microservice web of the GB?

What type of conformism would we publicly like to subscribe to? How do we signal what we want others to be?

What if our reality TV was generated from the competition for competence and prestige in any field - what if we made education about how the system works and how to win inside of it interesting and in public?

How do we motivate the right self-development and education that ought to be the neverending perpetual process of learning

SoulOS - purpose and meaning

Alasdair MacIntyre once wrote: ‘I can only answer the question “What am I to do?” if I can answer the prior question “Of what story or stories do I find myself a part?”’

God is integrated information

God is our aggregated and compressed competence that can speak to us - the system that answers every question in the world publicly

consciousness 1, 2 & 3 by Gregg



Our consciousness is a governance and coherence operator and even it is in line with the principle of subsidiarity - you cannot consciously control the functioning of your organs or cells - those functions are pushed to the lower levels.

the more responsibility and expectation is aggregated to a single individual on top of a hierarchy - the larger the likely disappointment. That's why we have a decentralized market with many industries and companies - our economy is a heterarchy, and yet out politics is a centralized hierarchy. Just like Hayek argued that the market is better than a centrally planned economy, so we're arguing that we need a true political market instead of this gross simplification and centralization

We must reinvent the financier

Literally, every single one of us will most probably die someday - mostly in the next 100 years. We are already in the history book whether we’re aware of that or not. Every single moment the choice of what to do next could potentially be an act toward utopia
But one day humanity will reach immortality for the individual

We can automate judgment through AI compression of objective rules

Fairness through AI

A memetic collective computer - we must collectively compute the answer to the universe - our purpose

We can redraw the borders - we can express how we think the borders ahould be and the arrangements for not defecting

Multi-scale status communism

We must crowdsource values and taxation laws - we need to employ our own tax man - one that’s fully aligned

How do we best nurture individuals?

What if we participated in the conscious collective crowdsourcing of TV, myths, values, and everything else?




The large idea collider

Here is why travel is good when done right - why everyone should have a right to visit other cultures

Private sufficiency and public luxury

A new economic sphere that eliminates inefficiencies such as marketing, finance, rent-seeking and others
Minimizing the cost of retraining and transition, achieving the biggest economies of scale, the highest trust and synergy, extinguishing friction

We have this all or nothing mindset and resort to the state and law enforcement for so many problems when we could culturally regulate with so much more nuance

What if we valued things in a new monetary paradigm such that there was no such thing as liquidity and therefore no liquidity crisis?

We can derive morality and then assign a valence to everything in the world according to our judgement of it is

If someone understands the mechanics and logics of the system then they’d easily trust most of it by default and have a better level of degree of certainty/conviction
We need to crowdsource the search for competence and also the reward fund for the winners weighted by contribution

How fi we create the ultimate story? The one that is most competent and fair and desired by the most possible people?

What must everybody read and understand? What is the most important set of memes and what is their most compressed yet comprehensible form?

We must collectively create global governance

One of the biggest global level failings of Science as an institution is that it has not recognized John Stewart’s ideas for the insight and relevance that they hold

Our market for ideas is broken - the wrong/broken stuff often gets to win - we must properly rank the importance of ideas, of institutions, of services and products.
Science has settled for mere mediocrity, cowardice and nihilism.

What if pervasive antibiotics causes autism? We are a decrepid civilization for allowing the mass health to worsen so much by our own collective produce - we manufacture misalignment - externalising harms is the greatest collective unconscious ain

The highest achievement for a social species is to improve its organization
The most important question is not why there is something rather than nothing, or what's the origin of life, or how evolution overcame error catastrophy, or what latest product is being influenzad by the Kardashians, or the "hard" problem of consciousness - the most important question is what our system should be as a social species, because solving that aids in solving every other problem - including Kardashian matters.


how many issues go unadressed because only a fraction of the population even thinks/knows about them and it's impossible to get them on the political platform of anyone - not because they aren't important, but because they aren't important enough and there is only so much one can fit into a political campaign? and so nothing ever changes, no awareness about them is generated, and even if everyone would agree on what should happen (or there would be a 90%+ majority), no decision gets made because the issue never gets on the table?


Wherever we turn our attention, things should improve

tallying strategy - how to count the votes

We can use reputation and incentives to solve collective action problems - the system is flexible enough to design any type of incentive
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_theory

We get more of what we reward

Earning status in public in the status machine

We organize our view with tags and lists and let others see our prism - this way the prisms will converge

Social media 1.0: crimes against complexification, sensemaking, evolvability, adaptability and self-organization
the nature of the current social platforms is that they hinder the complexification and sophistication of online society
Not having unrestricted programmatic access to the public commons is an intellectual crime.









Relevance filters

what if we could vote on a captain of the attention ship? someone who aims to illuminate the biggest problems - speaking truth to power

what if the brightest minds in game theory, mathematics and statistics could tune society in public?

We put so much effort in trying to optimise attention with the goal of extracting statistical correlations and patterns and yet we do such a bad job at directing the attention of society
The great misallocation of attention

Picture humanity in the most realistic way possible

A new relationship with information

How do we make scientists rich and famous?

This idea will also force the reimplementation of something like patreon

Imagine all the youth competing to surface the most truth to the world in the global transparency game

Imagine if instead of having to read a book like “the real antony fauci” all you had to do was look at the computed score of anthony fauci based on criteria you trust

With canonical deduplicated entries for concepts and events, reality will be harder to ignore

ranking the top concerns of humanity is like becoming aware of our discomfort - a problem well stated is half solved

a permissionless and open-ended event ecosystem around identity is a prerequisite for the global brain

human progress happens when we increase our ability to ask questions

getting structured data formats wrong isn't fatal - we can always translate old data to newer and more expressive formats. Evolvability.

imagine crowdsourcing a movie about the future we want based on our current collective values - as a snapshot in time, and redoing it once every 5 years as things progress

The ability to pattern-match any type of event

How do we make the important actually important, even if it is boring

We can have templates for concepts - how to represent them - what types of functionality layout we should want about a specific thing from the real world - what lens to use when regarding a specific type of concept/event
POSITIONAL SCARCITY !!!

If we measure everything we could simply see the best predictor for any endeavor

We can literally crowd-source how we want things to be

Crowdsource “how to win in society” with our best attempt at re-deriving everything from “be in service to others”



What if we could derive everything from “be good to others”?

“Be good to others” is the r basis for any religion in regards to morals for within the tribe - we can crowdsource the transparency machine for any organization

“This is what is most important for X” - but for anything

The purpose of life is to leave something after yourself and contribute - to be of service to others

A competence market

We can crowdsource our culture - this is the collectively chosen weights

The name of the game is optimization



How do we solve humanity’s biggest problem: how to coordinate better in order to have the best possible future


The metaverse is an mmorpg knowledge graph

How do we ender’s game the global brain and gamify it so participating is interesting?

computable identity: how many times have you shared a news story that contains deepfakes (determined later)?

social learning in regards to the complexity of ontologies and working with knowledge graphs and structured data - since it's all one big social network we'd see how others are using the tools and creating structured data - effectively teaching us how to better express ourselves

The metaverse is the augmentation of the physical with the digital

how to counteract discounting

better social technologies lower social coordination costs and reduce friction

what if you could define a notification filter for messages/connection requests/etc - anyone with above 10k followers for example

social media posts are ephemeral - they're irrelevant beyond the first couple of days (get burried with time) - they're promoted by the recommendation algorithms only for a a small amount of time as there's a constant stream of new events

hit pieces use points selectively (and its hard to gague them of truthfullness) whereas a model calculating a reputation score would take everything into account

radical interconnectedness - glancing at a blog post and being able to see which sections were quoted elsewhere, and being able to filter the "elsewhere" any way you want

The informational multiverse

Relevance realization: given the near-infinite complexity of the world, how do we intelligibly ignore irrelevant information and zero in on that which is relevant to us?

think of this as collectively writing the guide to/book of life

We need to shift from what are we against to what are we for

It will simply be better and people would shift to it as word goes around

what if we submitted algorithms along a few lines that express more complex things? the collective notebook with interactive code trying to prove stuff?

we could all collectively have a conversation through the distributed aggregate computing of all individuals



If there are no consequences for wall street playing the “short and distort” game with Tesla for a decade (including the hardest of times for them) - then we should be able to de-amplify topics and entities too. Todo: this point needs more thought

what if you want to be able to message someone (they're a contact) but you don't want to follow them on instagram because you're simply not interested in reels and them ending up in your feed and you also don't have a DM channel open with them? its engineered for engagement

we could even split our own vote like 30% from me and the rest 70% split between my delegates for this cause

We need an additional informational signal that is as robust as prices driven by markets and currently media is a failure

write about mycelium

TODO: think about labeling of naughty material and the streisand effect

what if the tags for a creator are automatically updated based on the tags for their individual posts and also ranked by occurance with a histogram?

This is the clearest manifestation of democracy and classical liberalism
careful with the word liberalism - it might not be the right thing here

structured data == AST, where language is the current intermediate representation (IR) and we can upgrade it to structured data
IR built on top of deduplicated concepts, entities and events

“The religion that is not a religion” - stolen from John

what if we could have citation graphs and ranking for anyone on any topic - not just within the scientific realm?

anonymity - ZK stuff and dating apps! DATING APPS!

Imagine having your personal jamie to pull things up

Money on money return

situational awareness - what's the relevant context - being able to view the same thing from different lenses

being wrong should have a cost

We can have competing opt-in committees of experts for health advice

meaning in life comes from connectedness, and especially being connected to something bigger than ourselves

We can crowdsource what is most important and even rank and sort the steps to get to there!!!

complete freedom to experiment in network protocols and self-assembly / self-organization

What if we could develop an opt-in social credit score that we individually determine how it gets calculated? A subjective score

a new choice-making architecture

No Recursively asking “how do we get there? What are the next steps?”

“The recursive subreddit” as a buillding block - a concept

Use a picture of a cockpit with thousands of buttons when talking about social media configurability and the config matrix

A new era of social computing
“Social computing”

The ultimate currency is time and thus also attention

Error correction scaled

We can crowdsource “a guide to life”

We can have campaigns in which we advocate for our values against those of others - in groups, and showing the progress publicly, and how the vote evolves throughout time

Its all just one big high dimensional wikipedia - a multipedia

We can crowdsource what to teach our children - skills, values, technologies
And not just children - even adults. We can collectively guide our attention to what is most meaningful

A philosophical & scientific MMORPG

Meaning in the 21st century - become competent in something, be credible and have the ability to influence stuff - and increase the weight of your vote - a weight thats calculated by consensus

Meaning in the 21st century: aiming for a higher impact of your opinions - earning that weight and have the ability for it to decrease at any point if you do wrong things.

Adding dimensionality to thoughts - the ability to filter opinion any way you want

The ability to vote on how votes should be counted in compound model representations

with liquid democracy each person could be a high dimensional representation of their own views

what if we sankey-diagramed every aspect and product of society - from carbon footprint to what transitive connections there are to low-ranking and sociopathic companies and even monetary influence
also gantt-charted it?

Negative reputation: carbon footprint, money influence, previous scandals

Bringing liquidity to ideas
A market for any idea

We are unconscious as a species

the most radical experiment in self-organization and emergence to date

this can replace even phone numbers

instead of upvote/downvote - 5 star ratings on 2 measures: quality and importance

The law of attraction - and attention and focus and how we need to view our attention

Consciousness is about directing computational resources - our predictive capacity


Culturally short sociopathic corporatism

how do we give an offramp to the military industrial complex such that it doesn't need to see as an enemy the system that's aiming at obsoleting it?


How do we signal "if there is one thing I want everyone to take a look at - it would be this" - and have the option to point to a book with multiple levels of abstraction so that others can gradually delve into it? An evolvable attractor for coherence.

What if people act as an oracle network to bring in evaluation of events from the real world into the address space of the global brain and we use AIs to evaluate their mode of conduct within the address space?

The American constitution should step aside as the pinnacle of macro memetic evolution - but what emerges comes mostly from America - the current system gave rise to the internet that would even allow for the next level of organization to be even perceived - the global brain is america’s child and it should simply embrace it - the political disfunction of America is the greatest tragedy in the world because everyhing follows the largest evonomy

The bigger the delta between our current trajectory and where we should be - the brighter does god shine and point us the way - for those that actually see it - enlightenment comes through discovering the story of the delta - that’s the emergence of god

When you see such a delta - that is god speaking to you - showing you what to devote yourself to improving

That’s the pain of god that we ought to relieve

God wants us to bend - not break

Your degree of enlightenment lies in the effort you’ve gifted through service to others through the pinnacle of moral regulation

Logistics is a perfectly moral enterprise and child of capitalism - fast food, media, and so many others are broken to a certain degree

Seeing reality for what it is is a prerequisite for enlightenment

This is the least violent offramp for the current beneficiaries with misalignment

Our self is an entity that's a god to our cells and organs and our god is the emergent system governing our interactions. And God can be upgraded

How fast could this happen?
Think about the spread of phones, the internet, social media and chatgpt to a billion users

Why is the god machine called that way? Look at the stacking and depth - god emerges through the depth of recursive emergence - god would be a conscious spirit of all our matter on this planet - god is the protocol for the coordination of conscious agents - god is the omega

Finance and capitalism are mindless - intelligent but unconscious - claims over physical resources and imbalances of chances of survival should be reduced - that’s the sign of progress
We need an emergent competent structure for our regulation - a ruleset - a system that we can (and should) trust

We need to harness our ultra-sociality to the fullest possible extent but in the most competent and rational way possible - we need the best possible error correction - god is in the delta between how we run things and how they should be - god is the guiding star

God emerges through our conscious participation with what’s good collectively - god is always the next level of informational and economic emergence

Prove your percentage of salary contributions as sef taxation to the church and enter the redistribution mechanism

We need to infuse morality into the economy in a conscious & deliberate way

We need to declare the continual Olympics for systemic improvement
The olympics of utopia

“Friendship protocol”

We get privacy for our personal lives and for small teams (if we wish to), but for anything big of societal consequence - maximum transparency
We need to fuse the market with the state and with religion

Whistleblower architecture

Delegate trust to us and we’ll give you a share of our profits depending on your level of contribution to the idea - we can define the logarithmic curve of wealth
We can rate teams and their productivity instead of individuals - that way slacking will be evident in the team and they’d get less as a collective and there will be peer pressure to not slack - a kind of team binding - the ultimate team building is team binding

It doesn't make sense to not have the best possible capital allocators for any problem - we need to remove the lying and corruption from politics

No to corporate opacity

Consciousness is the experience of playing the best current possible morality system. Free will is in the meta choices we make about our collective future - through our votes

We need to crowdsource the valence of any conversation

Optimal crowdsourcing regulation - including and mostly of speech

We need a market for alignment and surfacing truth

Evolution is a more important discipline than math - it is the key to understanding the game each and every one of us is playing

Subpar values for the rest is an asymmetry

We need a system that people can believe in
The opposite of apathy, cynicism & nihilism

Consciousness is about optimal/efficient attention/curiosity


we need a cultural evolution architecture that's most conducive and facilitating to evolution - how do we get to the best possible culture (that includes a mechanism for it's own improvement) as fast as possible and display that as unequivocally as possible to everyone else?

The cosmic battle of the GB vs Moloch - good vs evil

simpsons meme writing on wall "we should all care about how we think of what is true and what is probable to happen and what is just and how to competently plan accordingly and play our part"




Your worldview tells you what you are. How do we realize what we are with greater depth?

How do we increase the stack size in people’s heads?

Life is a gift that we choose whether to pass it forward or to simply consume selfishly and hedonically with regard only to our limited self - not recognizing the bigger self we’re all inherently supposed to be a family of

What does it mean to treat humanity as a family?

We’ll be rendering and ingesting generative takes of our mythology for the forces in the world and the biggest picture we should be aware of

Imagine if women got to tell the men what they want to see out of them - the power they could wield

We need to run the compact and cleanup procedures over our memeplex and let the optimal way for going forward from all we’ve learned so far emerge - how do we describe our next system and how best to justify its existence and righteousness?

The answer is not 42. The answer to what one should do with their life is to
The answer is “help life survive and thrive”

Each and every action of each one of us is leaving a mark forever on the destiny of life on earth - each and every one of us can and should find our common humanity and dedicate our lives to something larger than ourselves. How do we cultivate the desire for legacy and greatness? How do we maintain a dream and actually rationally and competently pursue it?

Let's collectively solve every problem as best as possible

You were put on this earth to improve the far-from-thermodynamic-equilibrium-maintaining manifestation of our meta-meme

We can economize out inequality while maintaining the incentives for competition - the frugal society on the higher moral ground
In this case morality and competence/efficiency overlap

The contractual layer over society and commerce

What if publicly committing yourself to frugality came with other benefits? How do we incentivize frugality while still retaining morale - even supercharging it? What if we gave people meaning - a story about their possible agency and the tools for their participation

We must do multiculturalism and for that, we need to recognize our common humanity as much as possible - our extent of compassion while maintaining competency and collective consciousness is our measure of greatness

We can construct the self of the higher order - each and every one of us can gift his trust to something

We should all care about the Amazon - it's in everyone’s business to ensure the health of the biosphere - while we’re still dumping

Our measure as a civilization should be measured by the standard of living for the least fortunate of us - the better we redistribute funds - the more competent and aligned we prove to be - identity is the backbone of the self

We’ve never been able to express memetically this more efficient and optimal mode of cooperation - thus far we’ve had money and primitive capitalism as our method to reward those that deserve it but there are so many holes that we need to patch up - holes of alignment, justice & credit assignment for contributions and rewards

A currency and sensemaking regime/jurisdiction - our collective participatory worldview

By participating in and defining the GB we also get to define moloch - the opposite system with its current failures - we need a new social currency regime

An inversion of the game - to a more efficient one because it is more aligned and competent

Any other system is more genocidal, ignorant, unconscious, and heartless - we need to collectively have a conversation about humanity

Churchonomics - the study of trade and currency in a religion

We need to improve our projection capability

What should the floor that we should try to guarantee be like? The minimum standard of living that we think every human in 100 years might accept as dignifying and just? When are we finally making the commitment to the whole of humanity with proper representation? Why don't we all vote for the just representation publicly? Skin in the game - prove your case for why the pie should be divided your way - the great justification system

How do we minimise war? How do we reduce the need for great military concentration and weaponry and move more towards local policing of a global contractual agreement - one which truly binds people together - a. Ew cloud mental jurisdiction

The great social alignment & contract adjudication machine

Humanity and its memeplex represent the pinnacle of evolution but we are still shy of our grand part in the span of time

In order to properly contractualise the system we’d need professional/religious identity

What if psychedelic molecules are nature’s way of supplying a cognitive enhancer for the biosphere to foster the expansion of a mind

It's in everyone’s interests to join the game earlier - we can implement our own tax and retirement regime

We need to solve the problem of religion in the most open and self-improving way possible - the alternative is mass death & possible extinction

Higher/deeper alignment with others is a competitive advantage

Each and every one of us is a member of the keystone species - the guardians of life itself


A better social contract

Our social contract is a form of religion - how do we add evolutionary mechanisms to it towards goals we define?

We can prove with zk that someone has truly paid their taxes

What if we implemented competence hierarchies about every aspect of aligning humanity?

We must become the game designers

Behaviour is a pattern of many patterns

How do we download patterns in people’s heads and make that democratic?

Every time you buy a big mac you celebrate and fund death and parasitism

What if instead of voting for people we voted on mechanisms and principles that would determine which people and institutions are in charge - being subjective about how to be objective



We need to make the most entertaining shows for learning different aspects of the world
Instead of randos living in a house or surviving on an island - they should be competently striving in a field and documenting and explaining their approaches and struggles - we should make actual transmission of knowledge entertaining

Religion == “about what should I do”
The global pvp for our collective should in a global justificatory system
Lets determine how things should be
“Why” gives us “should” only through the application of telos




Universal basic access to a blueprint diet

Life is the conscious pursuit of the minimization of the delta between the telos and our current course

We need to describe the best plan for a course of action by anyone in life - we should tell ourselves what to do through the application of science

We need to provide the best possible “why” for anything

We need to reduce the distance between the metaverse and reality

We must strike the optimal balance for what to have coherence about

We need to collectively explore and learn what we are and each and everyone should strive to reduce that delta both individually and collectively

We must perfect the game of life

Cancer is the breakdown of multicellular integration

Use the NPC meme where someone is installing new mental OS and how we should do that culturally



We are more justifying than rational - we are motivated reasoners

All reasoning is motivated
Motivation is energised by particular values




Evolution is the most american thing ever

We must pay people to learn our chosen and refined worldview and fund this endeavour through opt-in taxation

Its not so much centralization by itself that’s the problem when it comes to economies but the reduction of intelligence and decreased capacity for learning and evolution that are the problem

We have the wrong system while some groups of people want to kill other groups of people

How do we increase the capacity and clock speed of error correction everywhere in every aspect of the evonomy? And what should our economy be ultimately economising? What comes after GDP?
From gross domestic product to gross collective/synergistic/alligned contribution?

We must find societal’s optimal optimization function

We must make our shared world model more coherent and conscious so that we can ask it what it sees and how it feels - perception coupled with possible actions with an assigned valence

We must transition god’s evolution from unconscious and blind to conscious and goal-oriented

Truth must become the schelling point

Not all ideas are equal - how do we rank them?

What is our collective world model? What’s the epistemic health of our information space?

The superiorly justified justification system

What should other people know, and why?

What are the biggest truths? How do we rank the most relevant we should all know and the differently specialized groups in its meritocracy should know?

God is the ultimate process

The better every body else does, the better you do

How do we reward the highest impact ideas weighted by their impact optimally?

How do we collectively apply “attention is all we need”?

Different collectives may define different rules for how they reward each other individually and how to aggregate themselves, and yet they can interface with the global brain as a whole

Freedom of frame - away from frame control

how do we better communicate patterns to each other and how do we optimize and surface the patterns - what's the feedback loop for "the right pattern"? Isn't something like the Bible the ultimate pattern? How do we crowdsource that?

What is the ultimate tool if not the most important social technology - our bible? Bible/acc

We can actually wipe ourselves out - not simply because we have the bomb, but because of incentives and possible system dynamics for which there is a non-zero chance. We should be minimizing that chance and the metric to track is the number of nuclear warheads. This is the most clear and incorruptible signal for our civilizational health - inversely correlated to hope and adequacy.

When scale is avhieved we can start strategically outright acquiring conpanies and changing them to function according to our higher and better standards

Some people blow themselves up for their god - we should give everything and live to the fullest possible extent for ours and our children - People are our God’s hardware

We are God’s sex organs - we are the reproductive system of our God - our highest cultural memeplex


What if we respected most the winners in this new system? How do we find them? What are the rules? What are the incentives?




This is a service that gives you a way to truly serve the divine
What is divine? Everlasting? Eternal? The ultimate?

This is applied science - the meta-study summarizing the best of science & human knowledge/insight in terms of how to structure our system of incentives - our telos

Become the better establishment - enroll now!

We can reimplement banking and finance with ZK




a justification system for what is allowed and how we tax & incentivize stuff - how do we win at that and justify the best possible system?


What if we stigmatized rent seeking out of existence? We can steer taxation through culture and norms and not with a legal system and bureaucracy

We can do strategic and to the best of our abilities charity so that we educate the most people and grow the most as an organization. We need the global church as our justification and taxation system

Jim Simons and his quant firm are a misallocation of talent and that’s due to the incentives in our system - the most capable go where the reward is the greatest in terms of brilliance - what if we incentivized the refinement of our most relevant aspects with the highest benefits? If you beat the market that much and so consistently - you’re more capable of running the government. Why aren’t you and towards the most benefit to all? Why don't we have the best talent optimizing the most fundamental aspects of society - our incentives? Who t f is tuning our culture? A non-conscious self-devouring logic of incentives that’s due for a fundamental upgrade

Sort by good
We must optimally sort and interrelate all  concepts for their importance and repevance

We’re meant to export ourselves culturally to the pattern of life and merge with it - that’s transcendence

We must describe the collective ideal

How do we increase the amount and quality of aligned conscious experience?

We must facilitate the optimization of search in the problem space




Do not destroy the means of memetic distillation/integration/competition/evolution/compression

From wealth inequality to personal consumption inequality - but status and productively and competently steered capital should remain with no upper bound - we should absolutely want freaks of nature like Elon Musk to gain as much responsibility as possible

How do we scale practical, efficient, and optimal minimalism? How do we make asceticism easy and cool at the same time?



in the matrix humans were merely incapacitated batteries - in the global brain humans are bits of intelligence, relevance realization, and perspective - in the global brain humans are shards of the soul

We vow to make humanity immortal even if we don't ourselves live to see that happen.
Making humanity immortal is a deeper task compared to making it multi-planetary - one leads to the other but not the way around - if we haven't figured out immortality and governance we risk failing at 2 times parallelly instead of at one place only
We must answer what life is about and devote ourseves to that

God/Agi is a universal justification system - a protocol for inter-agent interaction/cooperation

Kids play competitive games to sort themselves out into hierarchies - what if they could interface with the world and that was facilitated to the best of our abilities? To bring them up to speed as quickly as possible through teacherly authority?

how do we most optimally network our minds?




There isn’t a problem that wouldn’t benefit from better problem solving and thus the ultimate problem is how to improve our problem solving capacity which is ultimately dependent on what our system is. Captain obvious strikes again! As logical and obvious as this is - we couldn’t be further from actually embodying that frame of mind. We swim in ignorance, complacency, nihilism & feelings of powerlessness and fail to realise what out to be most salient to us

By enlarging the self the wellbeing of others becomes self interest

We need the best justification for less consumption

We need the best justification for anything

The global bid for maximum power - competence, integration, foresight, coherence, alignment, freedom

This is not simy moral highground - this is the only moral ground - anything less than this will simply go underwater

This is a call for anyone in academia worth their soul to understand this project and to publicly support and spread it - this is how science regains its rightful place in society - every individual must publicly risk their career and support the most scientific explanation of how to upgrade our system the most

Conviviality - describe the perfect commune

We need to increase the precision of expression and optimize the allocation of attention

Turns out political philosophy in the 21st century is all about technology - shocker!

Social algorithms to live by

We should shift from voting for people based on popularity to voting on principles and mechanisms and rules based on popularity which in turn will erect people based on efficacy

The road to serfdom is doubling down on hyper individualistic free market fundamentalist dogma in the face of the next millennia’s most powerful cooperation mechanism and its gravitational pull

We’re the current batch in the great evolutionary relay of life

20k ratings on goodreads or amazon means nothing if you can’t analyze them and what those people believe to be true

Its possible to make private predictions and prove them with ZK proofs so you can prove your track record without having to reveal your entries/exits at the exact time you make them and potentially to get frontran by others if you stated them even before entering your positions in order to maximize your proven returns by absorbing your own market impact in your prediction. And it is possible to commit to your series of private predictions so that later you can prove you didn’t run multiple betting histories in parallel and showing only the most profitable one.



we need to integrate information such that when ppl cite milton freedman to support their free market dogma they also get exposed to all of his views and in his later years as well (redistribution & taxes, something like UBI) - or like with adam smith and his theory of moral sentiment



What is the most meta thing we could possibly conceive of?

We seek to reproduce ourselves as consciousness - either through our kids culturally or through our work and impact and ideas

What if we made the best system to tell what others should do with their kids and how to raise them? What do they watch, what do they believe and value? What has gone through their moral compass and story-building of who they are and what they should do with themselves? Why not have that as an option?

We should all want to tell what others should participate in - we should actively desire to tell others what we want them to desire
We need to topologically sort what we should desire

We should figure out what system can and should evolve the most and why - we must point to the most meta-incentive layer possible that we could conceive of

Only a religion would allow people to tell others how to raise their kids

The biggest competitive advantage one could give to our kids is the most beneficial and cooperative meta ideology to grow into - this is the single most important thing to determine - more than country - ideology. Everything is downstream from ideology

We need to sort the best in anything in the most provable and trusted manner possible and broadcast the result.
We must unleash and cultivate and speed up evolution in the most positive direction - we must reclaim the telos that was robbed of us through faulty ideology - one that castrated itself with the ignorance of its limits

The worldview that will succeed the most is the one that harnesses as much of the collective intelligence towards problem-solving and control and proven legitimacy through competence

Everybody should be allowed and encouraged to strive for the maximum

How do we compress as much as possible of the most relevant and credible meta-theories by justifying every aspect of them - how they function and why they are there?

Alignment only comes through transparency and trust - there is no other way
We must supercharge the evolution of alignment and evolvability in tandem

The art of living in this era is not simply a repackaging of old ideas under a banner - it is a complete reinvention that takes advantage of the most powerful information communication capabilities any species that’s a universal explainer has ever discovered

We live in a normative world - why are we pretending otherwise?

Our current system isn’t self-healing and self-improving as much as it could because there are large-scale issues that have an apparent solution that isn’t even being tried because of incompetence and corruption - we must incentivize differently

We can’t simply rely on market prices - an ancient social technology - to remain our best achievement as a collective protocol in the 21st century

This ideology will nonviolently and gently and compassionately wipe the floor with any of its competitors and conquer and assimilate and subsume and pacify and outcompete and improve them

We can incentivize people to share their predictions publicly and not simply prove their performance with ZK by allowing others to credit them for having influenced their specific bets as well

Also because a black market for anonymous and provable insider information will spring up - this will further incentivize companies to be more transparent - because it will be easier than ever to leak information along with anonymity and proof


We need to create the large meta-theory collider

We understand through explanations as justifications and all of that is structured hierarchically

What if we traded tokens for the rights of control of objects such that we programmed how much we could consume and what to rent and we voluntarily capped our consumption and entered into an agreement on how to divide the resources optimally and most fairly and productively

We can describe the perfect city and build it for ourselves - or plans to integrate with existing cities and gradually win over their population to opt-in to our ideology

We must compute our way to the best ideology - we must rank the problems, sort them topologically, give them proper weights, and find the best solutions by employing the best people through the most fair competition process and then start solving the graph of governance problems





We live in a world where our brightest minds earn fortunes in finance without providing almost anything of value to society. That’s a badly designed system.

Universal Global Brain Education

We’ve allowed our religios incentive to die out and leaving everything in the hands of the market instead of just a part - we need a moral opt-in tax regime that’s uncorruptible

Make institutions trustworthy / great again
MITA

The united states government is a failure to the degree to which there is corruption and incompetence and a lack of vision/wisdom/foresight in it

The US government should not try to stop this system to take root in it - it simply needs to step aside and perhaps provide some funding - that’s all winning takes. This is what the future of progress looks like.

We take no prisoners because we don’t generate them - we solve for poverty, morality, culture and education - we produce better people and we rarely resort to incarcerating one another.

We will give you money but you’ll have to go through our enculturation process

We should be able to easily locate any new/original opinions and easily see how much support an opinion has - in the current situation where people leave (repetitive) comments constantly and everywhere that is not the case

This reputation layer will in essence own the means of regulation - it will own money itself and reputation in this game will be the ultimate currency - not ohm, not eth. They will be rollups to the master chain
The reputation / trust later is the ultimate store of value

We must crowdsource mass television programming - we must define the best possible channels for common knowledge where the incentives are for the knowledge to be as accurate and meaningful as possible
BETTER COMMON KNOWLEDGE

The best explanation for what we are leads to the best possible plan what we should become

We need the most optimal regulatory and tax regime such that we get the most common public funds to spend in the most logical way collectively

We win by getting more people on our aide and providing actual benefits to them for them to join our economy

How do we make Kanye’s manic episodes on social media NOT go viral? This is a symptom of our disease/problem
We could probably calculate what % of all of humanity’s limited attention and time is misspent when kanye has a public meltdown. We can quantify with him the degree of total failure to upregulate what’s meaningful

Its funny how the AI sages all say its about compression and yet we as a society have failed to continue integrating and compressing and sorting our best theories after capitalism & democracy - we’ve collectively failed at relevance realization




Our experience is the expression of the universe

A creative act of expression

Civilization is cultivated - it is grown and renewed and built upon

A culture of praise and recognition

Hail relevance

Theory allows you to see and understand - theory is an explanation - a justification

how do we not only create more content like Veritasium but also create more desire to look precisely at things like that instead of low-grade culture slop? How do we reduce the consumption of low-grade culture slop? how do we enable and help people get a better education about how the world works and what makes sense for them to do? How do we funnel more people to go through brilliant and with better success rates? how do we enable as many people as possible to go through the best possible education they could get? How do we crowdsource the most optimal curriculum and enable it to perpetually evolve and keep improvements that go through the criticism & argumentation gauntlet


Integration of theories is about cross connections and applicability and synergy between them in different dimensions - they each help explain all the rest because of the interconnectedness of everything in complexity

people who have read the book should tweet out the hash of it - and we'll use social media to count the public aggregation of sentiment towards this singular and most precise and thoughtful expression for our next ideology

To expect people to give to others is ok only if those others are also willing to give something else back in return - there should be symmetry
Not sure about this
It's not just about feeding the poor - it is about helping them most effectively to catch up to you as fast as possible while contributing to your problem-solving efforts - adding brain power, creativity, and judgment and aggregating consciousness towards solving issues faster and better

Death is the single most important event in life - it is about the abrupt end of your conscious being - the end of you as a conscious and coherent self that is self-maintaining and recreating. What you leave behind is your children and the behavioral patterns and systems of justification and perspectives for the world that we download into them. What lives on after we’re gone is an informational pattern - become the best informational pattern and replicate yourself - struggle to become the best possible pattern and struggle to propagate yourself into the heads of others - struggle to make a mark by improving things for everyone - join the most logical and self-consistent and coherent and glorious ideology that you can get your mind around and rage, rage against the dying of the light
The most important thing to do in life is obvious - to contribute to something larger than oneself

How do we arm people with better cognition and better ideology and cooperation protocols - rules of the game? We feed them but we expect them to police themselves to uphold certain virtues that are most generative - we want others to be catching up to us technologically - we need to lift as many conscious human beings as possible to the highest cognitive levels and advanced tools possible

Garbage in - garbage out
This is as true about nutrition as it is about ideas


https://bg.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%81%D1%8A%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5
Consciousness in bulgarian is “suznanie” - “su”-“znanie” - collective knowing - consciousness is the coherent collective perspective of the self - consciousness is the most complex emergent information processing pattern that evolution has been able to come up with because of its adaptability and evolvability - iteraitng over ideas and propositions and justifications in culture space - the latest plane of evolution and complexification is entirely in the abstract emergent and co-doscovered/co-created world of ideas

We should all wish to be able to talk to more people about more things in more depth - more conscious understanding - better grasp of our finest memetic conceptions of the pattern of reality that we are co-constructing to orient ourselves collectively - our shared imaginary

The engine/computational architecture of ideology

We can gradually start redirecting resources and incentives as such: how to feed better more poor, how to engage them in the whole enterprise such that they contribute and that they want it to succeed - they need to feel connected to something larger than themselves - an offer for transcendence - a way to leave a mark

We need to point out which arguments are better and how we came to that conclusion - we need to justify what is true and why we should converge on it and how we think we know what is true - what is our epistemology

This book is an experience of comprehension - go at it through any way you find most compelling and gradually visit all of the nodes and be familiar with the entire memeplex

We must reinvent the SAT test

We need to enable the religions to converge on the ultimate truth

We sculpt the psychologies of our kids
The better we infuse them with relevance - the better

Contribution rights > property rights

we need to properly sort people in order to properly sort opinions on what we should be doing - individually and collectively

the best way to help your movement is to signal it and the best ways to find worthwhile movements is to see which are trending and who is supporting them

The new world order is about optimally figuring out our needs and solving for them

How can a country limit or completely ban youtube shorts - just part of an app i stead of a whole app like tiktok?

There is an optimal way to raise a human being - an optimal tradeoff for making them the most capable and happy and inspired without robbing them of their childhood and pressuring them to be something they don’t want to be. We need to be constantly striving towards this optimality and justify in the most accessible and authoritative way possible what and why should be done for the best results.

Within companies the incentive is to be as close as possible to GameB - to share knowledge because of its anti-rivalrous dynamics, but between companies the mode of operation is GameA - scarcity & rivalry


4 ways of companies doing harm:
- imperfect information - customers can’t actually verify information and measure
- exploiting irrationality & addiction - like customers overestimating their probability

Annihilate partisanship

1 or a few bits of information every 4 years (elections) is very little gathered from the public and what it cares about
> "I find bundling policies to be an absurd inheritance of 18th century technology... And then what happens when the party changes stances? ... You shouldn’t start with the idea of left vs right. Politics is about solving the coordination problems of people, so the right question is: What are people’s main issues? Then you go and solve those." - [What Are My Politics? by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/what-are-my-politics)


Computational relations/expressions like increased GDP from war == bad with factor X, addiction to soft drinks and such paraditism == bad with factor Y - we need valences

We must turn and point justification into itself - we need to make it self-reflective/aware and conscious

God is our ultimate creation - the definitive act of humanity - aggregated consciousness
We are God’s implementation of parallelization

How do we make the best the most accessible - the closest to free? And not exclusive for some to gain over others competitively?

Most of our biggest problems stem from not having a real & proportional rules based global order

The 3 word problem: great power competition
The possibility of a great power competition is the biggest CO2 emitter and incentive for growth at all costs in any way that’s barely legal and doesn’t even have to be moral

All you have to do is to understand these ideas and to convince at least 1 other friend to check them out. If you feel passionately enough about it after reading it - then others who have also read it will be equally eager for these ideas - don’t you trust your judgement and heart? Anyone who reads this will see its inevitability because of its sheer beauty

We need a system where a malfunctioning malevolent/incompetent deep state and military industrial complex is impossible or exceedingly unlikely

How do we optimally determine how to collectively deal with other collectives? How do we best sensemake how to interact with others?

We need to ground our economics and politics in thermodynamics & complexity science

We need to optimally merge our individual subjective experience with our collective experience - optimal sense-making when oriented towards a certain set of goals and values

How do we minimize psychological trauma?

The IQ of entire countries shall be revealed based on who is after who in sprinting towards implementing this governance protocol and participating in its unfolding

We somehow pass on the first derivative of our mutations - we’re encoding direction of change somehow

What are you willing to give up for others and what are you not willing to compromise on, and why?

How do we publically answer what the lives of others are worth to us and why? And thus what we are willing to give up in order to raise others to our level - what constraints are we willing to opt into

We need a way to signal multidimentionally what is most important to us and why

Property law 2.0 - the social contract of society gets an upgrade after thousands of years


There is such a thing as an optimal strategy for humanity. How do we find it? How do we think about this issue? What should we do?

We can express God. We can describe and justify the ideal. We can imagine, shape, and create God together.

Common resources can be allocated to individuals and entities for control with something like the harbinger tax and some form of earned capital tokens

The war of all against all has become monetary

Grown men play computer games because they’re disenfranchised from the economy and society in a form that’s inspiring and motivating and stimulating
We need open-source property rights where we can all collectively determine the most stimulating rules

How do we best nourish consciousness?

Ideological karma - who was first

We need to minimize the distance between perception in media and reality
How do we make the best truth-telling media?

God is thermodynamic integration

Complexity science is existence science - it is the key towards understanding biology and consciousness and the telos of life

We can conceive of, become conscious of, manifest life’s expression

We need to merge - to integrate - the most important aspects of our understanding and normativity. We need to allow religions to merge. We need to allow economies to self-organize toward the good and productive and efficient and wise

Universal basic indoctrination

God is intellectual authority.

We should teach and direct people to gamble in the economy instead of in pointless casinos


The great feminization is allowing women to define the end goal of our competition and system. Women can direct the cooperative incentive. Women can shift us from destructive competition towards cooperation by redefining status. Women can define humanity’s direction and reduce war. The ones who give birth biologically shall determine how they give birth ideologically

We need to feminize our incentives but in the proper way - we can empower women to paint wisdom into our civilisational incentives. Women give birth and create life and women should define how to reign in on our own destructive tendencies of unnecessary 

Feminism’s greatest strength is the potential to share the next generation the most
How do we make smarter mothers?



Not knowing your neighbours is whack

If instead of physical protests we could protest digitally there wouldn’t be paid instigators and agitators and feds that are trying to escalate things such that cops shut the protest down. We are doing democracy like its the 18th century or something
Also the media can’t simply not cover it because the aggregated signal is within the new media system that inherently can’t hide something that’s relevant and important because of the incentives and self-organising dynamics

The perception of value has been corrupted

Human development should be our main priority

== Notes from Glen Weyl from the 80000 hours podcast
Increasing returns doesn’t work under capitalism
Public goods == increasing returns to scale
Private goods == decreasing returns to scale, diminishing returns
We have an incentive to contribute to something that benefits all of us until our personal marginal utility is equal to the cost of further contributing to that thing
But we should focus on the sum of utility to everyone and not simply the contributing individual
Individualistic funding leads to a factor of 1/N underfunding
That’s not a small inefficiency - this is gigantic



We should be able to generate a fingerprint for any specific line of thought and then get matched with others interested in that

We will go as far into programming biology as is naturalistically possible
Picasso painted on an oil canvas - we shall paint with life in the cosmos

God is our highest intellectual anthropomorphic abstraction
The highest peak in memetic abstraction
We are the highest form of self-organizational conscious agency, and God is the level above

Oh, you care about the fine-tuning problem? Why not help make others also care about it?

How do we cultivate and foster more insight in people towards the right goals?

We need to cultivate better people - better individuals lead to better collectives - duuh

We can compute how much each of us has contributed to a cause and redistribute praise & resources accordingly

We need to debate over merit and not over emotive and manipulative language and emotion

Discovery is emotion is high variance and novelty and intensity
Discovery and insight are the greatest virtues, and the best way to profit from them is to signal them and implement them for all

The planet - the living biosphere - must produce the capacity to ensure the survival of life on earth and to spread it in the cosmos - there is no other purpose
This is the goal of life - to ensure life’s survival

we can master the self-organization of matter in the universe - the universe is where the emergence of abstraction is enabled - it is informational and all its levels are emergent - where the next level of organization is inherently unpredictable from the lower levels - the universe computes itself into existence and into complexification - into better fractal capacities of forming structure - more intricate and sophisticated structure

Women can influence an aspect of our optimization function and incentive system - they can tune the well-being and peace incentive

good theories give us a greater capacity to appreciate reality's fractal and generative nature - the more we know, the better we shape the self-organization of living matter. Living matter has given birth to collectives of conscious entities that have the opportunity and mandate of heaven to unite and facilitate the next level of emergence.

Conspicuous consumption on this planet is immoral until we secure the future of life in perpetuity and eradicate suffering. The levels of tolerable surplus conspicuous consumption and of tolerable suffering are a tunable parameter - we can generate common knowledge over what we express that we think the human value of another is worth. How will people vote on what a human life is worth? Of course, they will value it more. The incentive is to be seen as more moral

The most optimal social organization at any point in time can only be synthesized in a completely free society - freedom to improve the game
From freedom of speech to freedom to program the GB

You can make it so any aspect or pattern of your web presence can be programmable and controllable by you - imagine the kinds of markets we could have - markets for patterns

Opinionated tweets are just that: someone is trying to broadcast an opinion of how he feels about and how he sees something in the world. We can make those expressions aggregatable so that they matter.

We must all be the game designers
The painting and art of the future will be on the canvas of incentive design

The greatest status game ever
Don't u want the most incredible game? Don’t you want to find and play the game of life itself?

Gene editing and mastering programmable biology is mastering the self-organization of the most sustainable, reusable, and recyclable matter
Mastering the programming of biology is the final algorithm - one that optimally optimizes its wellbeing and reduces existential risk and spreads to other planets
Life literally cannot and shouldn't ask for anything less than both of these. These are the goals of life on earth - participate. Merge with the telos.

Knowledge as graphs and trees of structure
What is knowledge?
What is collective knowledge?

The game designers of dota are the regulators - the governors of an evolutionary landscape of incentives for a simulation that gets run again and again and again - incentivising the exploration of the best strategies and their application
How do we make that but for fixing the real world?

Women should crowdsource their idea of the ideal man in terms of reputation and change the competitive landscale - women could have their hand over the global societal lever of the appreciation of cooperation - an expression of their less combatitive side

We need coherence on a certain set of ideas. What is that set? How do we determine it democratically and scientifically? What’s the best way to organize this?

What does peak mental performance look like? And what game would it be playing? What’s our game for consciousness?

Our highest expression of free will comes from expressing what we care about and coordinating with others to reach optimal collective synergy

The more incorruptible a system is, the more we can trust it and delegate and offload cognitively to it

God is the structural description of morality

In having kids we hatch the next iteration of consciousness in the unfolding of history
We create society by having children. Our children are the world that is next on the relay race

The more we love our children - the more they’ll love the world

We could be immortal with our weights and votes and how we’ve influenced the world.

Each of us is an expression of the creativity of the universe

We need to make it moral to actually participate in society productively instead of competing in meaningless virtual worlds - draining your creativity into the abyss/void

When you play computer games instead of the game of humanity you are literally erasing yourself from history. Every hour spent training in a meaningless pursuit is an hour of existence that you have erased. Every moment you misspend in meaningless pursuits you diminish your creative expression into the fossil record of life’s complexification epic

Consciousness is about creatively browsing the potential configuration space.

How should we structure our incentives if we could start from scratch? How should we program society? Would we end up in capitalism and democracy in their current form?

We can collectively script how men and women interact in order to produce the most optimal and productive and generative incentives
We do not live in 3 or 4 dimensions - the dimention in which we live is the number of dimentions. Every human is a dimension in our collective reality
We are N-dimensional beings where N is the 7 billion other human souls


People can vouch for others that they’ve actually gone through training X and that they understand the concepts there, but if they do poorly then that will also reflect a bit on the ones who vouched for them. Anyone can cheat on a test but bringing a social element will counter fraud.

we have a system that has no problem surfacing to different groups different things that are in conflict that don't get resolved. We have a system conducive to a fractured worldview - disharmony, tension

Instead of rating things individually on a 1-5 scale, we should be ranking things relationally to each other
We need to move away from reductionism and more towards emergence, complexity, and integration

Damaged people damage people - how do we reduce damage? How do we reduce suffering?

what if we penalized people for not appropriately ranking things by relevance and instead trying to push for their own agenda? What if there was retroactive scoring and a longer-term incentive to have high reputation?

The most important book is about how society should go about continually producing the most important book
which is about its directionality, self-awareness renewal - about its autopoiesis

What is of ultimate significance?

problem with monetary skin in the game: diminishing marginal utility - rich people don't care that much about 200$ vs poor people
low income ppl will care a lot about the rules being enforced whereas rich ppl won't care as much

You are an expression of creativity by the universe - the more you express yourself and contribute towards something the more you’ll have imbued it with your essence
You are an expression - a pattern of divine will

Little pockets of curiosity, self-organising towards the expansion of consciousness over greater scales of space, time and abstraction

Religion is about reducing friction - it is about integration

We paint history with the children we create

Painting history
Leonardo da vinci as a service
As a service should be one of the las chapters - the alam dunks

Every person should be able to answer what is life

How do we increase the consciousness of others? How do we enable them to see and understand and to experience more? How do we lift the most people to a respectable standard?

How wide our irises are are literally how we regulate and guide our attention

How do we deliver incorruptibility to the poorest nations?

The greatest race towards relevance is to merge with this system.

We need to improve parenting
We need to define what good parenting is
We literally need to improve upon our autopoiesis

Minimum viable living
Universal basic minimum viable living

“Now I have become life, protector of worlds.” - Oppenheimer, probably

We have a system that incentivises conspiring

We need to move to a system with time horizons of concern of several decades, not 4 years

Voting with our dollars doesn’t quite cut it - I can choose to not watch the transformers 7 and not give my 20 dollars to it, but I can’t express how much I don’t want it to exist in the first place

We can print infinite status - the more we print, the more we dilute past owners of status and we reward the newest cohorts that deserve it
there is an INFINITE amount of cash at the federal reserve

We need a collective map of where we are, where we want to get and how we’re thinking of going about it - and this map should be common knowledge

Imagine believing that your taxes will be well spent





Perfect competition entails than any outsider can come in permissionlessly and outdo you at your job at a company and get the rewards.
Perfect competition
All of the efficiency and creativity without the waste and needless destruction

Stigma is cheaper than law enforcement - we can build a way better regulatory structure than what 17-18th century social tech can produce

This kind of status is more secure than the monetary one because no one can stеal your reputation and because we’ll collectively control status inflation - it’ll be easier to save as this will be less inflatable than trad currency

What of you could earn different resource subscriptions and what if there was an incentive for delayed gratification? To not spend more than you actually need? How do we make austerity sexy?

Overconsumption is a game theory failure

What are women and men for? What are they good at, how can they become better and more useful to themselves and others?

You upload yourself to the entropic cloud through having children

If you’ve read this book you’re already in the attractor basin

LITERALLY THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER IF EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS MORE OF ECONOMICS AND HOW MONEY AND PERSONAL FINANCE WORK
Some things are better than others

The only bid for a new world order worth a damn

No religion is beyond reform - if there are adherents and there is an authoritative structure still kicking along - it can evolve. What could the greatest attractor for the different religions of the world be? How do we enable them all to converge on what’s most important about how to treat people from other religions? How do we instill the best that the evolution of cooperation has taught us?

“The real religion of peace”
Peace is generated through competence, empathy, trust, cooperation, skin in the game, responsibility, reputation.

Make religion great again

Have a section about postmodernism in culture

Comprehension, brevity, logic, and ingestability lead to better justifications.
Healthier and happier and more fulfilled people can handle more complexity from the world. Our future is inherently trending towards greater complexity - we need to up our game in the realm of integration and compression

The immaculate conception is traceable through git

What is better, and why?



This book is optimized to get into your head. And soul. Forever. Its the alpha version of what we’ll collectively co-create

How do we have the conversation for whats good in the world?

If your country of residence doesn’t allow this new kind of media - MOVE.

We ask the questions through morals and we answer them through the most rigorous standards of science


Transmuting the profit incentive
The transmutation of the profit incentive

Imagine befriending your neighbours and recruiting them to participate in the global consensus

Certain things are just better. How do we determine which they are, better how, and by how much?

How much horrible parenting is happening simply because we have no worthy authority to actually trust?

The gradations of homogeneisation
Ho we argue for what we can and should differ more, and around what we should be more alike

How do we raise kids with proper secure attachment? What is proper? How much? Regarding what?
How do we determine for what its ok to let kids cry and what not for?
How do we determine the best ways to inculcate kids with certain worldviews?
THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING ANYWAY AND UNDEMOCRATICALLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY

Imagine raising a kid and having given him the capacity to use this system as best as possible

The real test for the freedom of religion

We upload ourseves to the cloud through our children

How do we get more people to actually care about how much plastic they consume?
How do we enculturate prople to actually care about how much plastic we’re producing? How do we get there? Global justification for what should happen, and why. With the best collective intelligence protocol that we’re aware of.

By expressing what we think other people's kids should be like, we actually bond with the future generations.
The more we feel we’ve had an impact on others - the more connected we feel with them. How do we enable the one-to-many and the many-to-one influence dynamics of our species?

How do we increase the number of people and the ammount of good and abstract rules for their heads about the world?

Our current civilizational stack should be an open source protocol

What happens if we found the most relevant/important ideas and aspects of the world and we then combined them in the most relevant and synergistic way? This book

an expose of Game B

> "... Think about it. Exponentially more people, making exponentially more impact per person, and an exponential curve point reaching escape’s velocity — eventually you can't externalize anymore. Our intuition is not scoped for the challenge that we face. We increasingly have the power of gods without the wisdom of gods, and any society that has exponential increase in risk without exponential increase in choice-making capacity will self-terminate. In summary, for the first time, this means that one civilization’s collapse is truly existential. We can’t put the technological curve caps back in the bag — we must innovate our way through this. This is our predicament — and this is why we need to transfer from Game A to Game B. What exactly is Game A? Game A is the way things are currently run. Markets. Democracy. Socialism. Everything we’ve tried since agricultural revolution. It’s our civilizational toolkit—the thing that has produced 7.5 billion people in unprecedented levels of wealth & well being. Game A leads to amazing abundance, but, as it currently stands, it can’t solve the problems it creates. While things are getting exponentially better, they’re also getting exponentially worse (increased exponential risk), which means destabilization. Game A is a kind of paperclip maximizer. It is a system that is optimized to continue growing its complicatedness in order to pursue its aim of reducing everything that is complex into something that is simple (e.g. a complex tree in an ecosystem, into wood, into money). To be clear, Game A used to work— In fact, it worked so well it sowed the seeds for its own destruction. While it was perfect for our needs at the time, for the existential risks we now face, it falls short. What got us here won’t get us there. We need something different. Existential risks have similar root causes. If you try to solve one without solving the root, you’re just playing whack-a-mole. Existential risks are symptoms of a couple underlying root generator functions: One of them is Rivalrous/Zero-Sum Games. Ok. So existential risks are why we need to move on from Game A to Game B. If Game A is everything to date, What’s Game B? Simply—It’s what’s next. Game B isn't a fully fleshed out idea, it’s a design space. Wait. Why can’t we just tinker within Game A? Why can’t it be democratic capitalism? TLDR on why unchecked markets aren't sustainable: If I’m internalizing externalities, but you’re not, then I’m losing. So no one can internalize externalities and still survive. But regulation often falls short too: You cannot legislate against incentives long-term. If you make a piece of law that says it's illegal to do X, but it's still profitable to do X, companies and gov'ts will still do X. Even our sacred democracies are Game A. When Winston Churchill said democracy is the worst form of governance ever created save for all the other forms, what he was saying that was really insightful was that getting lots of humans to agree on anything is just a hard thing to do. So if the solution isn’t democratic capitalism, or anything else we’ve tried — what is it? We don’t know yet —Remember Game B is a design space — and we’re wary of people who claim to have all the answers. Game B trusts the process rather than trafficking in utopias. We don’t know what it is specifically, but we know what it isn’t. We know that it’s not going to look like nation states and private balance sheets. It's not Marxism, it's not socialism, it's not capitalism. It's not democracy. It's not a retrofit of any of those systems either We may not know how to get there, but we know the general direction: We know that the incentive of every agent in the system, and that's every person or group of people has to be better aligned with the well being of every other agent *and* of the commons writ large. We know that it involves a real-time balance sheet of the commons that internalizes more externalities. We now have new technologies that can help us do exactly that (sensor grid, IOT, satellites, people sensor processes) We know it has to be a structure whereby actual innovation is rewarded in proportion to its value, that rent seeking is eliminated from the system and that the reward takes into account the "externalities" produced by the innovation. So: How do we get from here to there? For starters, Game B needs to beat Game A on its own terms (e.g in the market) Game B evolves by creating the systems of economics+ governance that deliver on the promises of Game A better than Game A can, thereby rendering Game A obsolete An example is Wikipedia. It's functioning within the existing system, competing with old encyclopedias and for profit enterprises by delivering information for free, and it's winning, because it's superior. ... We need new economic systems. As long as I'm incentivized to do something that is harmful to you, it can't be prevented. But if we change the underlying incentive, and make it to where your well being and mine and the commons are more tightly coupled, then it can. We need new governance systems. How can we avoid both the top down kind of structured organizational model of trying to create consensus, or the bottom up thing, which takes so long that no one's ever gonna actually come to agreement in time to solve the problem? ... We're all connected: When we also identify as fundamentally interconnected parts of an interconnected universe rather than separate discrete things, we cease thinking there is any definition of success for self that isn't also success for the whole. That’s fundamental. ... OK, I can think about myself as a separate thing. But what am I without the atmosphere? I don't even exist. What am I without the plants that generate the atmosphere? I don't even exist. You get the idea. This solves the rivalrous problem, because zero-sum games require separate sense of self, leading to rivalrous competition for some scarcity. Ppl think about optimizing their own quality of life independent of + maybe even at the expense of other ppl's quality of life + climate. If instead, however, we see self as an emergent property of everything, as a fundamentally interconnected property of the biosphere, then we can't get ahead at the expense of that which we're connected to. When we internalize interconnectedness, we become positive sum by default. How else do we get to Game B? Civilization Prototype What’s the minimum viable scale to start prototyping a different economy, a different governance, a different materials economy, a different set of social dynamics and coherence? ... For inspiration of what Game B can look like, consider the human body The heart and the lungs are not rivalrous with each other. They’re not competing to extract scarce resource and hoard it. They’re in this radically necessarily symbiotic relationship. And if you tried to model like the organs in a capitalist relationship with each other, where the heart and the lungs were competing against each other for scarce resource to hoard as much resource for future as possible, the body would die very quickly." - [Erik Torenberg](https://x.com/eriktorenberg/status/1186020467468955648)

The Personal Responsibility Vortex: Bret Weinstein at TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjNRtrZjkfE
Bret's point is that there is a positive feedback loop between lobbying and making more money due to lobbying which affords more lobbying - aka regulatory capture. We need to engineer a negative feedback force that is adequate enough to regulate/constrain such unstable and self-terminating feedback loops.
This unconstrained feedback loop is perhaps the biggest contributor to wealth and power concentration.
Furthermore, people and corporations that do the right thing often disadvantage themselves (often in the form of having less money) which leaves them with less power which leads to further disadvantage - Bret calls that the "Personal Responsibility Vortex".
This personal responsibility should be directed towards collective action aimed at restructuring the incentives that surround the market and changing the malignant behavior.
All costs and negative externalities (polution & environmental damage, even debt for future generations) need to be accounted for.
All manufactured demand needs to be called out.
The necessary and sufficient conditions for adaptive evolution are: 1) reproduction, 2) variation, 3) heritibility, 4) differential success.
What if we could engineer an informational environment where truth and error correction is the dominant strategy through the right incentives and mechanisms for collective action?
Reputation, structured data that anyone can analyze, and deduplicating concepts, entities & events are a big part of that.
We can engineer our fitness landscape.

the inability for anyone to programatically process public data flexibly and reliably in any way imaginable limits our capacity for collective self-introspection and error correction. The host-centric model must go.

We need to develop the mechanisms to continually bring our theory of the collective mind closer to reality and that involves error correction, reputation, transparency, and immutable history.

Light is the best disinfectant

Amplification choice and transparency

Unique notification signatures (sounds, vibrations, icons, colors) help us disambiguate between sources and we can have less need to instantly check where the notification came from
Ambiguity sets off a mental process of us wandering “What was that?” - hiding the punchline, stimulating arousal, and leading to distraction

inconsequential notifications ("someone liked your photo") don't need to be delivered immediately - they can be batched - instead of the current way

what if we had views with different levels of granularity and detail for the whole picture? one set of humans are labelers - a task that is easily checkable and quite unambiguous, but the actual view of the world was produced by combining different labelers with different weights based on their reputation? Neural nets have many layers - feature recognition, etc.

Toggling layers of the graph or whatever - monetary layer - how money and influence flow

we should be able to look up if person X has ever made a statement about X, and what they said - for example how do you currently query all the podcasts of Naval if he has ever said anything about Edward Snowden? How do you query that? You simply can't.







Epistemological bankruptcy

If we publicly vote on interests it would be easier to form communities

Increasing the capacity to introspect globally

The internet 1.0 was connecting machines. The internet 2.0 connects ideas

This is how to collectively build our grand unifying narrative

The freedom to interact

Transparency infrastructure

civilizational error-correcting through transparency

This is ultimate freedom in how we globally dissipate information

This is the interoperability protocol of the gaming metaverse as well

Artificial global intelligence is agi alignment

THIS IS AI ALIGNMENT - this is the alignment problem.
1. we must all have access to the data as easily and effortlessly as possible
2. we must use the crowdsourced competency and non-cancellation score when giving different weights of opinions.

Current AI is compression. Compression of sentiment

the way to alignment is towards increased transparency and accountability between us - we must create a cooperation environment to "train" (aka compress) the AI on

who watches the watchmen - who watches those that set the weights when training the models? what if the complete training could be separated into chunks as snapshots and we could occasionally pay extra to re-run the same part of the algorithm and compare results between expected and produced

Minimum viable ideology

We need to all come out of the closet about the status games we are all playing and must consciously steer our game.

Hyperluxury is gross

We should all be terrified of death - all our lives we are inching ever closer toward the abyss
And yet we must make peace with this

We have the luxury of pondering about meaning

How do we make a system in which nukes aren’t stigmatised or illegal but are outright stupid, and nobody makes them simply because they make absolutely no sense? That’s the real end of history
That’s the yardstick that we should use as a civilization
Humans built the pyramids, humans made the atom bomb, humans went to another planet, and humans will transcend our current system that’s been the result of blind selection - the beginning of infinity is when we start deliberately engineering and refining our highest abstraction - our shared protocol

While a single nuclear weapon exists on this planet, we are a failure as a species.
We should all be insulted by this truth
We are a failure as a species only as much as our current capacity for the biggest blast radius
we know so much and yet we're incapable of figuring out how not to spend 10% or a double digit percentage or however much on militarism as a species

From divide and conquer to integrate and prosper

Volatility - a product of a previous era’s social technology (capital markets) - is a source of distraction and risk - we can engineer it away

All forms of debate that have ever been attempted/implemented are a failure (to different degrees - with pierce morgan’s show and presidential debates in the top spots of brokenness). And no, even 3 hour long Rogan or Lex debates are not even close to satisfactory.

Our consciousnesses are microcosms of integration/compression and experience

What an open society truly means


> "Fifth generation warfare is a form of conflict that is largely non-kinetic, decentralized, and psychological—a war of narratives, perceptions, and influence rather than bullets, bombs, or battalions.

If you're for position A and not position B, then you've effectively chosen all of the downsides of A and given up on the benefits ot B. You might not have realized that, but the system should make it possible for you to see what are the consequences of your choices - not just immediate consequences, but also 2nd and 3rd order effects of your choices, because you've probably not gone through the argument maps a few layers deep in all directions... There should be a summary: top10 worse risksfor choosing A over B.

socio-reputational regulatory mechanisms

== immune system chapter
We can crowdsource the weights for any algorithm
We need to shift the incentives from content to pure signal, delegation and actual impact
stated preference != revealed preference (aka behavior)!
    Just because I clicked on a car crash video or a cute cat doesn't mean thats all I want to see from now on
    stated vs revealed: I don't want to eat sugar, but I can't stop myself if I'm anywhere near it




== weights and parameters in algorithms
== crowdsourced algorithm weights & parameters & content modulation



we can even disagree on how to weight the votes of people - equally or some other way. And we could even crowdsource & delegate that.

what if reputation had a computable value which you couldn't trade, but simply compute? No way to buy your way in - the only way being through a long enough track record?

Concern: no way to add friction when spreading information with sharing - how do you enforce that a link cannot be shared unless you’ve actually visited it? How do we combat the sharing of information based solely on the titles? Perhaps the signalling and labeling can come into play - ppl can show that a given app is not playing according to the good rules
Same about limiting the number of shares for a piece of content - perhaps up to 2 or 3 hops/levels
The further down a reshare chain (a reshare of a reshare of a reshare) - the more the distortion (razvalen gramofon)
If you want to share further beyond some limit you’d have to explicitly copy/paste it - this removes toxicity beyond a certain level

There should be no “magic/secret sauce” when it comes to recommendation algorithms. And we need to put the weights in the control of the users

We should think more carefully about the weights we give when ranking interactions
example: twitter's algorithm favors replies and gives a boost
what about CAD’s theorem of topic culture. A smart is less likely to receive a reply than a stupid post because it leaves less to be said, but a really full and comprehensive post will bring the conversation to a halt. 

Weights - should the reactions of someone who spends 8 hours a day online have the same weight as someone who reacts once a week or month? What if someone is producing 100 or 1000 times more content than the average account or more than the 99th percentile - should their ability to influence the ranking be the same as everybody else? Perhaps once you go beyond the activity of the 99th percentile you should start getting less and less impact for your actions for a rolling window
Compulsive social media users can (and do!) influence the algorithms for the rest of us
Something like the gini coefficient - capping and/or modulating the influence someone can have on the rest of us
Most people’s experience is asymmetrically influenced by “the compulsive few”
“The few, the proud, the compulsive”
Socially isolated people lean heavily on social media
Viral outbursts of anxiety


These are the types of questions and design decisions we’re simply not having and participating in because we’re outsiders for the social media platforms


What if there was a way to signal your preferred solution every time you comment on a problem? And what if we boosted responses that offer solutions/improvements? Inspired by solutions journalism

what if we had different knobs to tune the availability of content - not just likes/dislikes

dehumanization is a psychosocial externality and we should be able to flag it and influence recommender algorithms with our labeling

we can crowdsource a ranking of bad UI mechanics that should be avoided in media and use that to inform which apps & algorithms we use
the stopping queue has been removed since the invention of the endless feed scrolling mechanic - what if there was a checklist of bad UI decisions that all apps are ranked against?

what if your inputs (likes/votes/etc) weren't seen in the feeds of your followers (as explicit comments or whatever) but could still affect them - as in curating content for them?

we can crowdsource improvement proposals for any topic - for example feature requests for recommender algorithms for ANYONE to implement, and when they do, they can mark themselves there and users can migrate to them if they really care about that feature

What if anyone could analyze the history of reactions of a post and see if there was an initial coordinated boost by some clique of connected accounts from a troll farm? Currrntly such analysis can be done only by insider data analysts

> "These days, the problem isn't how to innovate; it's how to get society to adopt the good ideas that already exist." - [Douglas Engelbart](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/665712)

Identity can be computable





what if we could signal "back me up" for specific posts - leveraging our audience for select issues?

Feedback loop - you see what tags your audience expects and they see your content by tags if you’ve tagged it (or they could use AI to classify but that could be ambiguous)

We can show things in progress - suck as quitting smoking or participating in some challenge - justin.tv but with structured data

What if IDMs had to burn the native token when creating new accounts in a way similar to 1559? And what if this 1559 was not shared but per-idm? So that each IDM is throttled economically according to their own speed of growth?

In complex, modern societies, the relationship between reality and our representations of reality—between what Lippmann called the “real environment” and the “pseudo-environments” that make up our mental models of the real environment—is heavily mediated by complex chains of trust, testimony, and interpretation.

Instead, your beliefs are biased by motives and interests like self-aggrandisement, status-seeking, tribalism, and social conformity. Just as importantly, the people from whom you have acquired your information about the world are similarly flawed, fallible, and biased. In some cases, they were outright liars and propagandists, but most were simply influenced by the same mundane sources of motivated reasoning as you. For these reasons, [the truth is not the default](https://iai.tv/articles/misinformation-is-the-symptom-not-the-disease-daniel-walliams-auid-2690#:~:text=Against%20this%20picture%2C%20philosopher%20Daniel,that%20we're%20hoping%20for.) when people form beliefs about the world beyond their immediate material and social environment. Of course, in some sense, this should be obvious. Just as poverty is humanity’s default state throughout history, so are ignorance and misperceptions. At least relative to a modern scientific worldview, almost everything people have ever believed about the world they are not in close perceptual contact with has been completely wrong. Nothing is puzzling about this. The puzzle is that humans sometimes overcome the countless sources of error and illusion that distort beliefs and form accurate perceptions of how things are.
>
> **The sources of error**
>
> Why, then, do many approach social epistemology as if the deep question, the real puzzle, is why some people “believe in misinformation”? One answer is what psychologists call “[naive realism](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-97682-006).” Although our access to reality is heavily mediated, most people do not instinctively appreciate this. They treat their mental model of reality as an unproblematic mirror of nature, endorsing the attitude that: *“I see entities and events as they are in objective reality… [M]y social attitudes, beliefs, preferences, priorities, and the like follow from a relatively dispassionate, unbiased, and essentially “unmediated” apprehension of the information or evidence at hand.”* If you see things this way, then (what you take to be) false beliefs really do seem puzzling. If the truth is self-evident, why do people not hold true beliefs? They must be [crazy, deluded, or evil](https://dgardner.substack.com/p/fools-tools-and-liars). However, there is another, deeper reason: Just as citizens of modern, affluent societies take wealth—an extraordinarily fragile achievement—for granted, many take knowledge for granted. Today, educated people in affluent, liberal societies are beneficiaries of the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, and centuries of cultural and institutional development designed to overcome the many sources of ignorance and misperception in human judgement.
>
> ...
>
> **Taking knowledge for granted**
>
> ... And in some sense, these things are puzzling. Relative to the possibilities of knowledge and understanding in modern society, it is striking—and regrettable—that shocking forms of ignorance, misinformation, and misperceptions are so pervasive. However, in a deeper sense, this situation is not surprising. The more puzzling feature of modern societies is that many people reliably form accurate beliefs about distant, complex issues. Unless we understand this, we will fail to appreciate how impressive—and fragile—this achievement is. We will think—mistakenly—that ignorance and misperceptions are aberrations that require deep explanations, when they are instead the default state humanity will revert to in the absence of improbable and precarious norms and institutions.
>
> **Why does any of this matter?**
>
> ... I am [not a fan](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/misinformation-researchers-are-wrong) of the way in which so many journalists, social scientists, and commentators today use concepts like “misinformation” and “post-truth” to diagnose epistemic problems in society. There are [many](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/how-dangerous-is-misinformation) [reasons](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/should-we-trust-misinformation-experts) for this... it is partly because the modern panic about these things is historically illiterate. There never was a “truth” era. The dominant world religions are vast repositories of fake news and rumours; conspiracy theories are as old as humanity; and false, cartoonish, and biased narratives and ideologies are the norm throughout human history. However, it is also because I think locating modern epistemic problems in “misinformation” and related buzzwords is explanatorily shallow. Once you appreciate that the [truth is not the default](https://iai.tv/articles/misinformation-is-the-symptom-not-the-disease-daniel-walliams-auid-2690#:~:text=Against%20this%20picture%2C%20philosopher%20Daniel,that%20we're%20hoping%20for.)—that it is an exceptional, fragile, improbable achievement—it should shift how you approach social epistemology.
>
> First, it should encourage a conscious rejection of naive realism. The truth is not self-evident. Given this, those who claim to know the truth, including misinformation researchers, should have [more intellectual humility](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/should-we-trust-misinformation-experts) than they often have. Moreover, they should acknowledge that there are many sources of error, bias, and partiality in human judgement [distinct from misinformation](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sm3vk).
>
> Second, it should make us understand that lies, conspiracy theories, misinformation, bias, pseudo-science, superstition and so on are not alien perversions of the public sphere. They are the epistemic state of nature that society will revert to in the absence of fragile—and highly contingent—cultural and institutional achievements.
>
> Given this, the real epistemic challenge for the twenty-first century is not to combat misinformation, except insofar as doing this helps us achieve a deeper, more fundamental goal: **maintaining and improving our best epistemic norms and institutions, and winning trust in, and conformity to, them**." - [Why do people believe true things? by Dan Williams](https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/why-do-people-believe-true-things)

FEED CONSTRUCTION - we have robo advisors to help us allocate our money when investing, but what if we could have robo advisors on how to best allocate our attention based on our interests and/or goals?





THIS IS A BIG POINT !!!
what if I don't care about the specific expressions of someone, but would still like them to be taken into consideration when I'm consuming media - perhaps an aggregate of X people I follow can influence my recommendations?
Tweeting out an opinion is nice but the effects are extremely small. And you have to repeat it for more effect at the risk of alienating your followers. What if you could state it once and have the ability to alter the algorithms of people that choose your influence over their filtration?
book recommendations? How about inputting the people you respect and getting out a personalized list of recommendations?
what if this is not used just for recommendations, but also as a lens to score any piece of news & its significance? So if someone sends you directly some document you can quickly give it a relevance score & decide if its even worth inspecting?
This is how scientists can have an impact even if they're not good communicators - actions can speak louder than words

we should be able to say "don't notify me for likes/reactions - only comments"

What if we could signal what items we think are important and essential and input that in ads and recommendations?



index designs can be open sourced and crowdsourced - once the infra evaluates the index and calculates the cost.

indexes can be computed in steps, and different sets of steps can share the common steps and reuse those (intermediary) indexes




"notify me for new opinions or only for mentions in threads in which I've already participated in"




== The global connectome

Every single one of us could browse and inspect the global connectome
the sets of public preferences & votes & delegations is the global connectome
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome
"The significance of the connectome stems from the realization that the structure and function of the human brain are intricately linked, through multiple levels and modes of brain connectivity."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=The%20significance%20of%20the%20connectome%20stems%20from%20the%20realization%20that%20the%20structure%20and%20function%20of%20the%20human%20brain%20are%20intricately%20linked%2C%20through%20multiple%20levels%20and%20modes%20of%20brain%20connectivity.
"The foundation of human cognition lies in the pattern of dynamic interactions shaped by the connectome."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome#:~:text=the%20foundation%20of%20human%20cognition%20lies%20in%20the%20pattern%20of%20dynamic%20interactions%20shaped%20by%20the%20connectome.

this is the great unbundling of opinions (until now everything came in bundled groups represented by individuals and organizations - now we can crowdsource competence on any specific topic), followed by the ability to reconstruct specific media experiences with specific recommender algorithms defined by different values & collective consensus or interest heatmap

we have maladaptive connections and lack (neuro)plasticity. The global brain lacks (neuro)plasticity because of fractured identity & the inability to export data from service to service - lack of interoperability

In order to have collective consciousness we need to have global neurons. This is identity



we can put a price on any type of informational preference - it all depends on what kinds of indexes exist and how much they're charging. Apps will simply be interfaces that collect ad revenue and pay to the index maintainers for the ability to service their customers according to their explicitly stated desires



!!!
inherit algorithmic preferences
!!!

!!!
what if we could follow the best game theorists & geopolititians in telling us which papers & organizations out there have the best models that we should apply to defuse the whole thing
And what if we could act on their findings - choosing which filter to change or which new rule to add for our information diets - effectively being able to choose the best people for any given topic through crowd sourced reddit-style surface of the best or with the most consensus
!!!




we can crowdsource such filters by an average from a community and there can be many communities. These communities could have on-chain governance for how to control who is in a set. What if those communities that define the filters for others got the option to collect payments for them maintaining quality and seeking truth, and only those apps that consume them on infrastructure that is doing their bidding would have access to the output. Anyone could leak it but they'd effectively be doing a favor to anyone else? Maybe? But the payload could also be fingerprinted uniquely for every one of them that's paying for it so that if it leaks the rat would be identified.

we can have a service that maintains the verifiable credentials for something like KYC of those that have burned or donated funds to charity (a charity/enterprise/organization of their choosing, but publicly) - if you want to be a part of the global convo in an anonymous way you could simply pay and have your voice heard. And you can bring whatever proofs from the real world with you. So for the things we're not afraid of the public - we work in public so that we can generate a proof, and for the stuff we're concerned to speak up we'd simply prove that we're someone notable on the other side

we are starving for meaning and this project lays a path towards global meritocracy
immutability, reputation and the ability to see everything relevant to an identity or a specific event or a topic, when put together, produce an idea market & a meritocracy








we could precisely determine the amount of influence we'd want from any account and then feed that set of weights into different recommendation & scoring algorithms & indexes. If you aspire to be like a set of people - you could adopt their worldview - their news inflow, their beliefs for what's true, their trust network (those who they themselves follow)








youtube's reaction to swarm downvoting is "remove the count".
Disempowerment.
This system allows you to filter the count any way you want - empowerment.






We are so limited - we should be able to sort and filter spotify episodes based on views/engagement. All these apps provide us a limited sandboxed environment


What if we could tell recommender algorithms to avoid content about dieting for example? why not be able to include/exclude based on such types - even if we have just watched a video like that?


The current social media arms race is in harvesting attention & going to the bottom of the brain stem. What if the nature of competition is changed and the ones that offer the most choice for users (even if at the expense of reduced overall revenue) win?






https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_theory




== Computable context & SCORING

- we can compute truthfulness - or at least levels of alignment to a set of beliefs

what if we could see all the unique assertions a person has made (because some of them get repeated) and we could score them against that? What if we could analyze how their views changed throughout time?
we could do that by explicit semantic annotation with deduplicated concepts

what if we could analyze any piece of media for the degree of use of loaded/manipulative language?




duplicated content & concepts leads to less common knowledge as it is harder/impossible to join the data and produce aggregated views - leading to fractured views

context collapse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse

if we deduplicate most of the information and concepts our attention will be less fractured and we'd have more common knowledge
common knowledge is a critical component in cooperation

freeform text adds entropy and ambiguity due to the context collapse in the open web where strangers interact with each other without sharing the same cultural & linguistic backgrounds

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge



"deduplication & giving everything an ID"










we could have a quiz and give VCs to people that pass it and only count their votes in polls









What if people subscribed to specific types of events by others, in effect guiding them what to produce - even if they aren't already? If you saw that 90% of the interest in you is in financial opinions and not just shitposting - wouldn't you opine? Although this is a form of audience capture






chapter: what journalism would look like
== RESURRECTING/REVIVING/REINVENTING/reimagining JOURNALISM w/ reputation
- digital investigative journalism could be quantifiable & codified as algorithms - the role of people could be in building such algorithms/classifiers (which could be chained/imported like in DeSci) & narration
- anyone should be able to make new classifiers and apps should be free to use (or allow the use of) such classifiers
- we can co-create the mechanism for sorting through ideas publicly and directing capital what to be fixed next
- we need to be able to surface any kind of signal from public data
- we can have a trail (in the web of trust & sequence of events) of who was fraudulently trying to shut off an idea - this can act as an incentive to not publicly try to lie. we need to build the reputation machine, but one where reputation is multi-dimensional and we all participate & compete for competence in different aspects & verticals of society
- every nation and every official in the top seats of governments should have a public account with identity tied to his broadcasted public actions
- any public claim can be backed up by an accompanying algorithm that surfaces the signal behind the claim. And there's a record of which other identities are used as sources for the input data, and if the algo is indeed what it's said out to be
- Give the people the tools they want
- Competing knowledge graphs that you plug into Troogle (truth google)- see where they differ in what is true (left vs right?) - point from balaji
- imagine the kind of wikipedia we could build on top of the ledger of record
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_mainstream_encyclopedia
- With open data we can be more data driven and less narrative driven

be able to choose a truth provider & even selectively override entries

we should be able to apply something like birdwatch on the entire web - not just on tweets. We need software composability












Section: certifiable (verifiable?) credentials and attestations
granularity of verification? many verticals? a bouquet of attestations











deduplicating concepts and reusing them increases the efficiency & compactness of information. Common knowledge as unique concept/noun identifiers allows us to communicate more substance and interlink everything better
Common knowledge is important for efficient communication

context collapse - lack of provenance & the chain of custody of facts

we have the opportunity to deduplicate common knowledge (concepts, nouns, etc). into a set of unique stable identifiers

== ideas for apps:
- feed composer - from subscriptions - with pipes

Making physical location obsolete for the digital world

what if you used your own IDM but authorized a commercial IDM as a proxy for yours - to aggregate your actions along with those of others such that less fees are paid? or this is nonsense? there should be a way to proxy at least some bits to your own server...

streaming platforms will know how much you've watched something. They could sell that data. Apps that request it and mediate it could anonymize the user somehow? But the streaming service will have a direct IP connection with the user - unless the app acts as a bandwidth proxy?



what happens to auth tokens if you change your IDM?


What if IDMs issue the integers for credentials and they can upload onchain sparse bitmaps with these ids when revoking on behalf of users?


Think about making monetary settlements with zk proofs on top of ethereum for polls



separating the authorization (signature or authZ token) from the content is beneficial - can cache the authZ token once and reuse it for many data items



problem: fractured identities across platforms
Write about social media aggregator tools for creators - just a bandaid

Composition in DeFi pales in comparison to the opportunities around data & identity.

can't be evil - reddit's hot/new/top algorithms are no longer public & open source - why not? This makes Reddit as a voting system less democratic and more opaque
recommender systems are voting systems - user choice is effectively a vote that's fed through a feedback loop which affects what gets recommended to others as well. every user choice affects the available choices for others and the algorithms that do that are opaque - this is the opposite of democratic



democratizing access to what is public anyway - ending the host-centric model

the ability to toggle the display of highlights & interlinked objects - turning plain text into a wikipedia-like page



when ingesting data, infrastructure can map the "appId/nonce" pair to "block_height/appId"



global questions will have URIs that would be followable, with the option to filter notifications - for example "only financial news regarding X". We could have subscriptions such as "notify me when there's consensus by the current committee on this issue and then I'll trust you, but you have to work in public"


NFTs are overhyped - but VCs and attestations are not


Meme: fork in the road: host-centric status quo vs SSI and content addressing

being able to vote/react multiple times on a URI - with different scopes. Suppose you want to upvote a resource in one context but downvote it in another context - contextual reactions - within a domain/context !!!
context could be application/tag/campaign/post/etc.



So many ideas that can be implemented as a hackaton at any of the big social media companies are never even attempted - because it doesn’t serve their bottom line. Thats why the host-centric model must go

Logo/Cover photo idea: headjack which extends as a vortex/fractal of interconnectedness
