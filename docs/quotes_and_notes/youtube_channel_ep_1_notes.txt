Identity, networking, signals, reputation, incentives, relevance & voting - EP #1







- recap of my talk from 1 year ago in a more freeform way and without the rush - easier to listen to
- foundation for future EPs
- no blockchain technicalities today (in future EP)



- UX of web2, no practical scalability limitations, u fully own your identity (sovereign)

- single social graph
    - can build any functionality/social app on top of it
    - open ecosystem, anyone can extend
    - no API wall guarding
    - no predatory lock-in - facebook/messenger separation but not for instagram

- any type of signal/event - not just like/post/comment
    - structured data - enables easy aggregation without ambiguity

- fine-grained subscriptions - event type / app source / custom filter

- many custom feeds with different feed algos

- liquid democracy
    - direct vs representative

- public/private events, following settings/algo choices

- events vs state, multiperspectival, forking, competing views
    - how and which
        - votes to count
        - content to show

- deduplicating any concept/event/entity - like wikipedia pages or questions in SO/Quora
    - by humans & by algos
    - 1 unique identifier, many opinions attached to it

- debate maps for any question/argument - quora/SO

- fact databases

- RR/ranking/sorting
    - top 10/100 lists
    - aggregating the results (the top10 concerns list is unique/deduplicated and the concerns themselves are unique/deduplicated)

- query "everything relating to this" & filter the result set
    - I want just comments by PhDs in economics from X university
    - just opinions of certified doctors (can also be anonymous yet provable certification)
    - templates for positional scarcity when viewing X - what is most relevant
        - competing templates, can inherit templates from who u follow in a liquid-democracy style

- reputation - not just 1 number (follower count) but for any aspect - compartmentalized
    - democratic rules for how it is calculated
        - subjective objectivity
    - can stack/compose complex rulesets for calculating it
    - fork/branch off the rules for how reputation is determined if u want to

- why reputation?
    - leaderboards
    - higher voting power in a given domain
    - boost post visibility in algo feeds
    - monetary reward from common pool of funds

- collectives ranking brands/companies & using positional scarcity - democratic competing "ESG-like" scores
    - open more patents and data and internal documents/processes
    - don't engage in planned obsolescense
    - fix your cobalt supply chain
    - pay the open source projects you're using (multi-trillion dollar companies not paying a dime for many OSS they rely on - common tragedy of the commons)
    - reward: boost post visibility in algo feeds & reduced marketing spend



- will keep track of what's been discussed so far and fill the gaps in the future and make things more clear
