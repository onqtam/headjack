# DIFFERENT APPS
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

GLING VS DESCRIPT:
- filler word removal:
    gling has the best mistake removal
    gling: automatic & timeline-centric
    descript: manual & transcript-centric
- fixing wrong words
    descript: lets you change words in the transcript and overdub & crossfade them automatically with your voice using AI - but does it also do video - not just audio?


gling can export to davinci so I don't need to use their renderer (if it's shit - some say it is)

- eye contact:
    - descript - 35$ a month 
    - Captions.ai - 10$ month
    - CapCut - but seems a bit shitty


firecut.ai

captions.ai

descript export quality: bad?

# CHANNEL STUFF
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

uploading:
- don't immediately publish - wait for HD to be ready
- don't share with friends & unrelated audiences
- don't open it yourself and add fake views - leave it to the algo

channel:
- more professional
- what's the value prop
- avoid shorts - people who come from shorts don't stay long and give a bad signal to the algo
- check if more people come from search or other sources, if search is low - don't put too many keywords with high hopes
- look where people drop off from the video and maybe cut out those bad sections
- check if more people come from search or other sources, if search is low - don't put too many keywords with high hopes
- look where people drop off from the video and maybe cut out those bad sections

get the rug on the floor for less echo

video structure:
- hook (a question) + maybe a few sec of the most interesting part of the video + a very bold/provocative statement
- short intro (who am I and what are we doing)
- value (the content)
- end screen sales pitch - no "like/comment/sub" but redirect to another video & discord
- title & thumbnail set the expectation - the hook should meet it in the first 10 sec

lighting:
- close curtains - no natural light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm3jfS78AQg
- 3 lights: key/fill/back - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6W5wbPqzPw
- key (strongest) light from one side, fill (milder) light from the other
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFbiZIsS9vQ
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXWuy5lWw3M
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKt0NaMHCbM

== thumbnail & title
- contrasting colors
- face/emotion, or actually no need... only if can convey emotion, or actually no need... only if can convey emotion
- clear text & selective ALL CAPS for emphasis
- elicit an emotion
- needs to induce a curiosity gap & challenge the assumptions of the viewer
- don't put too much - takes more time to process by viewers

██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████


- internet 2.0
- fundamental upgrade to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and cognize/think together - collective cognition
- works on any scale - all the way up to the global level
- what would the best possible system we could come up with look like?
- the ultimate product/service is the ultimate social system and we're going to co-discover it
- what is the ultimate product/service? it is the ultimate social system.
- and what is better than a product that spreads by word of mouth? an ideology behind a product that spreads by word of mouth
- A protocol - fundamentally open and uncensorable with string user privacy
- A reversed panopticon
- Ladder of influence and legibility
- Opt-in
- Can scale to tens of billions and has no limitations on the amount of data
- True anonymity with zero knowledge - can even prove to be a real human and prove credentials in a privacy preserving way 
- Self organization
- this system is inevtable if it starts getting going
- Voting on rules of the game & specific issues - not parties and individuals
- Bottom up emergent regulation
- Architecture for cultural evolution
- The loss function of a hive mind
- A new incentive architecture that will eventually rival and regulate money itself
- Identity, reputation
- Social credit system
- Collective intelligence & aggregating creativity
- intelligence is always a distributed system - dofferentiation & integration & alignment - the whole more than the sum of the parts
- The ultimate meta system that can solve any problem
- Social operating system multi century old
- Language/writing/printing press
- An economy around solving real problems
- A new form of accounting for contribution and redistributing resources
- The fusion of state/market/academia/media/religion/education
- Reinventing governance and adding market discipline
- Solving alignment for people
- Final major evolutionary transition
- Atick around if you want to be early in the final battle between good and evil
- Digital id can go horribly/terribly wrong & orwellian or incredibly right
- The most flexible and scalable architecture for the evolution of culture and incentives
- Our system fails at conveying why we should care about others
    - why the wellbeing of others is in your best (expanded) self interest
    - Why others matter to us
- Program or be programmed
- As batman said…
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system

The most important developments this century are AI & CI



System fails at communicating why and how to care for others

We have all the pieces if the puzzle because of the great unbundling - all we need to do is the great integration

Ev has direction

A product worth dying for

The next OpenAI will be open collective intelligence

Thumbnail: ants / network

Nobody in the world has thought more about identity and reputation than me
No single person or group

Decentralized, infinitely scalable and with no UX limitations

Higher trust, thriving, health, vitality, alignment, meaning, purpose, accountability

Radical
Coherence
Consciousness
Babies
Attention regulation - respurce allocation
Deepmind
Unbundling the enlightenment
Rebubdling
Variation and selection
Democratically programmable currency, the end of fungibility
Less than 1k nukes before the end of the century
Opt-in, 0 violence
We are multiple orders of magnitude away from our potential with our current resource consumption and human capital
Participatory culture and social co-engineering
Program or be programmed - hivemind
Preserving individual rights and privacy
Optimal synthesis between individualism and collectivism

Current system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating


The intersection of digital id, incentives and collective intelligence

If you’re watching this - you’re early to something truly big - the right side of history will unfold before you

The ultimate metric is not gdp but the number of nuclear warheads in the world - we know with high certainty what happens in quasars millions of light years away and yet we can’t seem to figure out how to organize ourselves to not kill and cheat each other.

This system will wipe the floor with any other - nothing will be able to compete and every competing power structure will join in their best  newly understood and deeper self interest - not out of fear but through a combination of seduction, shame, and consensual indoctrination

The greatest open conspiracy

The window of transcendence will not be open for long
Satoshi opened it with his digital rock but it is just a toy
Welcome to the era of rules without rulers
a rules based order is an actual possibility for the first time in human history
