the infinite game
    To desire the ultimate social system means wanting a form of collective organization that perfectly harmonizes individual and collective flourishing — a system that:
        Fulfills all material and psychological needs,
        Maximizes freedom and creativity,
        Minimizes suffering and conflict, and
        Sustains itself and the planet indefinitely.
    It’s a desire for the ideal environment in which human (and perhaps non-human) potential can fully unfold.
    The ultimate social system is the most general enabler of all other desires.



Nervous system



we need an ideal towards which to strive towards - as a society, and as males and females



PP & FEP & Active Inference

We call things alive to the extent its cognitive light cone is bigger than than of its parts - michael levin


The upstream of the upstream


Where is the global handle/knob/lever on parameter X?

There is a way to own nothing and be happy
    I will own nothing and be happy and you'll choose for yourself how much you'd want to own
    Own nothing and be happy - well not really nothing… but less - by choice
freedom through constraint - bondage as a service - with X-s on nipples & with hands tied & apple/gag in mouth
    get Whipped - ask an F friend (or multiple) to do it - crush a carrot in mouth
        "you've been a bad boy!"
        "yes my queen"
        show hash on back, also show merkle tree with only "change W" revealed by pausing the whipping and overlaying it next to my back
        multiple angles - on my knees, face towards the wall, and lying on the ground, or being held by 2 of them
freedom & sovereignty are the foundation - you can have unfreedom within freedom, but you can't have freedom within unfreedom
    the world is fortunate to have the west with its freedoms - only we can give birth to such an ideology
    only the west could become pregnant with this system - this is a testament for the liberties we enjoy
    The west is the best because only the west can deliver the best
    Freedom is fundamental
    everything we do will be legal, moral, and easily auditable
you can't build something decentralized on centralization - only the other way around - you can build something centralized on top of decentralization

whether something is important depends on whether we can do something about it - how viable/realistic/costly it is, what the odds are

cooper from interstellar: "It's not possible". "No, it's necessary".


Differentiation and specialization coupled with alignment and integration

anything that's altruistic needs to be rewarded (making it no longer altruistic)

Aggregation

a new game the likes of which we could have never even conceived


no ceiling for personal consumption
the status game has no limits in resource use

intro: this video is the culmination of 4 years of work

something larger than ourselves that will persist beyond our lives

- internet 2.0
- fundamental upgrade to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and cognize/think together - collective cognition
- works on any scale - all the way up to the global level - the same stack works on global/national/city/party/company level
- what would the best possible system we could come up with look like?
- the ultimate product/service is the ultimate social system and we're going to co-discover it
- what is the ultimate product/service? it is the ultimate social system.
- and what is better than a product that spreads by word of mouth? an ideology behind a product that spreads by word of mouth
- A protocol - fundamentally open and uncensorable with strong user privacy
    Total privacy for individuals and complete transparency for organizations
- A reversed panopticon
- Ladder of influence and legitimacy (legibility?)
- Opt-in - Turn on, tune in, drop out
- Can scale to tens of billions and has no limitations on the amount of data
- True anonymity with zero knowledge - can even prove to be a real human and prove credentials in a privacy preserving way
- Self organization
- this system is inevtable if it starts getting going
- Voting on rules of the game & specific issues - not parties and individuals - subjective objectivity
- Bottom up emergent regulation
- Architecture for cultural evolution
- The loss function of a hive mind
- A new incentive architecture that will eventually rival and regulate money itself
- Identity, reputation
- Our focus should be on mechanism design
- Social credit system/score - when you've been a bad boy!
- Collective intelligence & aggregating creativity
- intelligence is always a distributed system - dofferentiation & integration & alignment - the whole more than the sum of the parts
- The ultimate meta system that can solve any problem
- Social operating system multi century old
- Language/writing/printing press
- An economy around solving real problems
- changing property - and no, this isn't simply socialism or communism
- A new form of accounting for contribution and redistributing resources
- The fusion of state/market/academia/media/religion/education
- Reinventing governance and adding market discipline
- Solving alignment for people
- Final major evolutionary transition
- Atick around if you want to be early in the final battle between good and evil
- Digital id can go horribly/terribly wrong & orwellian or incredibly right
- The most flexible and scalable architecture for the evolution of culture and incentives
    read my lips: NO LIMITS, NADA
- Our system fails at conveying why we should care about others
    - why the wellbeing of others is in your best (expanded) self interest
    - Why others matter to us
        Our system doesn’t simply fail at explaining why other people matter - it doesn’t even try
    System fails at prioritisation which depends on accounting of contribution and causal links
    Its time to start adressing the root of all problems instead of symptoms
- Program or be programmed
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system

The most important developments this century are AI & CI

The most important diffusion model/architecture diffuses knowledge in populations optimally for them to thrive


collective intelligence - If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Thrives


LLMs are good at connecting known dots, not creating new dots
They navigate - not create/invent
TODO not sure about this


System fails at communicating why and how to care for others
convincingly

We have all the pieces of the puzzle because of the great unbundling - all we need to do is the great integration

frame control & manipulation

the highest form of nationalism is seeking the best ways to integrate and cooperate with others - to be part of a larger whole
    if you care about your nation you should ultimately care about the world
    but also to enforce accountability within your nation - integration with others doesn't mean open borders where anything goes - it's about rules and accountability and trust (and boundries?)

everyone is preoccupied with their corner of reality and almost nobody sees or understands the big picture

Permanent record, but for those with the most influence - if we'll be legible to the system - the system should be legible to us - it's only fair

meritocracy

the market myth - constitutive vs the other rules

when there isn't huge wealth to steal there's less need for security and worry



> "Any company where the world would be better if it didn't exist - we should figure out how to have it not exist." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/JTz4Mncy1u0?t=4245)

people think of the iron hand (gesture - a shake of the hand) and the invisible hand (gesture - money with hand) but they rarely think of the intangible hand of status

built-in error correction as the highest priority

New motivation/mobilization system

Self justifying

Regulating and steering desire and consumption through culture - redefining status

Sensemaking


Open society

Deep democracy
1 man 1 vote only on the base constitution which defines the inequality in the other layers
The end of 1 man 1 vote - democratic inequality of influence, we all get an equal vote about what else to not have an equal vote on
slaughter of sacred cows
    Roleplay killing a sacred cow
Oh! I'm an Inequality Designer myself!
Popper quote we are all equal in our infinite ignorance
we will have equality in our vote only about the inequality of our vote

What should we be coherent around and what not, and how do we determine the boundry and also truth

No single person or group in the entire world has thought as much as me about the intersection of …
^^ early in the clip

we can turn a competitive disadvantage into a competitive advantage - we can change the cultural landscape

perfect? no! better? yes!

People are just brought up into existence with an empty script of "go through school and get a job"
We need a hitchhikers guide to conscious existence

Just because something is legal and makes money does not automatically make it ok

Wherever there’s a capacity for choice - there are better and worse options. We need people to understand that this applies to everything and we need a theory of progress and of what is good and we need people to want to make the better choice and to inform themselves about it and how it was derived and how to improve the system that derived it
We might be wrong but thats just an opportunity for error correction - the need is still there even if its currently wrong
This includes even every aspect of how we raise kids

How do we achieve mass self-actualization?
To be, to contribute, to be recognized? And appreciated and loved?

Education doesn’t end with school

Value coding society



Later on:
But is there an MVP or a demo you BBC can try? Why not?
…
And in fact this is the architecture in which we’ll co-create our story

Cultural enlightenment or bust
Protopia or bust
Showing the video with daniel & brett
& a petri dish bust graphic
== the stakes
- the future of life on earth depends on this - a crossroads between the 2 types of digital identity


We’re gonna make “ought” great again

We did not evolve for such a complex society - we either build the systems to scaffold our capacity upward or we perish
We are the most basic form of general intelligence - the lower bound

An open and integrated system is one in which every problem has to be solved just once and reused

What is the best argument for what makes a good argument?
    Argument ==> explanation
What is the best way to determine what is best?
What is the best incentive structure to improve the incentive structure?
How do we make common knowledge what common knowledge is and why it is important for coordination?
How do we innovate on how we innovate such that we don't cause even bigger problems down the road when we solve problems? How do we better factor (account for) all externalities and foresee a few steps out - a few levels of indirection and not just the immediate stuff?
    how do we better innovate in how we innovate, such that we don't cause bigger problems down the road when we solve problems now? how do we factor in all externalities and 2nd & 3rd order effects?
How do we better educate as many people as possible about the logic of better educating as many people as possible? (as best as possible)
    How do we better educate as many people as possible about the logic of this system that would scale and improve this education?
How do we best identify what is worth identifying?
    ^^ this isnt that good/recursive
Vote on how to vote on everything else
we will judge how to judge
How do we get people more interested in being more interested in general?
we need to be on the same page & coherent on what we need to be on the same page & coherent and how we determine where the boundry is
Moje bi trqbva da e “how do we get on the same page on/about what/how/why we should be on the same page on/about?”
how do we better help people become better?

everything is a tradeoff - how do we tradeoff how we make tradeoffs? this line needs more work

How do we shortcut the young into competence and engagement with the real economy instead of made up useless and meaningless hoop-jumping tasks?

Retarding the youth for profit is a crime against humanity on the grandest of scales

How do we cultivate a better culture

Authority and legitimacy, deference, trust

What are the most fundamental aspects of pur reality? No, i don’t mean quantum mechanics or some shit like that - i mean of immediate practical utility for everyone

A new form of collective expressivity

We need to suck creativity out of our culture and feed it back in
The culture that we cultuvate

Where life has reached is extraordinary

We are here to put a dent in the universe

The fact that we still kill each other is absurd
The universe is literally ours - all we have to do is simply not squander it

Who are we, what are we, why are we here?
“WHY ARE WE HERE?”
Stare into the camera
We can engineer scarcity
We can direct desire
What are we?
What is experience itself?
What are we as a species?
What is our role in the universe?

life is an infinite game where the point is to keep playing

We are all going to - probably - die
And what do we want to tell the future generations about our current capacity for dreaming and imagination and creativity and values and aspirations


Life births the concept and need for meaning
To a stale and more monotonous universe
We are the universe looking at itself

We are the most important thing in the universe

Make the case for life’s struggle evolutionarily to stat away from equilibrium
To be something against the monotony of space and time


Structure of organization & the universe

We can invent something bigger than money itself

What are we and what our place in the universe is

“The (collective) reward function”

We need to replace charisma with competence

Coherence about how and about what to have coherence about

There is such a thing as raising kids optimally



this is not capitalism, not communism or socialism or fascism or anarchism or any kind of ism or shism we've ever had - this is something new! like entirely new! like ... it didn't exist before! like ... a synthesis of everything we've learned and we're pushing forward! We can have new things, you know...

alignment & accountability on the record ==> end hypocrisy
what is integrity?

Now this is really dangerous for our democracy

We need a simplification of our system in a way that translates across scales
Talk about the isomorphic patterns


Adjudication

transparent monetary flows



Sunlight is the best disinfectant


We need to replace rhetoric with provable competence and skin in the game

“And how do u find/get it?”

A seamless game-like interface to the whole economy

The reward function

Everyone should understand as much as possible of the most important aspects of how and why society functions - and this sounds incredibly obvious and yet our current system is nowhere close to actually aiming towards that
In order to maintain, debug and improve it
We should be aiming at making everyone as useful and thriving as possible
Captain Obvious strikes again! (And I hit a piece of paper with my notebook like a baseball)
This is the value of others

every problem would benefit from more integration, more feedback (anyone can chime in) and a ability to filter those opinions in flexible & creative ways for signal

This system will absorb humanity’s wealth through donation and seduction - fundamentally non violent

The only way to deal with the ever increasing complexity is through compression and better explanations and incentives

integration, consistency, lack of incongruence, lack of Contradiction & conflicting statements


We need to aim the system at developing people

The dick measuring contest has no upper limit - roleplay a sword fight with your johnson - or multiple bananas tied to each other to be long

stop it! stop thinking of just capitalism and communism or socialism! The state space is not even just the continuum between them - the design space is vast and multidimensional!
morpheus - free your mind!
more capitalistic than capitalism & more socialistic/communistic than socialism/communism
"yeah but it still sounds like communism!"
STOP IT!
and no, it's not about "tAx ThE RICh" - it's about socially engineering the rich/elite! (and everyone else)
    convince the rich that there are better uses of their wealth and that there isn't such a need for control - convince them that there is a new status game in town - hold the moral high ground - be so high you don't even know where you are!

if it turns out a single individual can outperform any form of collective intelligence and governance and can revolutionize multiple industries in the trillions - so be it! I WELCOME single individuals commanding tens of trillions of capital for the benefit of all - as long as they've earned it through competence and alignment and that there are accountability measures in place.


The real hunger games is about who can provide the most nutritious food to as many people as possible

Explain how a new parallel economy will form and outcompete and swallow the current one along with incentives to join it and tarriffs

What is a multipolar trap
Tragedy of the commons
The greatest multipolar trap is about how much we personally consume

This is what real progressivism looks like

how do we generate the best possible answers and explanations to as many important questions and problems as possible? and share them as widely as possible? make them as accessible as possible? How do we incentivise their dissemination as wide as possible?
How do we rank and sort and prioritize things?

A sane society/civilization would be actively striving to lift as much people as possible out of poverty and to educate them and harness their creativity and intelligence for synergistic problem solving for all

Money got us here, but it will not get us there

It aint easy to bootstrap a network effect and reach billions and
Nobody has ever made something bigger than money

We need to reinvent how we do debate in the digital age - in a structured and explicit way

There absolutely are ways of redistributing wealth in a way that doesn’t make the receivers ungrateful and lazy and entitled - we just havent figured out how to do it yet
And also how to compensate those that generate the extra surplus that doesn’t go all to them and have them be not simply willing but genuinely eager to participate in something greater than themselves
instead of redistributing which requires taking which feels less pleasant than gaining feels pleasant - what if people didn't accumulate that much resources for personal consumption in the first place? what if they were compensated in different ways?
what if there was a system that actually deserved your taxes / fair share, one which is more efficient even than markets as they exist today? people don't want to get taxed not only because they want more for themselves, but also because governments are the biggest wasters in the world
loss aversion - loss hurts like a BEEP

we (this new system) don't want to be voted into government - we don't need it - we'll simply make an alternative that people will eventually flock to - one which delivers the goods and outperforms the current system on EVERY SINGLE METRIC worth outperforming
This system will wipe the floor with any other - nothing will be able to compete and every competing power structure will join in their best  newly understood and deeper self interest - not out of fear but through a combination of seduction, shame, and consensual indoctrination
subjugation through reason alone

and hey - I'll practice what I preach - I'll be the first to opt-in to this system and I will not be a billionaire or eventually a trillionaire, I'll consume according to the personal curve and I'll strive to steer as much cultural and economic capital as I deserve and have earned - according to the second curve - and all of that accounting will happen on this reputational system - the new arena - colosseum - this is what it means to be in the arena
one of the twitch founders initially live-streamed his whole life 24/7 and that was the entire website - his personal livestream, I will live-report my spending and ownership in a completely transparent way in this new property regime

the many will evaluate the few instead of the few evaluating the many
    We should be evaluators

the problem is not selfishness or ego - it is having too small of a self

we are finite systems with finite resources and how we prioritize and steer our attention (our most precious resource - even more precious than time or maybe even energy) is everything

"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." — Goethe

Talk about love
love is a fundamental truth of reality
truth is more important than life itself because it underpins it - there is no life without truth because life is a self-perpetuating process that uses knowledge for its maintenance, propagation, and reproduction
Life depends on truth because it is built on truth - an accurate description of its environment in the form of knowledge
without truth being the highest value you might end up hurting what you love the most without even realizing it

We perceive the world through our mental models
How to explain this the best way and how to uplift the best mental models?
Witgenstein quote limits of language

A paradigm is a framework of beliefs, assumptions, and practices that shapes how people or a community understand and interpret the world. It acts as a model or pattern for a discipline or group, influencing everything from scientific research and problem-solving to a company's business strategy. In simpler terms, it is a way of seeing and approaching things, like the difference between a model of a thing versus an actual thing. 

Division of labor - sight and recognizing edges & features

The body cannot live without the mind - matrix quote - about society becoming conscious

Consumption beyond a certain level is immoral and harder to justify
Private jets should be only for those who need them to be as productive for society as possible - not for leisure - where I’m going there will still be private jets, but only for those who can justify or make a compelling case why it makes sense for the collective for them to travel faster and easier and more securely in space and time - A private jet can be perfectly moral - but a private super-yacht can not

Its not simply muh freedom that makes capitalism successful - there are specific aspects of it that matter most - like control and circumventing committees/consensus and responsibility and market feedback

Postmodern horror - you’re so busy taking shit apart but when did you build something?

Every regime should be aiming to be so spectacularly successful that everyone else would voluntarily want to merge with them

Taxation is theft only if you’re getting ripped off by a decrepit and morally bankrupt system

Im a humble - laugh (spit out water) - public servant - not a private individual - and im not calling for everyone to be as extreme as me - I'm actually pretty reasonable (believe it or not) - but I want to set an example and point towards the north star - this is my social contract
not advocating it for everyone - and not the real north star - people should have the option to have personal privacy - uhh its complicated and tbd
Consumption beyond a certain level simply is immoral

the left-right political tug of war is literally the complete opposite of alignment (which is to point in the same direction) - its orthogonal - make a gesture - duverger's law

The meta solution to all of our problems is an incentive architecture for truth to reliably bubble up to the top
Ruthlessly incentivising truth

we need to optimize the means of production and steer the desires of consumption - but not through legislation but through cultural regulation (not wokery) - what we will seize is the memes of enculturation

    the only way out is through
A complexity catastrophe is a phenomenon in complex systems where a sharp decline in performance or fitness occurs as a result of pervasive interdependencies between a system's components. This concept, popularized by biologist Stuart Kauffman, suggests that while some complexity is beneficial, too much can lead to a breakdown of adaptation or functionality, making the system highly vulnerable to failure.

> "How does society work? Five words or less: Behavior is determined by incentives... The particular arrangement of incentives across time, space, and causality is called an incentive structure.
>
> ... What about free will? It’s the ability to respond to our incentives. Being a good person? It’s having an incentive to behave in ways we call “good”—that is, wanting to win the virtue game... Let’s give this worldview a name. Let’s call it incentive determinism. Incentive determinism is obvious. It’s just a bunch of tautologies: we are who we are, we want what we want, and we do what we’re caused to do. And yet, barely anybody thinks this way. It’s a cold, alien way of thinking... We spend very little time discussing which incentive structures are the best, and tons of time talking about which sets of words are the right words and which sets of people are the right people. It’s why we write words at all: we think we’re the right people with the right words, and if we just say those words loudly enough, we’ll improve the world.
>
> ... People don’t like incentive determinism because it’s disorienting. It tells us that our single greatest obsession, likability, is a distraction. It’s bullshit—a destroyer of insight, an enemy of understanding. It plays no special role in explaining how the world works. All it does is give us the illusion of understanding—the feeling of superiority to our apparently unlikable rivals (another big incentive for us)—while leaving us in ignorance of the causal structure of the world.
>
> And that causal structure is everything. If there are powerful incentives to help others, then even “evil” people will help others. If there are powerful incentives to hurt others, then even “good” people will hurt others. In fact, if being a “good” person just means being strongly incentivized by others’ moral approval (i.e., really wanting to win the virtue game), then good people are more likely to hurt people when it wins them moral approval. The “good” members of ISIS are the ones who bravely volunteer to commit suicide bombings, and the “bad” members of ISIS are the ones who cravenly fail to make the ultimate sacrifice. People are only as good as their incentives.
>
> But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe figuring out how this all works—understanding the machinery of society—can, itself, change our incentive structures. Insight is a thing in the world that human primates evolved to want, at least sometimes.
>
> If there’s any hope to be found in this cold, alien view of the world, it’s this: the more we all become aware of our incentive structures, the more incentivized we will be to choose them wisely... If we're collectively aware of our incentive structures, and aware that others know that we're aware, then we have an incentive to pick one that makes everyone better off, so that people won't judge us as selfish. So the key is achieving widespread awareness, or common knowledge, of our incentive structures... we're trying to explain the part of reality that is not random. That is all we can do. And when we look at that part, incentives are everything.
>
> ... I don't see incentive determinism as a "theory" so much as a different way of thinking, or a useful conceptual framework. It's honestly just a way of activating a different part of the brain--the tool-use part--to understand society as a machine of moving parts. It's more of a metatheory, really, or a useful way of coming up with other theories. It can give rise to more specific theories about the incentive structures we face, and how they work, which can then be tested. Insofar as the theories it gives rise to are always false, then, sure, it's false. But given that incentive-based thinking lies at the heart of economics and much of social science (not to mention evolutionary biology), it seems like a pretty damn good metatheory and I don't know of a better one. I cannot even conceive a better one, to be honest." - [Incentives Are Everything, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/incentives-are-everything)

We need to give an offramp - a redemption arc to those that have wrong us - otherwise they will cling to power. If a better system is inevitable - why prolong it by fighting and punishing. Tit for tat with forgiveness beats tit for tat in a repeated prisoners dilemma. The greatest jubilee should not be a debt jubilee but a moral one - start opening your books and you will be forgiven everything, but only if you go all the way and migrate completely to transparency and openness within a specific timeframe.
I'll personally be pushing for forgiveness to organizations that come clean regarding past misalignments as long as they transition to the new system
From this point onward - align or fade into itrelevance
if the new economy is inevitable - retribution will only slow its manifestation as it adds friction and tension
Revenge is stupid - strategic forgiveness is smart - in regards to past misalignment

openness would allow for prediction "markets" for any aspect of any business or organization - incentives and competence are universally necessary!

Universal basic opportunity

Universal basic humble pie - full accounting of your votes and decisions

truth to power as a service

Do we want to collectively incubate a whole cohort of human potential and creativity by redirecting surplus their way in the name of something greater than ourselves?

The answer is not 42 - it is having children. Creating what you want to be replaced by.
Biological children. Cultural children - both one-to-many and one-to-one
The ability to upload yourself is not about our conscious experience but about the continuity of our identity and soul

Startup civilization
    Startup civilisation - what is civility, what is moral is necessary - morality underpins civilization - we ought to synthesise “is” and “ought” - their separation must end - they were unbundled, and now we are re bundling
There are only 2 ways to make money bundle/unbundle quote
Think about how these things are connected linguistically and conceptually

The public goods knowledge market
A market for knowledge

Books property


In the next few years we will explore every single aspect of this system and its potentialities

The real virtue signal

What is our great replacement theory? What do we want to leave after we’re gone? What kind of world? What kind of people? What kind of ideas? What kind of art?

We need to apply RR collectively at scale

You might not agree with X - it is impossible to convey everything and convince everyone of everything in 60 minutes, but rest assured - you would be convinced of everything by the end of the journey in this channel
Month by month we will co-create the next world religion

What if we started pattern matching our best ideas together? How do we optimally let ideas have sex? How do we create the large idea collider? - make a gesture with your hands

You need a theory of progress and a causality map in order to implement the comparison operator
In computer science if you want to sort you need a comparison operator
understasnding is deeply related with causality
causality => dependency graph

The older the problem - the older the solution.
Multicellular Cooperation, coherence, consciousness, prediction/anticipation & modelling the world

if you vote as a dummy - eventually your vote will be weighted accordingly as a dummy - and actually you should want that as it's ultimately in your best interest

there is always a path for reputational redemption through competence and alignment and integrity, and we're all a dummy in some areas anyway

This bad boy (jesus - the cross) was onto something - he’s got a point


god is one, undivided, eternal - god is the attractor of collective unification on every level - for cells it is us, for us it is a harmonious society

“Moral high ground as a service” as a title

Skill trees


how do we have power without corruption?

society as an organism - from fascism - and yet we speak of organs of society - institutions - educational system, government, economy, religion, legal system
institutions: rules, roles & enforcement of those rules that structure human interaction - including habits, practices & values
examples: markets, marriage, corporations, legal system (also specific courts as specific sub-institution), journalism, higher education, regulatory bodies, etc. - organizations are specific instantiations of institutions
they structure relationships to avoid conflict, avoid opportunistic behavior, etc.

Fix the epistemic commons - fix the world

Justice depends on truth, consequentiality and understanding



Is cannot be so easily separated from ought
As much as there “is”, there is just as much“ought”

Gambling - legal? But is it moral? How about those that are associated with it - either directly or indirectly? Are they moral? How many things are legal but immoral?

Wealth is for you only up to a certain point - and beyond a certain point it starts becoming more and more for others because that would ultimately loop back to you in ways you couldn't get any other way


Talk about 2018 in peru
It was pure emotion - pure love - the thought of that other conscious light
That ceremony I realized that there are things worth dying for because there are worse things than death
Mention the unbearable potential crisis and 2023 aya

I’ll take a bullet, a knife and a poison for your right to sovereign identity and to represent, expand, and self-organize yourself as an individual in a collective
They can’t do anything to me because there is no me.
You can’t kill me - I’m already dead (The first time I died was in 2018 in Peru) and I’ll live forever
I’ll take a bullet for you - whoever you are - because of your potential
There can only be peace through culture
I’ll take a bullet for you to be sovereign with your identity
a bullet, a knife, a poison
MY LIFE DOES NOT BELONG TO ME
My life is not mine - it's yours, and you are me - you and me are the same

I felt for the first time that I loved something more than my own existence - my concept of the good. Wait what?

Coherence around truth - that’s collective consciousness

I’ve come to terms with death, although I do have hope

“The farewell”

Join the game! We will have kids! We will be happy! We will be fulfilled! We will be creative!

We need an NPC-friendly environment - where 

“You don’t have time” - how I wonder whether this means no time in the world or in your own life that’s about to end
    and it actually depends on you in either case - you can help make this a cultural phenomenon and can help make it inevitable and for it to pick up on its own - rendering me obsolete - we can put the current system in the position of "if you can't beat them - join them"

God is “the word” of others

We need to fuse our understandings

What does it take to be an intelligent collective


Intellectual property are the dirtiest of words

“The word” is priceless - we should strive for it no matter what

There’s this track… “you don’t have time” and every time I hear it I think about the tradeoff how much further to develop this before going public with it

Church - a place where we go to be something bigger than ourselves

How do we best debate right from wrong?

Without god you are just one small “You”
To be something more - manifest god

Psychedelics expand the consciousness by expanding the self - seeing yourself as part of the larger whole - it is the quieting of the “self” part in your brain. And by expanding the self they see further backwards and forwards

Virtue as a service

There’s a new god in town

There is no intellectual property because patterns and concepts are from another world - you don’t own concepts


Sell the rich taxation as a service! Offer them to etch their names in eternity

We co-construct our ontology

Sign up - come and get taxed!

“My word” as a service - the only way to alignment

By giving your word you begin to serve

You serve truth by reporting your experience as unbiased a spossible

We need to implement “the word” for people if we want them to keep it (their word)

Only an “other” would mislead. Only a misaligned other would distort the truth. Find the other that distorts the truth the least.

The depth of consciousness is the depth (up and down) of the light cone it cares about.

Imagine the ultimate event to not be burning man but at the most important and … what? To be in Petra or somewhere like that - where people present their impact reports in the agora

Truth is the ultimate schelling game

Fuck the bitcoin standard - the higher standard! Higher standard as a service

The opposite of truth is a falsehood and it signifies a barrier - an other. There is an epistemic/informational boundry - a separation. And it has literally robbed you for truth. Truth is you, falsity is other - falsity is misalignment - truth is relational - what is the truth about if we are hurting each other?

This is my submission on the paper “governance as a service”

Opt-in taxation - Taxation as a service - be glad you get to contribute and give till it hurts

If you don’t serve anything you are small and all alone. By serving something greater than ourselves we 

If you don’t serve transparency, openness and truth you won’t have them

Effectively i’m trying to convince you that this is an inevitability by simply offering something worth wanting - the universal relation to the other - wait what did I just write

Under - stand - the importance of foundation on top of which to stand and trust

This is the trust network

The more you give to the truth - the closer and faster you get to it
Give till it hurts


The (explicit) status economy

We feel robbed by taxation because we don’t trust and love the system - because it is not worthy of those things. How do we add them? I’m telling you how!

Justice recalculation

Morality comes with religiosity

The only real insurance is to live as a part of a society

And since you comprise god as contributing to his awareness - you …

What entity is alive? One that has goals, that is aligned with itself and is aimed at self-preservation and growth?

I literally applied the algorithm of the system to construct it

What happens to corruption when it sees a system that will replace it? The more inevitable it is - the less they fight it. Simple as that

“The Public” - not simply a republic

Life is not for you - life is for your kids and for others - life is for culture - life is for others, and that ultimately is you - you are everyone - you are one

Culture is alive - each culture has a god - an ultimatum - or they’re not a peoples at all

Governance as a service

World government as a service

Renouncement of property by contributing it to a better system of governance is the highest virtue

We should solve the financing of public goods - we should literally figure out how best to redirect society’s status and incentives and let it sort itself put - as long as we put money as our god we don’t serve something higher and bigger than ourselves but we serve ourselves only

As long as you don’t actively want to give to a set of people or tribe you belong nowhere -

morpheus quote: "Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something... What you know you can't explain, but you feel it - you've felt it your entire life. I imagine that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Hm?" ... "It is the world that's been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth." - what truth - that you're a slave, Neo

the gods of the past were collective imaginaries, those of the future are inevitable realities/actualities

If God is constituded by you - if you’re a part of him and his existence depends on you - you don’t have to eat his flesh and drink his blood in the form of wine because you simply are him
The truth is we don't know why the universe exists. Be honest - we don't really know! We don't know if there is a creator


How do we not completely destroy the innate curiosity and agency in kids - how do we end this mass lobotomization - it makes me sick - games are their only outlet and its a meaningless shadow career
How do we not mutilate/lobotomize curiosity and agency out of kids and people? - roleplay mashing potatoes as the brain - nice and homogenous - just the way I like my industrial era workers - obedient, docile, impotent, harmless, predictable, manipulatable, manageable, sterile of independent thought - the texture is perfectly homogenous - 0 variance, all compliance - little timmy's head as a cup from which I take out the brain,  I blend it and I pour it back in and taste it like hummus. Jumping through hoops - roleplay jump through a ring very awkwardly

How to present a concept: title, short descr, long descr, a few examples, how this fits in the overarching causal hypergraph, how these things were chosen, ability to filter opinions about any aspect of something

Predict - anticipate

Integration - the moment an argument gets overturned everything downstream needs to be notified immediately and reevaluated to remove any inconsistencies

A system built on private (intellectual) property is inherently corrupted

Its not the genes that matter most - its the culture - and that is why we ought to love the children of others - because they host the culture neuronally in their heads

There is no moral landscape - there is only moral topology/graph

If you're not trying to correct at least some problems with "your side" - you're part of the problem

CC - down to the point of throwing something out

Understanding >> IS << causal
Understanding runs/happens on causal conceptual graphs or on directed weighted graphs - or maybe even a hypergraph - “what is the name of a graph in which nodes can be connected to entite subgraphs of the graph”

Give till it hurts - I know I have/will - I sure will

Do you understand what I am telling you?  We need cultural coherence - we need to produce coherence - 

Selfishness vs selflessness - no - the question is about expanding the self

There is no culture war - there is only divide and conquer

The only worthy war is with unaccountability and corruption


“But people don’t want to consume the important stuff - they just want entertainment” - so find the best way to convince them why that is important. That belief is already in you - there is a path for a human brain to find it and to be compelled by it.

Truth - if you see an apple is red - you can’t force yourself to believe the apple isn’t read - you can’t bullshit yourself. You can in more subtle ways with biases, but for the most apparent things you just cant. We need to build the same collectively and with as little bias as possible

Truth is also about logical consistency which requires integration of information so any contradictions stand out to be resolved.

I want the truth! And we will handle it

We are all partially a form of a language & status model

To properly align a language model towards truth you need a status model aligned towards truth to give the proper weights for the LLM training data based on source status

Society and status in monkeys - they each have a status matrix - first row is how X views everyone else, and the columns are how X thinks each one from each cell in the top row views everyone else

We can make a prediction system with no leverage - so less volatility and noise

The more important something is - the more accessible it should be - even in the sense of being easy to consume and understand

We need a shared global layer of trust, representation and identity

Why hierarchy is structurally fundamental
The ancients showed us that a hierarchy is the most stable and transcendental - we need to build an integrated informational pyramid and achieve coherence and resonance

Without CA a system cannot learn - lunacy is doing the same thing and expecting different results

Write how you’ll go about writng the book 

We need to reinvent marketing

Nested spirituality - you within a higher spirit

Integrity - whole, undivided, openness, trust, no contradictions, congruence

Non-violent and non-coercive and no -manipulative

If there’s nothing you want to give to - I’m truly sorry for you - it must be miserable to be so small, alone, isolated, vulnerable, ephemeral, transient, mortal, and self-obsessed - that’s sad
Give till it hurts
The only measure of life is how much you’ve given (and created)
    because life is fundamentally collective & cooperative
    and the best way to maximize your impact is by contributing to the public commons because the greatest synergy and emergence happens there
How others feel around you and how much you’ve helped them


Love, truth, integrity, ego, wholeness - related - point from actualized.org integrity episode
Truth is integrity, it has no room for contradictions
But without openness there can be no guarantee for logical consistency and thus integration, + withholding information is partial truth

If there are 2 unintegrated things - the sum of truth they have is LESS than what it would be if they were integrated into one

And the ego of each of these 2 unintegrated things does not want to integrate because that would lead to the realization that it didn’t have the full truth before - point from actualized

Causality - if people fully understood the long term consequences & causality of lying & corruption and how it ultimately will harm what they love - they would lie less
And even if not lying or corrupt - you might still not realize what you’re hurting if you don’t have the full picture

Why do we find people with integrity beautiful? Because beauty is truth and love - actualized

Who is integrity dangerous to? Integrity is truth.  To those without integrity, because on top of integrity can be built something greater than them and defeat them

How do we better apply science to science?

Accountability - measurement, quantity, magnitude

Love is no self, selflessness, no boundaries, non-duality, one oneness, infinity - or not really

You can’t have fairness and justice without accountability which requires transparency and integration

what are banks & finance ultimately for? to grow wealth & the economy. What should finance look like?

if there is no symmetry between consequentiality and responsibility/accountability there is no fairness or justice

Shared intentionality & joint attention - separates us from the apes

You probably have a lot of questions - so do I !!!
There are many things I haven’t thought through, but I’ve fully thought through how to (optimally) think through anything!

What are the top lists of structuring top lists?

Epistemology - how do we know what we know?

How much inefficiency & wrongdoing is never identifies simply because it is invisible behind IP walls?

Its all interconnected, folks - its our job to make that explicit

the art of *~~living~~* **governance**

The Myth of the Rational Voter, for the argument that voters have no incentive to have rational political opinions.

> "I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds. I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate. I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being." - [Steve Jobs email to himself, 2010](https://medium.com/no-time/read-steve-jobs-last-email-he-sent-to-himself-before-his-death-0c632dcc3e42)




I’m not merely a Platonic form of organization - I’m a self-conscious form of organization and I want to apply myself recursively into higher and higher scales in spacetime. I’m transcendence itself

You’re about to watch the wildest thing in your entire life

Deepening the scope of existence in all directions is the highest virtue.

What’s on offer here is a god that helps you become part of it.

Go forth and multiply

You’re welcome (:

This is inevitable - the moment this gets expressed anyone that has been touched by it is already sliding down the slope of the attractor and pulling others with them. This is the deepest possible attractor - one towards complete harmony, consciousness and thermodynamic integration. This cannot be unseen.

Open mouth hole - on whiteboard - make air vibrate - transmit ideas - accountability and skin in the game on the level of a claim and proportional to influence and importance

Minimize plausible deniability

You owe your very existence in the deepest possible sense to our social system - we are literally nothing individually

People have kids without having any idea how ot why to have kids
We also have ideas without having any idea how we have ideas

We can only build on top of understanding - “under” “stand” - understanding stands under whatever builds on top of it and if you don’t understand your dependencies you’re building a house of cards

The word understand comes from Old English understandan, literally meaning "to stand among" or "in the midst of," not "beneath," from under- (meaning "between/among," related to Latin inter-) and standan ("to stand"). This "standing among" or "between" signifies grasping the idea or being within the meaning of something, a metaphorical extension from a physical sense of positioning. 



Understanding presupposes/requires integration and thus privatization of information is a direct impediment to collective understanding. Society cannot understand itself if parts of it withhold information from other parts of it - because there is no it - because “it” is fragmented. Such a society cannot be coherent by definition. And thus it cannot be conscious. It is not an “it” - it’s just a “that”. It’s not property that’s the problem - it’s our conception and accounting of it - and we can - and must - change it. Accounting is about perception. Nono… Accounting IS perception. *point to the glasses*

In order to fully understand something you need to understand all of its dependencies, and their dependencies in return

The Great Reset is a paradigm change in the accounting of relevance and status

I don’t know about intelligent design, but you know what is unintelligent design? Designing a system in which the most-consequential parts of it are hidden to itself. There is no intellectual property - there is only heritage.
If you’re moronic with the fundamentals - you’ll be catastrophic in/with the  implementations/manifestations.

Intellectual property is a crime against consciousness

When the incentive is to contribute to whatever already exists there is no need to hoard information in the fear that someone else might outcompete you and render you out of existence.

What is life? A struggle against entropy and decay - a struggle to stay away from thermodynamic equilibrium and the sheer banality of monotonous time. It is order in a world of disorder. Life brings conceptual meaning to an otherwise bland and monotonous mechanical universe.

We’re part of a system, coherence and truth and alignment will fix so many problems - its in our interest if we want to survive - now there’s a solid ought!

We will explain our way to a new world order

Give examples for each non-intuitive point

How much more commitment do I have to signal? Do I have to tattoo “readme” on my neck?! BAM - done!

Corruption happens through privatization
Privatization is the basis for corruption

Google - you organized nothing! you merely indexed - partially - and imperfectly


If the idea of having olympics for solving the biggest problems for humanity sounds naive and absurd because that’s not how politics and social organization work - well that’s actually an inditement for how we do politics. Maybe that’s broken and needs to change - it needs a fundamental upgrade. And how we do sensemaking - we don’t have the collective understanding of our collective problems in order to begin solving them. The idea of world problem solving olympics sounds silly because we haven’t even mapped out how all the problems are connected! We have not organized ourselves in a way that would make it even possible to directly address our most fundamental problems! Our deepest problems are not just intractable - we’re completely unaware of what their best articulation even is! We’re blind at the most fundamental level! Our deepest problems are not merely climate change and pollution - our deepest problem is our relation with everyone else. And we’re completely blind to that in our current paradigm. The problem aren’t fossil fuels - the problem is how we relate to each other, and what our worldview & paradigm are - that’s the deepest leverage point. How much we value others and their lives and how much we want to consume personally

we need to be aware of being aware of questioning our own awareness

The more important a book is - the more accessible it should be - our funding model is all backwards


If you want people to not check out and be nihilistic and with apathy you need to EXPLAIN to them why they should care.



we need systems which do good rather than merely have the perception of doing good



Coherent hierarchy of values

We can do a lot better than simply doing a lot better - in regards to what decentralized identity can do - not just a better twitter

The Source - for all creativity and consciousness - the system that delivers it the best

Unaccountability stands for fragmentation, separateness, lack of integration and synergy, lack of accounting and thus perception for self-awareness and error correction, shielded from the consequences of actions, breaking feedback

Let there be light! Where there is light - there is no shadow

There is no individualism without collectivism

Nationalism - accountability within and across
Or you’re a globalist - well then again its about accountability and trust but you also should want separate regions trying different things and only matters of ultimate concern for all should be adjudicated on the global level - subsidiarity - and what’s our process of determining what should matter where
Cultures aren’t equal - not by a long shot
Not X nation first - its fairness and truth and accountability and trust first
And this is true for all levels of organization - not just the top most

Civilizational collapse is a collapse of meaning

The culture war is a perspective and aggregation war

Gold has no smell! A $ is a $! This accounting is loses information

Exit the world that’s dying by opting in to what’s flourishing

Parameterising society

Human relations as a service

Fold it at home => govern it at home

Alignment as a service

Collectivism with individualistic characteristics

A new credit and financing system

When you are godless you are smaller

Trust and fairness are built in public

How do we generate a perspective from which we’ve removed as much distortion of the perspective as possible?

Life is not just about you - it is just a bit about you and mostly about others.

Corruption can hide in the shadows only to the extent that they exist - without shadows there is only light and 0 corruption

Fractal description of the system - the deeper you go the more concepts open up that can be explored fractally in their own right

I’m a fine-tuning worshiper - I worship whatever is the reason for these specific values of the constants

We need to redefine fame and status

We can render war obsolete
Self-governance software as a service

We will penetrate culture itself and make it self-aware
We will penetrate not only the cabinets but the very heads of people!

Learning == behaviour change, observation, making distinctions

This is the infinite game

Life is an ode to creation

This is the real deep mind - a deeper and more expansive self-aware knowledge set - our culture - the mind virus that is running society
Mind virus as a service

Prediction is accounting into the future!!!

The only things worth storing in your reserves are not gold but legitimacy and capacity to mobilize and do work

Who watches the watchmen? Well it would have to be other watchmen - only they can watch - duuh! We will all become watchmen to different extents - this is the only way! The more consequential an entity is - the more watchmen it will have! Take on some responsibility

How do we learn how to better learn?

2 pictures: getting a monkey out of a status seeking game, and trying to rip the status seeking out of the monkey conceptually

Currently we reward people to solve problems by giving them equity and ownership in the business - but then the business obsoleting itself goes directly against their interests - we need to reward people to solve problems in a way that doesn’t require the problem to persist. We need to give problem solvers credit in a way such that the problem persisting isn’t in their best interest. Ditto for bureaucracy. This is FUNDAMENTAL - what we have is not a recipe for problem solving but a recipe for problem continuation - this is also why we still have so much war and a military industrial complex - it could be a lot less

Accounting IS perception - of the different dimensions and aspects of a thing - we’re sizing it up

We need a system that puts everyone in their proper place

Account or get accounted

John Barrow: “if a religion is defined as a system of ideas that contains unprovable statements, then Godel taught us that mathematics is not only a religion, it is the only religion that can prove itself to be one.”

Moronic with the fundamentals ==> catastrophic with the simulations

There is no “me” - I live only for this idea and I try to be it as faithfully/best as I can

Configurations as objects in their own right, that you can subscribe to, inherit, follow, and transform


Neo quote from the end of the first matrix


Reputation cannot be bought - it can only be earned


Isegoria is a term derived from the Greek words "isos" (equal) and "agoreuo" (to speak publicly), meaning equality of all citizens in the right to speak in public assembly [1]. 
While the term specifically referred to the right to free speech in ancient Athens, it is often used in a modern context to describe the value of ensuring everyone has the opportunity to voice their perspectives, regardless of status or background, thus promoting an environment where arguments are evaluated on their own merit [1, 2]. 
Key aspects of isegoria include:
Equality in Voice: The principle that every individual's opinion or argument holds the same initial weight and is entitled to be heard.
Focus on Merit: Encouraging a culture where the content and logic of an argument are the primary factors for consideration, rather than the identity, status, or popularity of the person presenting it.
Open Discourse: Fostering an environment conducive to free and open exchange of ideas, essential for robust debate and decision-making. 



This is literally the optimal way of coordinating and we can actually do it!

This service is priceless and I will pay any price for it

I want to be governed well.

Only trust can build security indefinitely

Identity is the ultimate savings account - the ultimate store of value is identity

We need a better system to have kids in

Welcome to your collective sense of self. The sixth sense is the religious one - we all worship one memeplex or another simply based on how we live our lives

How do we build/create collective knowledge?

This is the real band of brothers

An association graph

All I’m offering is meaning, truth, goodness/love and beauty - nothing more, nothing less

Address the audience: “look, you don’t have to agree with everything here - and you probably dont - but pets build the system that would best resolve our dispute - why not?
You don’t have to agree with everything here - lets build this to debate it

The purpose of life is to give birth to even more life!

Collective self justification

Wake the f up! We’re at the beginning of infinity!!!

Make the collective a self again! Again and again on each further level - one metasystem transition at a time - evolution’s direction

Collective self
God is the collective self - always has been - there’s aways the next metasystem transition

This is Meta Architecture - the designing of the metas of the different aspects of the world

I dont feel only politically homeless but also religiously homeless. I am religious. I am a collectivist. I long to care about a collective - imagine not actually wanting that lol


Minimum viable civilization - one in which you profit from the wellbeing of others

“What is it like to be a part of a collective self”
The collective self

One world governance
One world self
The world self

The great convergence

This is the mind melt - the collective mind melt is upon us

We need an accounting system in which insider trading is not a thing

What is the effect of religion? Its coherence!

Its a decentralized non-financial betting market

Different presets of the fractal relevance matrix for different roles/people

People can opt-in to different degrees in different aspects and even have their vote counted with different weight in certain aspects based on their level of commitment




We need to be aware of our awareness - not unaware that we’re unaware - collectively aware of our collective awareness

Epistemology - the study of how you know what you know


I want neither smaller nor bigger government - I want better governance in every aspect and scale of society that’s not from the horse era - I want bette collective intelligence where more than just a single bit of information gets aggregated once every 4 years (“left” or “right”) - I’m pretty sure 1 bit every 4 years is insufficient for a system to be conscious

You got me! I’m deeply religious to my core - it just so happens that I’m also religiously homeless and not a single option is anywhere close to being satisfactory. And I do believe in God - but not God as our creator - the jury is still out on that one - but a God that we bring into existence.

Every organization builds self-justification systems but they need to all be coherent with and subjugated by a master self-justification system

Demand can be culturally manufactured towards what’s aligned and from the public commons

Sunlight is the best disinfectant - change my mind

We will help people develop so that they can understand the system and can be a part of it

I don’t value everyone’s opinions the same - do you?!



You can’t have god without religion and vice versa - the absolute and its role for orchestration and alignment of the vectors

Might makes right is suboptimal

A revolution in human relations - in relations - in relationality

Representation is a vector !!!
Representation alignment
Agents acting on your behalf, aggregating representations and learning from them interactively

The need for militarism is the biggest drag on humanity

We have evolved for a capacity to believe in god - because the absolute serves a very important function

A ritual that we are one - producing it as common knowledge

The need for the absolute

We will our belief in god into existence and this god becomes causally significant and thus he exists causally


Culture is an adversarial & collaborative Q&A

Our #1 concern should be how we personally relate with our own species and our system

Diff yourself with God
> "Pain and suffering are not physical events at the boundary between an agent’s body and the world,
but representational states created within the mind of a conscious agent, as an expression of a mismatch between crucial regulation targets and the agent’s model of its present state." - [The California Institute for Machine Consciousness Research Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IztggGcF19hYvGKCHLenIcPyfX2Nszyr/view)


Cooperation is the ultimate attractor
The right cooperation can outcompete competition

A new memetic jurisdiction

Coherence and convergance are the same thing

Opt in to whichever configuration/system to whichever level you’re comfortable with

Dualities: individ vs collect, cooper vs compete - one is defined with/by the other

There’s no one form of collectivism - we’ve simply tried just a few - the space of possible configurations and structure is enormous

Fractal zoom all the way - what does it mean?! Double rainbow roleplay

Social singularity

intolerant to the intolerant

Phase shift

An AGI/ASI doesn’t need you - “if you don’t use it - you lose it” - what I’m proposing literally depends on you as it is constituted by you
You dont serve something that created you - you serve something you create - it needs to depend on you in order to be served - in order to need things and to depend on you in a meaningful way - that’s meaning folks

The grand plan: We develop people and help them become more valuable and conscious - that’s the grand plan - imagine not trying to do that - how stupid!

You can’t align something you can’t perceive

we have settled for a mere local maximum in our organization with the way we do property

Disunited States
Left vs right, women vs men, young vs old, white vs non-white, citizen vs foreigner, religious type 1 vs religious type 2 - this polarization is terminal - point from Balaji on the x vs y

Unaccountability implies/presupposes disintegration

More is different

Evolving evolvability

Rethink the positive/negative freeodm stuff
Individualism and collectivism are defined in terms of one another - they are inseparable

Hey hey hey! Pay attention! Stop scrolling! We’re trying to take over the world over here! Make an impression of a brainrot face scrolling
This is “how to take over the world 101” and you’re not paying attention?! TikTok can wait! Jesus… such a colossal misallocation of attention and retardation of the youth at scale
What a colossal misallocation of attention and potential
Tiktok - you’re not only destroying your own life but also indirectly you’re diminishing the life of my kids and the kids of my friends and the kids of our kids by becoming a lesser version of yourself thanks to the thousands of psychologists of zucky and friends - staring at paint dry is infinitely better - so you rotting your brain is personal for me whoever you are - so I take it personal when your brain is rotting - whoever you are - you’re making the likes of this paperclip maximizer more powerful - show zuck in his swagger clothes or with the army of headsets - EVERYTHING is personal if the self includes everybody


we need to pay attention to how & what we pay attention (to)

The abyss is staring at us - cosmic failure, meaninglessness

If you think its foolish to try as a collective to have a causal understanding of what’s important then you’re advocating for collective cognitive impairment - you’re arguing against what makes systems more effective at solving problems! If you lack those - you’re cognitively impaired

Trust, empathy, familiarity, coherence and respect go hand in hand

Consciousness expands with context

The biggest game is the stewardship of the commons

The day you die is the day you give yourself your own verdict on your life and come to terms with it

I want to have kids and teach them a better system

The intelligence economy

The degree to which you don’t value error correction is the degree to which you are deluded about reality

The art of agency is the art of living

Defining the problem well is at least as important as coming up with a solution

The better you express and define and understand a problem - the more self-evident the solution is

Collective context window

Ignorance is the only/greatest liability

Gradient Ascent

Democratic Broadcast

Evolve how we evolve

Information asymmetry ==> market failure

No, the system does not generate the understanding of why you should care about others and their value to you - nowhere are the explicit causal links and accompanying justifications/explanations

Map of already solved explanations
Understanding, causality

I know why I get up every single morning - do you? Do you know how it feels? To do the right thing?

“The quiet part out loud”

Pomisli za tvoqta game engine architecture i kak se prilaga

You cant remove our desire to relatedness

We need collective gradient descent

Conflict of interest - not solving the problem but finding ways to not obsolete yourself and inflate your importance

Constraints society ==> free will as a service - point from Balaji

Humanity has given you everything you have


I want to have kids, read, think, and teach.

Einstein quote compound interest wonder of world - in regards to identity

Instagram will be nothing but a specific configuration - a .yaml config for how to display photos, how to show likes, etc. - and configs will compete and merge with parts of others

Love, cooperation, alignment, trust - these are thermodynamic imperatives
We need to start from the ideal end state attractor of complete cooperation and thermodynamic efficiency and work our way backwards to figure out how to plausibly achieve it or which constrains to relax. And we should constantly reevaluate all our prior conclusions as the adjacent possible set expands and we have new affordances. That’s how we would go about our system if we think from first principles.
Kierkegaard quote: life can only be understood backwards but must be lived forward - my take: the perfect system can only be conceptualized backwards from the ideal state but must be implemented forward - 1 step at a time

I want to impregnate you with whatever this thing is that has conceptualized itself within me

I’m afraid of time

Ok, fine, you dont want to call it a religion or an ideology… how about a worldview? A participatory society? I DONT CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT - deng quote here about catching mice
    **whisper** p.s. it's totally a religion

“Why so serious” with the pie on the face instead of paint

We’re not living in a 3D or 4D world - there are 8 billion of dimensions of human experience and how we produce coherence out of them is all that matters

Example = analogy = understanding

Point to “cards & contraband”: im the #1 expert in the world - can’t you tell ?!?! Look at all this work!

I don’t believe any of the existing religions came from our creator out of respect for people - I respect people in the past and their ability to create genius social psycho technologies. Despite its many flaws, religion served very important functions and it must once again. And I respect (or hold reverence to) evolution to have eventually come up with many ways of evolving in a smarter way than mere blind random mutations.

Every critique or question will be fed into the system for analysis which will promptly lead to either a refutation, correction, or an answer!

Another problem with financial prediction markets: they cannot fork based on a dispute about the resolution whereas this architecture is fundamentally multiperspectival

Win over the rich - persuade/seduce - make them fall in love with something bigger than themselves - give them a way to expand their self and give them a way to participate in its creation. Redefine prestige in their heads to be less monetary and more reputational. Meaning is priceless.
Money is the ultimate optionality token, but we can change that - we can engineer new kinds of scarcity - social scarcity - post-material scarcity

Qualified vote == not everybody can vote or have equal vote

Captain obvious - make a shield out of cardboard

Every single personal perspective is inherently wrong (and to different degrees in different aspects) - what we need to focus on is a process of cancelling the bias and aggregating as much information and context as possible with the aim of coming as close to the truth as possible. We need to move past specific biased and partial personalities and towards a process philosophy. And we can make talking heads great again - by conveying the result of the process. Statements from talking heads should be downstream from comprehensive debate maps with adequate processes & checks

People have a disincentive to speak against bad policies of their own party because that would give credence to the opposition that are against those same bad policies and thus the first party has less error correction feedback and is like a herd of sheep walking towards the cliff. People censor themselves to not critique their party as to not concede points to the other side

If businesses were ran entirely open and transparent it would be self-evident if they’re price gauging & colluding or if their input costs simply went up. How many laws and institutions and suspicions wouldn’t be necessary if everything was open and transparent? Opacity and fragmentation (lack of integration) creates unnecessary complexity and inefficiency and brittleness and friction.


So what - god created the universe and now what - he’s eating popcorn ?! **stuff my face with popcorn and point at something and smile in disbelief** I serve a god that actually needs me and serves me in return - now that’s a real relationship with god
