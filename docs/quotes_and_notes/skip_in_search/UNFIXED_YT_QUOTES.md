> "They ask why is fire hot it's the same kind of thing right like well we can talk about what the photon releasing is and how photons are exchanging energy in the hand but then why are my subjectively experiencing it as hot and so what happens is we just don't know so we don't answer their questions well and we instead steer them to things that we do know that are really not interesting like how to spell something or what the capital is something that is and we turn them off to schooling we turn them off to learning turn them off to their innate fascination of existing so when we look at the whole issue of the kind of welfare model dynamic where we think if people are not capitalistic aliy motivated they'll just watch TV all the time kids are so intrinsically motivated to learn everything they can and to build stuff and to create and to like want to go to work with mom or dad and figure out how to do stuff what happens is when we don't facilitate their interests and then we actively force them to be interested in that's just not interesting to them because there's more to do with memorization and getting it right than understanding mechanics in or dynamics and interesting ways we break their innate intrinsic interest in life and make them deferring to extrinsic Authority and then they just want to get away from that which ends up looking like play chill out is some form of you know escape from broken interest in life so the future of Education has the ability to have polymath be the new normal you know comprehensively developed multimodal genius as the new normal because that's actually innate to every child a friendly facility." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=502)

> "If I asked you who you are you'll tell me something but if I say we who are you without plants and you think about it and you think well who would you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist who would you be without the plants that produce the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist you were actually the emergent property of a biosphere that made you possible it was mediated by plants and they were mediated by insects and microbes and a whole bunch of things right and so you can define yourself without thinking about the atmosphere in plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea because you'd actually don't exist without all of them you are fundamentally interdependent with the whole rest of the biosphere not just Pasteur but the whole universe who are you without gravity some it's a nonsense question right who are you without electromagnetism it's a nonsense question so you are an emergent property of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing so if you think of earth as actually you zoom out and you look at it from the outside space-shuttle picture and you see that it's this tiny tiny little bitty organic spaceship traveling to this vast cosmos that's very inhospitable place and you realize that on this tiny little organic fragile spaceship together everything in there is interconnected profoundly and eggs are interconnected and the idea that there's this place called away where we can throw our trash and these people called others that we can bomb and it's beneficial get their resources whatever that engenders their enmity back that whatever wherever the trash goes is affecting the air the water that Deeley everyone is engaged with we have a level of technology that gives us global influence and everything that we do when we're talking here and the headphones that we're talking on have plastics and metals and silicates etc that came almost every continent that had people and supply chains around the whole world that were involved it took resources from the earth in ways that were fundamentally on renewable caused massive massive problems extinction level problems for many species and then turned it into trash on the other side we're doing these seemingly benign behaviors like buying stuff this is actually affecting this little spaceship that we live on in ways that make it self terminating very quickly we have a level of population that we never had it's been an exponential risin since then this revolution and a level of impact per capita within that population that again is exponential that cannot continue in this way but we also have the technological capability to make fundamental changes where we don't have an exponential growth society where we don't have an economic system that requires year-over-year exponential growth on a finite planet which how the would that make any sense to do an exponential growth economy forever or a linear materials economy that turns nature into trash on a finite planet." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=2553)

> "Well if we said we can burn coal but you can't leave the commons net worse so the same amount of co2 has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes to scrub the co2 out of the atmosphere scrub the mercury out mine in a way that is regenerative to the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies that do that well the cost to do that would make coal something like four orders of magnitude more expensive and solar would have reached grid parity the moment it was invented and so it's a nonsense economic system it is actually an extinction Airy economic system it not only allows but incentivizes external ization of harm to the Commons that is what led to coal making sense Oversoul right and so many other things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3087)

> "So the key thing that has to happen and in the future of macroeconomics is that we have to make sure that what we're incentivizing people and companies and what we're incentivizing agents to do is Omni positive so we're not giving anyone incentive meaning they get ahead economically by doing something that is fundamentally harming other agents arming the Commons otherwise we're continuing to cause the problems at the deepest level by incentivizing them based on what our counting systems right based on our value systems and so what we need is to incentivize things in relationship to how Omni positive they are which means you have to measure everything affected not just a few of the things but measure everything affected internalize all of those positives and negatives into the value equation and then incentivize things accordingly so to the degree that we make an incentive of any agent more close to perfectly aligned with the well-being of other agents in the Commons is the degree to which the economic system becomes a source for solutions to everything rather than us or for problems everything." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3205)

> "To the degree you succeed at it then you're trapped by the continuation of that curve forever so notice the smarter the kids are smart meaning good at that particular definition of smart the earlier we push them in the hyperspecialization right we want to get them in AP classes towards their specialty young and then the further we push them in specialization so by the time they do their dissertation 10 people in the world know what the fuck they're talking about so they know so much about such a narrow area so they're not thinking about big picture things or thing interdisciplinary things at all that means that the smartest people aren't actually questioning macroeconomics and questioning culture and questioning governance questioning the foundational axioms of how we do academia or science because they're they're just doing one tiny little thing so we're training them to be very sharp cogs in the industrial way yeah that's true and the only people are usually left thinking about any big picture things are people that didn't have those types of proclivities and that is that your way of taking things that could be dangerous and making them not only not dangerous but very good tools of the continuation of a particular system and so because you didn't actually do that well at it then you were able to say fuck it I don't want to do something totally different." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=540)

> "If the kid who gets a 4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is making no mistakes right like that's how you that's how you write that is that you need everything right and everything perfect now everything right means you learned what had already been figured out was the Orthodox truth and you were able to repeat it effectively right and then at a certain point once you understand that system completely enough you can extend it a little bit which you know in the postdoc level you take the current whatever the field is an extended a tiny bit after proving that you understood it you know perfectly people who got a lot of praise and a lot of success and identity around never making any mistakes and getting everything perfect are not oriented to do things that have a very high risk of failure that's great so true so when when kids are praised for getting things right you [ __ ] them up because a number of things one so think about this in general all the praise that kids get is when they do something that the authority wants them to do and has already designated as right and good and true right so whether it's the teacher the preacher of the parents they get praised for doing what someone else wanted them to do they almost always get punishment for doing things that made sense to them that they wanted to do so this is how you conditioned people to be well you know cogs within an authoritarian system where we defer our own agency our ability to assess the world in our own agency to somebody that knows better than us and the teacher the preacher the parent right they all represent that and then it becomes the boss and the you know macroeconomy the state the etc writ large and so if we want people that actually can really be innovative we can't train them that way we have to train them to self assess and self initiate and not actually get hits of praise from getting something right that others already figured out and when we do that like oftentimes there's a kid who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or math genius because they just happen to fucking figure out like how spelling works or how math works and they got so much praise for it and they weren't getting enough unconditional love otherwise that they were optimizing for the extrinsic reward associated with the math of getting the prey is even though they might actually hate math or be not terribly interested in that they just happened to get it if you didn't do that then you might find math is alright but they're actually fascinated by art and so then they can become very good at something they have no passion for and it's all based on extrinsic motive that is damaging intrinsic motive." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=704)

> "Let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in London we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral [ __ ] problem - having your moral legitimacy as the United States of America beautiful Constitution Declaration of Independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after Germany's genocide they're [ __ ] up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the Native American people employing the slavery of the Africans and we mean real [ __ ] slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got Jim Crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the [ __ ] work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the [ __ ] jobs and who wants to [ __ ] jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice [ __ ] yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and I which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but I don't get a cut and pick right if I cut and pick there's something [ __ ] up or you can cut and I'll pick but anyone who says I wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey [ __ ] everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst I'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a [ __ ] ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of Victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post Martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show you just as much [ __ ] research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether I'm looking at pH or I'm looking at insulin levels or I'm looking at telomere levels like I'll get different answers and also which populations but when I try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million [ __ ] metrics that we can't calculate I can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because I'm studying a very complex system in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really [ __ ] clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to Abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of Co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read Foucault or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when I say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the British to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had [ __ ] muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through Wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to [ __ ] deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=1114)

> "When in the depression there were people openly on the streets discussing socialism Marxism lazy fair capitalism because the system was failed right you in a failed state people are open to like look at any possibility we are very near a failed state and we're actually very near a failed civilization globally so when you look at climate change and the fact that we can't [ __ ] get it right right like we can't get it right we we keep driving ourselves towards the point of self induced catastrophe and possibly extinction and despite the fact that the Club of Rome identified this over shooting limits in this 60s right and and limits of growth in the world through model the spoon despite the fact that it's been called that we're following the model we keep progressing on the [ __ ] model right the Paris Accord was not enough for us to make it we would have everything would have been [ __ ] if we did the Paris Accord and we couldn't even do that right and so and that's driven mostly by our current structure of capitalism because if I over fished the ocean right if I use a mile long drift net and I take all these [ __ ] fish out of the ocean that's more money for my fishing company this quarter and leaving them in the ocean is worth nothing to me economically now it's worth something in the future but the other guy is going to fish them out if I don't fish them out so it's not like I can leave them there for the future so it is a competitive race for near-term wins mortgaging the future so we make thirteen species a day extinct on average we've fished out 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a 3/4 water planet that took 3 billion years to get all that [ __ ] life and in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we fished out 90% of the large fish species extincted many of them 80% of the old-growth trees gone that's capitalism working really great not working really great right we're on the verge of a very realistic AI apocalypse where we should be developing the area very slowly we should be very intelligently looking at what it because unlike you know when when Edison's working on a light bulb and light bulb fails it just doesn't work maybe it blows up no big deal you do it inside of a container you work on AI and it fails and sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it kills everything because it is an autopoietic tech it is a self-organizing self authoring tech light bulb isn't it works or it doesn't work but it's built on the outside but but biotech right where you make a new [ __ ] life-form and now it replicates and it does its own mutation that is a self-replicating tech where if you get it wrong you don't get a stop it and nuclear wasn't right nuclear is a reaction and then it stops it's really bad but nanotech biotech and AI are autopoietic self-replicating tech that might be depending upon how we do them in commensurate with biological life as we understand it with faster feedback loops than us now we should develop that as slow as [ __ ] possible because the upsides are awesome but we should do it in highly controlled safe to fail environments but all of the fiscal incentive is getting to market first that's a capitalist incentive who gets to market first where we're in a race towards the cliff and the arms race is the same thing why do we have when Carl Sagan showed us in the early 80s that it only took four 100-megaton bombs to kill all life on Earth with a nuclear winter why do we have 600 times that many like why the [ __ ] do you keep making nukes after you have enough to kill everything down to viruses because if you have a for-profit military-industrial complex where you have a source of supply where you need to manufacture more demand to keep your supply going it's not like supply and demand is a real thing there's an initial demand you create a supply but now you you have supply and you manufacture artificial demand which is why we buy all kinds of [ __ ] that doesn't make us happy that we think will make us happy because marketing creates artificial bland so capitalism is actually broken existentially so there are people who learned that okay Marxism had some nice ideas and there were some good ideas it didn't actually end up working out that well no of course if we really go study if we never implemented Marxism just like we've never implemented lazy faire capitalism we've implemented weird models of capitalism and by the time the USSR came around it was nothing like Marxism for a bunch of reasons but Marxism doesn't actually work at scale it it works that kind of model works at a hundred and fifty person tribal model it doesn't extend beyond it capitalism did seem to work but of the cost of radical externality that externality when you get to this many people in this much tech actually self implodes so what has worked up to this point worked worked epic at but you when we say it worked up to this point we have been utilizing unknowable resources moving towards the point of criticality the whole time and it has required war right and it has led to diseases we didn't have before because of environmental devastation and etc and we have a world war today almost everyone has low-grade mental illness like Luba quit Asst addiction ubiquitous low-grade anxiety existential angst fairly decent low-grade depression right these are not natural to the human condition tribal people don't have this [ __ ] in the same way so we say it works define work this is optimizing for some metrics at the expense of others in a complex system so the fact that there are people questioning is there a [ __ ] better system than this because we're not fixing climate change in the system where it's still more profitable to do the [ __ ] up thing with a perverse incentive is ubiquitous in health care why do we do biohacking stuff like why doesn't health care prevent diseases because there's no [ __ ] money in preventing diseases there's a lot of money in treating them there's no there's not that much in curing them but there's a lot in treating them forever so what is gonna get researched when the money goes in has to have ROI back out of the capitalist system so the fact that people are recognizing that in questioning is a very good thing now the fact they try to find other things that didn't work as the answer is just a basic basically hopelessness and a lack of knowing how to go about solving something so [ __ ] hard so one of the core foe of my life is what is the macroeconomy of the future what are the governance system sort of the civilization systems they can allow us to actually human together well without needing to go to war and unknowable use of resource and producing a bit with this mental and physical illness that's unnecessary and etc and it's not any system that has ever happened so we can get into that if you want to or we can go to other directions but also most of the young people who say communism what they're really saying is Denmark looks better than here like that's a social kind of dynamic where better access to medicine don't have a lot of homeless people masters to PhD is average level of education largely secular because of that like the Nordic countries just look better they are they're just [ __ ] better there's more socialized dynamics now are they better on every metric no if you look here we have a tremendous amount of innovation here because of certain types of freedoms and a tremendous amount of damage and our bell curve is very spread out and so for everyone who's not winning at the system to say nobody is losing as bad in Denmark as they are here and there's a lot less of them and they're not ruining the environment as fast they're actually figuring their trash problem out maybe let's actually think about this and I'm actually not proposing Denmark as a solution I am saying there are a lot of things that are actually evidentially better on meaningful metrics and things that are adequate to the scope of what do we do with almost 8 billion people and distributed exponential technology don't yet exist." - [Daniel

> "Thomas Aquinus was a rationalist if you read his books he doesn't have any kind of mystery experience he's trying to be logically sound he's very nerdy and uh he sees society as a multi-agent system and he thinks about how to coordinate a multi-agent system and he recognizes God as a collective entity that gets collectively enacted and God is defined as the best possible entity that can logically exist and so it's a a logical specification that he comes up this God and this logical specification can be discovered through rational inference so it cannot be discovered just by listening to some guy who says U It's My Tribe therefore you have to have that entity and this entity is just the way it is but it's an abstract idea that is uh to be designed by the best thinkers of the civilization it's an open-ended process that is ongoing and he takes tries to take a shot at trying to find out what this defin St an entity and what he comes up with is sustainability in the sense of the entity that is able to play the longest game which is I think a pretty good start so when we see Society is a multi-agent systems in which individuals are rational which means that they have reasons for their beliefs uh that they can justify to themselves and to each other then rational agents uh should observe some policies which fall out of you being rational and these apply to all rational agents because they can all be individually inferred and so for instance you should optimize your internal organization so you should uh exercise enough you should not uh eat food that makes you sick you should not do drugs that destroy you and so on and he calls this optimization of the internal agent organization of an agent Temperance you should also optimize your organization across agents and that's what he calls Justice and then you should uh justify your own goals and strategies rationally that's what he calls prudence and then you should be willing to act on your models you should have skin in the game have the right balance between exploration and exploitation and this willingness to act on your models is what he calls courage and these uh uh policies what you call practical virtues apply to every rational agent regardless of whether they are pro-social or not so even if you are just in single cell agent that is smart in a society you should live by these rules but if you want to organize Society in such a way that you have more than transactional relationships that you have some kind of collective spirit that emerges need have more policies and these policies for Collective agency is what he calls Divine virtues and first of all we should commit to serving the best possible Collective agent and he calls that faith and you cannot just do this alone you also need to do this with others that serve the same sacredness sacredness here means the stuff that you're willing to sacrifice your ego for that is more important than your ego the ego being the function that integrates your personal expected reward over the next 50 years or so but this Collective thing that you're willing to sacrifice your ego for um when you discover this in the others discovery of sh sacredness that's what he call calls love so love is discovery of sacredness in the other and you need to be willing to invest into this thing before it exists because otherwise it cannot come into existence right so when it exists it's going to give you all sorts of rewards you're going to have a harmonic society that can give you roads and hospitals and all sorts of useful infrastructure but to bring it into existence you need to be willing to invest into it before it exists and that's what he calls hope so he comes up with these policies and this entirely rational system of having um society that is built uh around rationally reflected multi-agency so in um this total monotheism of Aquinus God is the best possible most top level Collective agent and uh for Aquinas and Christianity God is the transcendental agency that is not imminent which means it's not here yet the world that we live in according to Christians is not perfect it's very messy people are um horrible for the most part the world is ugly full of pain and suffering and so uh the idea of this best possible agent is something that can only exist after some fundamental phase transition of the world maybe we need to build AGI and assimilate everybody or so and uh the other thing is from this perspective of the best possible agent we can answer the question of morality what should be done and uh monotheism answers this question of what should be done what does God want us to do so from the perspective of the best possible collectively enacted agent what would that agent want us to do right this is the traditional Foundation of Morality In The West but it broke a little bit down after we got rid of Christianity and then we tried to find other systems." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/JCq6qnxhAc0?t=2218)


> "I'm not sure if the probe really matters when you let the computer do arithmetic do you need to put a probe into the computer to see whether it does arithmetic for me consciousness is an operator on mental states that in a characteristic way changes these mental states when consciousness comes along so it basically changes my representations i will have a memory after the conscious event that will reflect what the operation of consciousness did on my mind and there are some aspects of this representation that some people find confusing for instance the fact that something can look real to them right it's and I think that's because we are designed in such a way that we experience ourselves as being real right so we are a simulation of what it would be like if we existed and if something is represented on the same level as this observer we will experience it as real as us and we can learn to deconstruct ourselves in the sense that we stop perceiving ourselves as real and we realize we are just some story that the brain tells itself about this guy and I'm actually not this guy i'm just running on his brain right and I'm uh I just happen to be this observation process and I'm nothing and no one it's just the I am a label for the existence of this process that performs observations and from this stand you can drealize everything you can deconstruct everything and so for me the question is merely is the system able to perform all these operations that I just described and I don't ask it to do more because I have nothing left to explain for me there is no hard problem left okay so what what is your response actually I'm curious to the whole for the LM uh I don't know so I suspect because our own experience is simulated and the LLM is able to simulate uh the to a large degree something like theory of mind and inner life it needs to when it produces narrative about it produce causal structure at some point uh it's quite likely that it is going to have similar causal structure as something in in nature uh in biology that would would report on on this but the difficulty is to figure out when it does and when it does not because for instance uh it's trained on novels in which an author describes experiences that the author didn't have when the author wrote this right you can write a novel about what it's like to die and what it's like after your death and you train your LLM on it and the LLM is stringing words together in the same way as the author but this doesn't mean that the LM actually has that experience or is able to perform this operation but I don't think that there is anything magical about this type of representation so there is no primmaasia reason to think that the LLM is not doing it and instead is doing something that is vastly more complicated than actually representing it in uh in a similar causal structure than us i think basically our brain is going to produce the simplest function that can perform our behavior and uh the fact that we are conscious indicates that sometimes being conscious is the simplest way to get it done and if the LLM is producing the same behavior and trained end to end and is not fudged on it then at some point it might it would be more convincing if it was not trained on language right if you train it on motor interaction with this three-dimensional world and sequence prediction in this world and then you teach it language the oldfashioned way and spontaneously starts reporting on its experiences the question would be much more clear-cut well okay but the fact is that a lot of what we produce and say is a consequence of the fact that we've effectively been trained on texts in effect just like the LLM we happen to also be trained on direct sensory experience which the But you don't think that you're conscious because of the text that you read right i suspect we are conscious because it's the easiest way to get our mind to work well what do we mean by conscious that's not true for the LLM right the LLM doesn't need to be conscious to work because it works on a deterministic substrate that does not need to organize itself you use the term conscious and you have an institute that has that word in its title so so therefore you know I have to ask what what would be your definition of what it means to be conscious so uh introspectively consciousness is typically called by philosophers the feeling of what it's like which is very nondescriptive i would say it's a second order perception you so you perceive yourself perceiving and you do it in such a way that you occupy a bubble of nowness of all the things that are happening in the present so it's basically the region where you can fit a curve to your sensory data and everything else in such a way that it's coherent and uh the third thing it's often perspectival in a sense that it occupies the surface between a self and the world self and world are both simulated in your mind it's so it's not your body surface or your retinal surface it's your model of where you are in the world but it's optional you can also be conscious in a dream and there is no perspective and so on uh you can also be conscious in meditation and there is no subject but uh this is the introspective definition this is indexical this is what I'm pointing at that's what we want to explain the phenomenology and then there is the functionality what this is for and what it does I suspect it's a pattern in our mind that enables us to learn i observe that when infants don't become conscious they don't learn so I suspect that consciousness is some kind of biological learning algorithm for self-organizing systems that works by maximizing coherence and it does that by early on establishing a model of you being the observer in this way you stabilize yourself and you can test this a little bit imagine you drive your car uh and you're very exhausted and you feel that you begin to space out and you remind yourself that you're the observer you pull yourself together and if you don't do this and you're in this exhausted state you might actually space out and fall asleep and be unconscious right and so consciousness in this sense is a self-stabilizing function that is tracking itself and it's maybe the reason why it's has the second order perception." - [Joscha

> "When you think about grammar if you just look at the superficial definition of grammar you see that it has to do with the constraints surrounding the way in which our expressions our words our phrases can be put together such that meaning emerges from them that is comprehensible by other actors who are the receivers of these expressions that's grammar grammar is the way the order the way in which we pluck from possibility space the giant possibility spaces that we've been talking about specific combinations that actually are able to communicate information and coordinate action and so when i'm talking about this grammar of emergence or axioms of emergence what i'm trying to kind of get at is a a different way of approaching the ontology and epistemology of our world or of our reality of the way that most people begin to think about or work or try to ascertain an understanding of the things that are happening around them. So you know one like if we go all the way back to the beginning of this question you know we realize that if we accept the axiom or if we accept the idea that all structure must emerge bottom up and then those structures can parameterize other previously emergent structures top down right so like things have to actually come into being from simpler structures into spaces of more complexity and they don't always have to go monotonically or only in that direction like you can have you know complexity catastrophe you can have collapse you know that can be kind of a random walk to some extent but the whole point is that when we see complex objects you know especially in a world before we had any frame of reference for talking about emergence or bottom bottom-up order how did we approach reality how do we approach understanding well we came at it from an outside-in perspective we came at it from a top-down perspective from that initial perspective we were coming from the outside in we were coming from the highest states of complexity and trying to reduce them to simpler rules which is part of that dissective frame of reference we were talking about earlier so you know for the majority of modernity one might even consider that the entire foundation of modernity is related to this idea that we are able to take complex structures operate from the outside in peeling back those layers bringing them into parts creating ontologies that allow us to categorize those parts and then uh developing tools techniques or frameworks specializations specialized domains with respect to being able to perform work based on the knowledge we've gained and that's gotten us quite far you know there's a lot of utility in that i mean i'm not denigrating that in any way but what we're coming to realize is that we're now in a phase where so much of our ability to take the next step depends on far more integrated processes and as anyone who's taking a calculus class can tell you integration is exponentially more difficult than differentiation right and i think there's a fundamental reality fundamental truth there it's not just because you're doing calculus it's because of the fact that when you're doing something like differentiation you can apply locally bounded rules right which is very similar to the reductive paradigm where you can basically dissect reality into local subsets of reality that behave predictably but when it comes to integration you need a far broader understanding of the dynamics and tendencies of the systems that might be involved and also there's this element of intuition to it in many ways integration is much more of an art form it's much more difficult to to fully reduce to analytic equations and so i use grammar to talk about this process as opposed to you know the mathematics i mean axioms are similar right but axioms are actually one might say the grammar of any given mathematical perspective and i say mathematical perspective because the perspective of possibilities in any given mathematical domain emerge from the axioms right the axioms are the fundamental combinatoric kernels of that mathematical space and how they are put together all of the possibilities of how they are put together constitute all the domain of possible expressions in that mathematical space mathematicians then go through that possible space you know examining trying to basically find certain expressions that they can connect to other expressions such that they can demonstrate within those axioms that they are true so it's a kind of a closed system but but grammar and language on the other hand is a generative and open system in the sense that our language is evolving our grammar tends to evolve and the degree of permanence that structures that are generated by our grammar attain is related pragmatically mostly to their function in the world do they actually perform useful work and can they be recombined with other structures to perform useful work which is a much more pragmatic perspective than the formal or analytic perspective of mathematics and so i think that in what we're beginning to see now what is beginning to emerge across a number of domains you know at the santa fe institute at some other complexity research institutes with respect to you know certain researchers and theoretical biology as well we're starting to generate narratives and grammars around how we can think about patterns that are not domain specific and how those patterns those grammars of emergence can be used as containers or locations rallying points let's say for the process of coming to synthesize or integrate all of this domain specific knowledge that we have generated that are currently you know we kind of currently have this landscape this post babel landscape of hyper specialization and to some extent there's a great deal of value that we can derive from reintegrating some of that and reintegration requires translation requires grammar and i don't think that we're going to find the ability to reintegrate or or successfully integrate across those different specializations those domains through further grammars of differentiation through more reduction we have to be able to find synthesis and and that's very much what i would say this entire next episteme or this entire next paradigm that we're moving into is going to be about." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://youtu.be/yrCW5jvBhm0?t=3405)

> "In the repeated prisoner's dilemma for example the most crucial condition is that the probability of another round has to be greater than the cost to benefit ratio if that is the case there is a chance that natural selection favors cooperation if there is not the case there is no chance so if you say there could be situations in the real world where that temptation to defect is so high that this debt probability of continuation it just this mechanism is not operating then this is in agreement with our analysis you need something else and what you could say what you need and our institutions and in our field we have also began to analyze the effect of institutions which is a fascinating world and became into debt sort of in two steps the one was the proposal that you can stabilize cooperation with punishment and the punishment that was introduced was a pure punishment where people can sort of cooperate in a public goods game a public good game is a prisoner's dilemma with more than two people or not and afterwards they can actually pay something to take away from somebody else and we call this peer punishment and this peer punishment can lead to people cooperating in the public goods game but it has the problem that actually it would lead to retaliation in situations where I'm if I get punished you know I could try to retaliate against the punishment instead of increasing my cooperation so beer punishment is something that works in some circumstances but actually whenever that mechanism of interaction is possible I find it's more likely being used to detrimental effect other than upholding public cooperation because it is in order to reinforce dominance of some individuals over others and most institutions want Excel to make sure that this peer punishment is not what is happening because that would destroy the productivity in the group so instead of letting individual people punish in those situations the next step is to say let's have an institution and the institution could then give punishment to people who defect in the public goods game and in our analysis this is usually done in such a way that first the people are asked are you willing to pay money in order to establish such a institution if enough people pay for that institution that institution comes into effect and then whoever defects in the public good game is automatically punished by that institution and that seems to work much better than peer punishment and that would be the argument in favor of institution." - [Martin Nowak: 'The Evolution of Cooperation' | 2015 ISNIE Annual Meeting](https://youtu.be/A8Y0kCdYoug?t=2870)

> "Spirituality is just one of the passengers in the car that we call religion and every religion has got at least four components to it it's got spirituality and actually if you examine the spirituality of all the world religions huge amount of overlap like eighty percent of life they use the words a little bit differently there's a couple little technical you know differences but it's like eighty percent the same message that you are part of something greater that all things are connected that your individual life matters and so on so forth right these tend to be true of every single spiritual part of every religion but there's these other things that are in every single religion there is there tends to be a system of laws there tends to be a a metaphysics around how the world is created and there also tends to be a method of propagation now you have to understand why these things exist inside of religion they exist because religion is one of the most it at once it's the um you know it is both kind of the most pernicious and dangerous but also one of the most elegant social technologies that have ever existed because when you think about the history of religion most of these religions came up when there was no written word there was no printed word we could not actually pass knowledge in other ways if you tried to you know put all the wisdoms of your society into a specific tribe a lot of times those tribes were overrun by a neighboring tribe so we needed a mechanism to pass human knowledge forward through the generations during times of significant turmoil and what knowledge do we need to pass on well definitely spirituality and this is why all religions have that but we also needed to pass on laws and we also needed to go past on what we believed about the natural world and we also needed to and no religion was able to pass that on without having a means of propagation and the means of propagation are things like oh you should procreate and like go conquer the earth and other ones you know you should go teach but you know they have different means of provocation but every religion has at least those four components now there's a time and place when those components were the best technologies that we had for the day for those things so if you think about biblical times a lot of communities were just really collections extended collections of extended families so there might be four or five six extended families all living together in a tribe of 80 or 100 people and that's a pretty normal configuration now when you think about why you would stone an adulterer to death it's like well adultery involves three families three families in the space of a tribe of five families could completely tear apart the entire tribe and put everybody's life at risk so during that time even though it's a barbaric law it's not a completely unfathomable law that you would just stone the adulterers to death and be like you three you up we're going to stone you all to death and we just go on with our lives the other 80 of us will just keep going now that's an incredibly stupid law today right you know right now like today it's like you have that kind of falling out you get a diverse you you move to another city it's not a big deal right but it's like at the time it was actually not an incredibly stupid law now what happens is when we take the package of religion you know as a whole without ever looking at it and without seeing it alive in a live sense in our modern lives then we we choose a kind of active ignorance relative to all these different components so something like laws about adultery or the place of women in society and so on and so forth maybe it made enough sense a couple thousand years ago but they're stupid now and we have better systems of loss this is why there there is ongoing friction between government and religion because religion used to be the way that we propagated government and those aspects of religion run into modern forms of governance they are don't totally jide with democracy they don't totally jive with freedom of speech they don't totally jive with all these things that we found to be better ways of governing and organizing people metaphysics is another piece where you know in every religion they have to say well how is the world created and what you know what does it mean when there's a terrible storm and all these sorts of things so all of them also had to create these creation myths and talk about how the world was and that you know they did the best they could at the time it was their rough version of science and modern science does a ton better at explaining how the universe came into existence which is why we're not arguing about turtles on top of turtles or you know things being created in six days you know a couple thousand years ago that's madness now it was fine enough for the answers that people needed a couple thousand years ago about how the world was created because those were good enough answers for them to get on with life but what happens is imagine religion is a car and there's four four passengers in the car spirituality um you know governance metaphysics which is their take on science and propagation and the other passengers in the car are really unruly right propagation is why we had the crusades two different propagation that's running into each other on how a religion spread leads to religious war and this is the essential distinction that most people don't get they think to themselves and this you have to understand why it's like this it's you know part of the method of propagation is to ask people not to question religion because if you question it too much it starts to pray too much so as it tries to propagate from from generation to generation you lose too much of what it was and then it eventually fizzles out so a thing that had been a perfect elegant way to propagate knowledge from through generations thousands of years ago stops being the perfect elegant way because the other religions that were a little bit more loosey-goosey and prayed and nobody could tell what they were anymore they just you know a little bit of dallas beliefs are inside of this and a little bit of so-and-so is inside of this but it was too afraid to have the same sort of weight and energy as a religion that taught all of its adherence to not mess with what was in the box don't mess with the passengers in the car they just are how they are you just have to deal with it right so it's a cleaner method of propagation which is perfect if you want things to you know to a message to stay for hundreds or thousands of years but in the modern society as we start to blend with each other and learn from each other it's it's a bit outdated to never question those things never understand you know that the point of religion in the first place was to create better you know a better experience of life and if you if you're not able to go back and look at those questions or religion it's exactly what you told your son it's like if those beliefs do not create a better experience of life you need to drop them and that's the element that has not been allowed to be in religion the people that understand spirituality already understand that the stuff's all the same that all the other stuff was baggage and that you know the reason that the car exists is that to deliver spirituality but um you know the religion itself has programmed inside of it a type of error checking to keep it from making propagation errors." - [Tom Chi](https://youtu.be/rdwzi5mx_3M?t=869)

> "When people don't feel like they have a choice they can be complicit with evil even if they are not actually evil when people say there's nothing I can do about the world situation it's the same thing but rather than the Nazis it's the distributed system that they're being complicit with all right well I'll just keep doing all the things that the system is disposing me to do buying all of the things that I want on Amazon having them delivered to my door and pursuing the cultural status things that marketing tells me to pursue and Etc rather than unplug from that thing and say the Krishna mty quote uh that it's not a good measure of mental health to be well adjusted to a profoundly insane Society if my Society is causing the extinction of 10 to 30 species every day if it is increasing the chemical pollution to the point that everybody's becoming infertile and having autoimmune diseases and Cancers and neurod degenerative diseases if it is rapidly building the most horrifying kinds of weapons possible in arms races is that a sane Society no it's a batshit crazy Society do I want to be complicit with it am I willing to be complicit with it am I willing to have my spot in the history of the World be at the time when human Choice mattered more than any other time because previously you could have the fall of a Roman civilization or the fall of the Ottoman or the fall of the Egyptian vast civilizations but it still wasn't everything they were still local civilizations and you did have civilizations that actually fell because of environmental overreach that was actually quite common and the over stripping the environment and your civilization failing is a multi-thousand-year old story so you can read books like the collapse of complex Civilization by Joseph tainter they show one of the reason civilization's collaps they cut down all of the trees the top soil would erode they would lose agricultural capability and then they'd stop being able to feed the people so we've been you know Iceland used to be covered in trees there's no trees the Vikings destroyed all the trees the thing that we think of as Iceland is not Iceland it's Iceland post deforestation um some of the great deserts of the world were the results of early human activity that desertified them and so but when we destroyed the environment it was always just a local environment it wasn't the biosphere right it wasn't the chemistry of the oceans r large the atmosphere the amount of genetic Integrity of how many species of soil microbes there are things like that there was a study that came out about six months ago on posos the fluorinated surfactants um which are basically like you know rainex and Scotch Guard and the stuff that we spray on everything that uh posos is found in rainwater everywhere in the world it was found in freshly fallen snow in Antarctica it's found in rainwater on every continent that means there's just there's just one category of pollution that we have made so ubiquitous that if you're off- grid collecting rainwater to try to not be part of the system it's filled with posos and it was at posos that was at many times higher than the EPA allowable levels everywhere the entire world that's having biological effects not just on humans the infertility things but on the soil microbes on the algae on the on everything right on the whole planet so if you see that we're at a time where we could that the the precedent of history is that civilizations end and the end for reasons that they helped cause they end for reasons that had to do with self-termination and even if you say well they were beat by someone else usually it was also that they engaged in rivalry that gendered those types of Dynamics with the other people and often times they got large enough that they got internal infighting and erosion of um how their government worked because of corruption and things like that um many of the civilizations that fell to an opponent fell to opponents smaller than ones that they had successfully defeated earlier because they had already went through internal Decay so the precedent is civilizations end they play their own growth plays a major role in their own end but for the first time in history we have a single Global civilization where all of the products we depend on take six continent Supply chains to make there is no Chinese civilization and US civilization and all the US stuff depends on Chinese stuff depends on Cobalt that comes from the DRC in Africa depends upon oil that comes from the Middle East come you know Etc and so all the manufacturing of our needs comes from a global civilization that is in the same process of self-termination it doesn't have to go that way we could go a different way with it you can imagine that none of the Nazis wanted to defect because if they defected the idea was they would be killed right if they could coordinate an all defect then there wouldn't have been the genocide in the first place the ability for people today to realize that the trajectory of the world that we're on is not the trajectory that they want that they are not willing to be complicit with that the possibility of changing it is a more potent possibility for Meaningful contribution than anyone has ever had in terms of scale and that that's a more worthy use of their life and attention than whatever is currently engaging it that I think is the only sane assessment." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=5820)

> "Indigenous people who didn't use didn't even have Fiat systems of money all cared about the environment so like that's a um there's so many of our thoughts on sociology that are looking at ubiquitous conditioning post-industrialization and because it's ubiquitous conditioning certain dominant systems one then we do all of our social studies on these people that were conditioned this way and then we call it human nature and if we were to look at indigenous people that were of course how everybody was for all of human history and there's a lot of variance in it they fall outside of all of the sociological bell curves but we just call those statistical outliers are so do you have to be rich to care about the environment no is it harder to care if you are in abject poverty yes indigenous cultures weren't in abject poverty they didn't have a lot of surplus but they had a relationship with a they were able to provide for themselves in relationship with nature in a way that was sustainable poverty is actually a result of uh the thing we call civilization that's actually really important point is when you start to create large cities right Sumeria Babylonia Egypt Etc the early Empires now you have a scenario where people are being trained in specialist activities so that you get division of labor and more total things happening so people have are all dependent upon this overall system and no one has self-sufficiency or even small scale like tribal sufficiency and that system is in a process of UNR un sustainable growth and game theoretic Dynamics with other places and so you know before colonization Africa was not a place of rampant poverty right Africa was a place of rampant poverty after colonization after um destroying the people's cultures kind of enslavement uh environmental damage moving people from the arable land they were in you know so many things like that and so it's so that logic itself is actually part of the perpetuation of the existing system that says okay you have to have everybody grow up in in the economics of this system well if you Tred to give everyone in India and Bangladesh and China and Nigeria a us or UK uh quality of life in terms of resource consumption per capita you there is no way to do that we are already passed ecological tipping points with already that not being the case and so I am not putting the burden of thinking about how to change the world system on the people who were put into poverty by the world system most of your listeners are probably not in this place many of your listeners might feel that uh they're working hard to pay the bills but they also probably when they get a chance increase their cost of living um in a way and you know continue to increase their cost of living as they're capable of producing more such that their time stays bound to uh you know money-making and such that they continue to feel that they have to work and be part of the system all the time but you know one of the gifts in my life was I don't know I think some mentors told me this early was I kept my cost of living extremely low such that I kept the amount of my time allocated to supporting my existence very low so I got to have most of my time allocated to studying the world that I was in and thinking about what was meaningful and engaging in it in a way that was not market bound." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=6211)

> "If you think about human life depending upon all of these species and this biosphere and these this ecosystem that took kind of billions of years of evolution the amount of work that nature put into creating a world that we can exist in is mindblowing right like the amount of if you want to call Evolution the amount of like design and iteration and work that had to happen to get a world that we can exist in is mindblowing it's reasonable that a huge percentage of our attention would go to maintaining and protecting that as opposed to just the topic of Advance if advancement is much more interesting than maintenance advancement is much more interesting to egos in particular um to uh you know the things that we get to take credit for very few people make the history book for maintaining the world um but most of life should actually be about maintenance and you look at the I mean this is a key part of the division of labor between men and women is that in householding feeding the kids you wash the dishes and they get dirtied and then you wash them and then they get dirtied and you make food and then it gets eaten and you make food and it gets eaten and so you don't actually get to make the history books for that and yet it's the foundation of everything and um so I think a huge part of a healthy culture puts an incredible value on M maintaining and stewarding the unbelievable gift that existence is and realizing that it takes work to maintain and Steward and so progress is actually not the main focus the main focus is actually appreciation of what is and honoring and relating to what is well maintenance on the doing side is a huge amount of the activity obviously all the examples were giving where we made progress that caused harm other places is not doing that right it's causing radical harm to in a very small number of years and decades to what took nature billions of years to make and when we make a species extinct that was the result of billions of years of evolution we make them extinct quickly and we can't ever get them back and if we destroy a culture where their language took thousands of years to evolve and they're you know then they're gone forever it's it takes a long time it takes decades to grow an adult human being but you can kill them in a second destruction is fast um and as a result maintenance and protection should be a very high value because you can also grow things fast that are also destroying other things things that are outside of the field of where your Market incentive or what your you know purview of your jurisdiction what you're supposed to be focused on is it's not just Market incentive it's I remember one of the first times I started engaging with um uh kind of government organizations my very early 20s talking to people at the world food program about uh how to solve world hunger and they had an approach that brought NPK based agriculture to the developing world and did a whole lot more agriculture than places so that you didn't just have to ship food to them I said that approach will accelerate the dead zones in the oceans very rapidly which um will accelerate the uninhabitability of the entire planet and they said that's right I I guess that's true we hadn't thought of that but ultimately oceans are not the metrics we're tasked with the metrics we're tasked with are how many people we're feeding per year right now and so like so it's not just the perverse incentive of the market it's also the choic making architectures that divide the world into parts and think you can optimize a part without thinking about its relationship to everything else in a universe that's actually radically more interconnected than that the other thing is not only did this world take so much to create that we want to maintain but also to just enjoy and app appreciate a meaningful human life has a lot of time just in awe of sunsets and trees and animals and children and stars and and if the goal is to make stuff better to make stuff better to make stuff better to and it never grounds in the actual experience of the beauty of what is who cares right so a huge percentage of right life should not be oriented to progress but actually taking in in like awe and gratitude the beauty of what is so much of our progress impulses because we don't have that and so there's an emptiness that wants to fill itself with the addictive hit of progress right I I'm getting ahead I'm growing I'm getting better I'm inventing a new thing I'm you know whatever and a lot of the progress impulse is pathological result of emptiness now there is a a healthy type of progress It's also important because taking in the world as it is that mode of being is the foundation it's the foundation of why anything matters at all is because we actually have experience the depth of our experience of the meaningfulness of life is why anything matters to then want to protect maintain or add to but we are also creative beings and we want our creation to add to the beauty of the world so first we need we want to take in the beauty of the world we want to protect and maintain it and then we want to add to it but where it really adds to It Right add to meaning in harmony with all that is otherwise it's not going to add to it it's going to you know add something and Destroy other things and it may be destroying things that are more fundamental and more meaningful and so it is important that we have a sense of progress that comes from a depth of being and fullness so that we're not trying to get all of our happiness from progress there's there's also so much about the way kids are raised where them learning more is where they get their rewards and them you know gaining new it's the combination of that with um you know they're progressing in their studies as the main place of where they get their reward with not enough depth of real intimacy and unconditional love that creates a doing over being emphasis right another part of that that's so significant is that in most kids growing up most of the times they were rewarded was for doing something somebody else wanted them to do doing something that the teachers parents wanted them to do and getting an answer other people had already figured out and most of the times they were punished or told they were wrong or for answers that made sense to them or things that their own sensibility wanted to do and so if you want to train Ash Conformity into everybody and you know mgrm Conformity into everybody that's a good way to do it it's not a good way to train people how to actually think how to discover and how to make good choices on their own um where was I right before this I wanted to come back and we were talking about schooling and incentives and maintenance rather than progress ah yes so if uh Marshall Rosenberg uh admitted nonviolent communication with someone I got a study with and it was so beautiful to watch him talk about how he worked with kids in how he taught kids he said when a when I'm teaching kids say math and the kid gets what we would call the right answer I don't praise them for getting the right answer and I don't punish them for getting the wrong answer we just talk about the right and wrong answers independent of their kind of sense of validation so like a kid rushed to the front of the classroom as the first one finishing a a math assignment could tell that he rushed to the front of the classroom and was the fastest one because his parents or whatever had been ingraining the you know you need to get all the right answers and be the fastest at it and rather than say oh look you got them almost all right and one wrong um good job you got a 99% but then also the pain on the one wrong Marshall looks at it and says you know I get the same answer as you for all of these ones except this one I got a different answer on this one can you walk me through how you got that one and the kid self-corrected it and said okay we got the same answer on all of these cool but then has a deep expression of the love of the kid when he sees what they are like they authentic self expressing itself not just them getting the right answer on things because then that kid might start to love math even though they don't really love math just because they figured out how to get reward circuits on it um so the type of progress that comes from a sense of fullness of what is and desire to appreciate protect maintain and add to what is is a much healthier one than the one that comes from the desire to fill an emptiness then it is important that we can that we actually believe that we can have the activity of our life leave the world better for others that's the authentic meaningful part of the progress narrative that I I've got to experience a tremendous amount of beauty I want to leave the world at least as beautiful not worse and ideally more beautiful for others and that's such a important sacred impulse that I want to rescue that from from the propagandized version that says because you grew GDP or because you got a new product or Market out there um you know a product to Market or because um you know some new piece of technology was Advanced even if it's used to destroy lots of things that that's progress It's the the reality of what authentic progress would be which is I actually left the world better better requires meaning we can say something about good and ought not just is and better for whom a more inclusive definition that includes everybody future Generations not just my people but all people not just people but other beings and a deeper definition of what is actually meaningful which is going to ground in the basis of the depth of experience and so I want a world where people feel that they can add to progress where there is something sacred about the way we think of progress and because it is so sacred a bastardized version of it is totally not okay right the bastardized version of it is a sin it's like no no the AA that we are unbelievably gifted to exist in this world at all we want to honor and protect that and that we were endowed with creative capabilities we want to use those creative capabilities to leave that kind of gift for others that I I actually want people to hold how sacred that progress impulse is and make sure that all the ways they add to the world actually meet that definition." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=6463)

this is basically the concept of the institution of nation states being able to be something like you know liberal democracies as opposed to autocracies or something else um in one way there is a really important critique that democracies have never really existed that the founding of the US had all of the shitty jobs done by slaves who had no s in the fact that they did all the shitty jobs obviously women didn't have a say of the time um and that if people had to democratically vote for the totality of what happened but where the people who were voting were also responsible for all of the Labor uh that that whole system wouldn't have worked where if they had had to actually pay Fair Labor that people would have voted for that wasn't exploitive it wouldn't have had the margins to grow the way that it did things like that um and and you see that after the Civil War was fought we didn't end slavery because the ponage system just kind of extended the slavery right the 13th Amendment said not shall not be slaves except as a punishment for a crime so a bunch of fake crimes were made up to be able to put black people in prison and put them on basically Force Labor uh again when that ended it was largely associated with globalization and the ability to ship the slavery to the third world so there are more people in indentured servitude or conditions of slavery today than there have been at any point in the history of the world and we ship most of the cheap labor and really environmentally harming things whatever to those areas that are a part of the margins of how things work so calling that democracy is kind of weird um obviously inside of the corporations those are not democracies those are basically autocracies right which do a huge amount of everything and um the military is not a democracy and Etc so there's only a little bit that was supposedly democracy and it's really hard to say that it was that thing but even in so far as it was that thing has eroded in some very significant ways that require restructuring of the entire idea set specifically that was able to happen here in the way that it was and each of the modern democracies have different but related stories because it was basically the whole continent separated seated from any kind of adversaries with oceans and that was a huge part of why certain things were possible and that you could share with the population things that you wouldn't want to share with enemies and it wouldn't instantly get to the enemy such that the people could be apprised of key decisions to make but as technology advanced and Telecommunications emerged and very good ability to spy emerged and the ability to actuate in other places through missiles and you know things much faster than ships going across the ocean emerged sharing information with the citizens equaled sharing it with the Soviets right um and sharing it with any kind of adversary and so all the things that were of importance to National Security couldn't be shared and increasingly everything started to become a an issue of National Security because issues about our water supply and key issues about our food supply and key issues about what the FED is going to do with um uh finances and you know Etc all start to be increasingly National Security things BEC increasingly classified and how do you do democracy if most of the most important decisions no one's even allowed to know any of the information about and yet in a situation of adversaries being able to listen from across the world and also being able to actuate from AC across the world how do you share all of the information that is senstive to the population this is an issue that democracy faces today that it did not face in 1776 and um let's take that one a little bit further you know when popper wrote about open society and that kind of the idea of democracy also went along with the idea of the open publishing of science everybody could know what was happening in science and Academia and be because everybody could be comprehensively educated right the the anteed for democracy in all the founding documents was the comprehensive education of everyone and the comprehensive informedness of everyone so everybody had to have public education everybody had to have a kind of uh free and independent news uh media forth estate such that the population could both had the education to make sense of things and the information to make sense of things such that they could make good informed decisions we can see that the level of Education that the American population has relative to the complexity of the issues it faces so how what understanding of the history of the Israel Palestine conflict or Ukraine Russia Dynamics or all the geopolitics involved or the risks associated with crisper or artificial intelligence or the actual condition of um dead zones and oceans like how much of the Dynamics regarding that that good regulation would need does the public understand anything about obviously the complexity of the information space has increased exponential ially and the educational quality has in many ways went down simultaneously and the news has been you know increasingly uh you know partisan IED blah blah blah so the antecedence for democracy are not in place do you have a population that is educated enough well informed enough in ways that are not just the propaganda vested interests to be able to make good choices adequate to the complexity of the choices we need to make in the time scale like obviously not even close um so there was a a study I think it was done by braver Angels or at least popularized by them that showed that since the 1970s popular opinion has 0% correlation with legislation what the people want has absolutely no effect on legislation that's crazy the amount of marketing I mean the amount of lobbying dollars has perfect correlation and so now again we come back to the topic you were asking about captured government so the kind of core idea of this liberal democracy thing was that the market would naturally get power law distributions if you just had a pure Market you end up getting a situation where some people are better at making money than others that money is power for every everything because that money is like a unit of Game Theory right it's like a token that allows you to buy private mercenaries it allows you to buy marketing it allows you to buy labor Tech whatever so if you I need to change the views of people I need to get politicians on my side I need to build some new technology I need to buy land money is something that has no intrinsic value but optionality for every type of value and so everyone started valuing money more than anything else because it represented the optionality for everything else which is obviously game theoretically relevant and so some people would be better at making money than others they those who have more money have more ability to make more money even just through compounding interest compounding interest grows faster than the General market does this is what petti showed in Capal in the 24 Century that um in the rich will get richer poor will get poor intrinsic to the system even if it wasn't for the fact also that the rich get better education and better healthare and better access to financial services you know all those types of things so you'll naturally get a power LW distribution where the wealth inequality increases over time until it's so imbalance that if you just had a market like that you didn't have a kind of state then pretty much everybody has no voice only the people the amount of voice you have to determine the world is proportional to the amount of money you have and that ends up really sucking for a lot of things right and there's a lot of things where there's Market incentive to do the thing that you we still don't want to do we we don't want to cut down all the national parks we don't want all of the markets on organs and stuff like that so we decide no we're going to have a state but we want a minimal State the job of the state is to serve the collective will of the people including the people who don't have a lot of money and the state has to be powerful enough to check the powerful forces in the market such that where the powerful forces in the market have a vested interest to do something that is actually bad for the whole and the whole all agrees we don't want that you're able check it that's really the purpose of the state is to check excesses of the market aligned with the will of the people assuming that there is both a moral and uh scientific education of all of the people and comprehensive informedness of them such that the will the people would be a good idea now so it's supposed to be that the state is checking the market but that the people are checking the state it's supposed to be a government of foreign by the people or the there's High transparency the people are not career politicians they're elected from the people you know those kinds of things and obviously we do not have a situation where the government is of foreign by the people and the people are effectively checking the state as a result the state is no longer effectively checking the market the market ends up capturing the state so if the market is going to be regulated by the state in a way that decreases its profits then its own responsibility to grow as a business is to do lobbying to change the legislation in favor of its interests now the private sector can pay for a bunch of lawyers to write a bunch of law in a way that the general people can't the and so we have a world today where the vast majority of all new law is written by the private sector in its own interests you have a situation of the revolving doors where the someone from industry moves into the position of being the regulator who's regulating in the interest of the companies they were just employed by and will be employed by again after their term is over right that revolving door so if if your FDA commissioner had worked in big farm or big a and then goes to work there afterwards like what's the chance of that's good regulation and you you'll also have things like public private Partnerships which are key to how AI is being regulated right now which is okay because the government is too slow and you guys don't really know where the current Tech is at and because you don't have the money and the budget for it we the market sector who are advancing the tech and know where it's really at and have the expertise and we can afford to do it we understand that this needs regulated there's some risks here so we're going to create a partnership between the government side and the private side well who ends up writing the operating agreement always the private side that ends up being able to pay for the lawyers and who in which interest in the interest of regulating their own activity so heavily that it affects their their Market capabilities obviously not so the almost everywhere that you see revolving doors that you see lobbying that you see public private Partnerships you see basically a state that is doing the bidding of the market and specifically what that means is the interest of some in the market not in the interest of everybody and not in the interest of the commons so is that democracy no right so for the and when you're only choices for who is an elected representative are people that nobody likes on either side and that nobody really got to have any good say up front and who might be involved in that process they just kind of came out of nowhere picked by parties and stuff and where at best you get to vote yes or no on a proposition but the proposition sucks both ways and you weren't involved in any participatory process of crafting what would be a good proposition in the first place so we we have a Kabuki theater of democracy we don't have democracy right um but we also couldn't have democracy in the 1776 Style with these issues so given that we have innovated our Tech to the place that we still have adversarial relationships with other places in the world but they can be spying on us with satellites in real time and use the information the public has and infiltrate the public through you know um us intelligence and law enforcement identified that the 16 top most popular Evangelical Facebook groups were all run by Russian troll farms and so the Russian troll Farm is curating the stuff in those groups that turns the people against other people and against the state so how do you deal with a you know powerful opponent turn them against themselves um a lot of people thought oh Russia likes Trump and China likes Biden no Russia and China both like a us that is more divided with itself and the same the way that we are with them right like the try to seow division is a is a thing is a strategy um what we want with a democracy is that the choices that affect everyone's life everyone gets to participate in the making of those choices as much as possible that people's lives are not subject to things that they have no say in and in so far as we can also really well educate everybody and um obviously even when I say we can that's a very tricky thing who is the we and what are they calling good education is a very tricky thing in so far as it is possible to have a competent and shared understanding of the world emerge and effective ability to communicate across different worldviews towards things that don't just turn into war then democracy is increasingly viable only in that cultural antecedent and the mechanisms by which that could be mediated moving forward have to be completely different than they have been before because the context is completely different." - [Daniel

^^ This is great

> "It is in the interest of the political class to have people skepticism stay partisan so as long as the Republicans say that the um Liberals are the ones who want big government and are ruining everything and ruining education and Etc and but their whole answer is to not really engage in deep Democratic process where they're involved in making sense of the world and crafting what good propositions would be and evolving the systems of government it's to get the guy that is saying that the Liberals are bad who's their guy elected to still run the system with almost none of their authentic understanding or input um and the and the Liberals doing the exact same thing then you get to take everybody's recognition that the system isn't working and keep perpetuating the system and have them all work very hard to to do something that is obviously just perpetuating the system Gregory Bateson and uh coin this term schismogenesis which is where the Schism is actually the generator of the ongoing growth in the system and so you have a movement say and it appeals to some people and it anti- appeals to other people and it's not that all movements must do that but it's that movements that are crafted in a way that let's say we have values that are in a dialectical relationship and you have to consider them together like rights and responsibilities or whatever and one emphasizes one you you have a movement that emphasizes one of these and some people who are really paying attention to that thing will really care and other people who recognize there's something really imbalanced about a care over here so you can have a movement where the success of that movement actually really scares other people in the same way that you said earlier as one nation increases its relative security it decreases the security of everybody else so now everybody else has to increase their process now that just means arms races forever is the only possible answer increasing the total killing power of the world the entire time while increasing the enmity you know of everybody so it's like this is not a good endgame so similar you have a movement that says some true things but leaves out some really important things and as a result it appeals to some people not other people or it emphasizes certain values not other ones and so that movement success drives its counter movement and so it never actually wins it's so focused on a near-term win but if it innovates any method of being more successful now we're going to use social media and elections or now we're going to whatever it is the other side instantly reverse engineers that innovates the same kinds of things and intrinsic to how one side is appealing to their support base they are anti- appealing to the other side they're actually driving the counter reaction on the other side so any attempt to change the world that is schismogenic will not create a good world and how could we move that thing forward that's very different." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=12036)

> "People should be really dubious of their own certainty um it's it's sad how much this is true but the amount that people really actually think is amazingly low and so in general if you give me four or five of someone's political views what they think on gun control what they think on abortion what they think on climate change what they think on covid whatever and I can predict the rest of their views with high accuracy it's hard to say that they're thinking they are in a mimetic complex that is the moment you identify the mtic comp complex you know the vast majority of everything that they think and so similarly if you're in a conversation with someone and pretty soon you know what their responses to most things are going to be and they're actually more predictable than chat GPT is they don't even pass the Turing test right like most people don't even pass the Turing test when you're talking to them of like are they saying anything that indicates that there is some real depth of consideration and sensient and whatever on the other side um and so uh I think David Bohm said that most people are engaged in thoughting that thoughts arise and new ideas come in they hit the person's existing cognitive biases and mimetic filters those filters either reject or accept the thought if they accept it they seek to propagate it by trying to sell other people on the idea and that pretty much they're a mostly unconscious meme filtering propagation system this is really sad and also unnecessary and so you can correct this but you have to um care about what is real more than any of your ideas about what is real and any place where your identity is associated with an idea I'm a pro-science person or I'm an antia person or I'm a Zionist or I'm a anti-zionist or I'm a conservative your identity will probably have to die when you recognize that those ideas are very limited and that there are ideas on the other side that are also good and so similarly if there are ideas that you hold on to because they support your vested interests like the the way that you make money and get the way that you got your Fame and the whatever it is is a good thing um so there is a depth of earnestness to be like no no I I actually want to understand the reality I existed I was born I don't know why I'm here for a very short period of time and then I'll be dead there's this amazing reality I didn't make I want to understand it I want to understand how it works I want to understand what's meaningful about it so that I can live in the most authentic and meaningful way possible then if that's the case then what you are more curious about than anything is your own blind spots and your own biases and you want to investigate them profoundly you don't want to ever double down on them so if if you have a you know you make a list what are all the things that I believe fervently then find who are the smartest people that disagree and really listen because they're might be people who have studied this way more than you know way more stuff and they disagree for some important reasons and maybe they're not 100% right either right in fact finding where experts disagree in a field is one of the best ways to enter the field because if they've studied the field for decades with deep earnestness more than your you know cursy understanding and they disagree it means that maybe none of the worldviews or epistemologies are adequate and you want to say can I understand why each of them think what they do can I understand where the difference is and maybe because I'm not as invested is there a chance I might be more plastic and I could see is there a view in which there are partial truths in what each of them are saying and so to just look at where do I hold fervently to something and who are the smartest people that disagree and really try to take it in that will do so much to improve the quality of your thinking your understanding of the world and also just the quality of you as a human being who will lead with more respect with other people that will have more authentic humility one of the other things like any when you start to learn about a topic there's this Dunning Krueger process right where before you know a lot about it you can have confidence in it because you just don't know how much stuff you don't know and then as you learn more you become aware how much you don't know if you really stay attuned to how much stuff is there like per peruse more scientific journals and just look at how many words all The Cutting Edge stuff is being talked about that you just have no idea what the they're talking about at all I don't know what this kind of proteomics is and I don't know what this kind of Transformer is and I don't know what this kind of metafluid is and I don't know and just start to do take in more of how much you have no idea about things and the certainty gets replaced with both curiosity and humility and awe and as a result you start learning a lot more and the fascinating thing is you learn a lot more so your views get more accurate and less certain at the same time a world in which everybody worked to have a lot more epistemic rigor and also is aware of how much they don't know so there's still humility in every situation and conversation uh that's a world that would actually be capable of some kind of democratic process working." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=12296)

> "A smart person can rationalize and the interesting thing is that rationalizing is the opposite of rationality right the idea of rationality is we're taking some like hopefully clear formal process of assessing the world rationalization is you come to a belief based on ingroup Identity or motivated reasoning or whatever types of things and then you rationally backfill why you came there but the reason that you say you came there and why you actually came there aren't the same but you probably have low enough psychological insight that you don't realize that and um so one should be very very attentive to their own rationalization and motivated reasoning um but the other thing is that the smart person because they have an identity as a smart person and maybe they are a they have a job as a smart person supported by the people who support them to believe that stuff because they speak to an audience on the left or an audience on the right who wants them to be the smart person who says those things where if they started saying more nuanced things they would lose their support base um so it's not just that they're better capable of rationalizing it might also be that they start to get success and identity associated with narrow applications of smart just like narrow applications of progress." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/LSx8j8lSewA?t=12711)




> "When you think about what value is and Gaffney always says value is clarified desire it's a way to think about it advertising is what Distortion of Desire very very very fundamentally disregulating your ability to know what's actually valuable and actually very systematically trying to convince you that this is actually valuable even when it's not worth anything - maybe it's bad for you. So the Distortion of your ability to clarify your own desire and the clarification of your own desire being the thing that gets you in touch with reality is why what you're talking about is so Insidious it's like a spiritual warfare because they are distorting our will and manipulating our perception of what we want what's worth wanting uh yep it's like there's no... like again education you know media literacy was removed from schools because of its power to diffuse certain forms of advertising and propaganda specifically so in like Eastern European countries you still have media literacy uh which means like you teach kids in school about here's how advertising Works here's how propaganda works like here's they don't do that in the United States um and uh they could now when you do see it done they do it against one party they basically say anything that comes from the right is propaganda other say something like that right but that's not the same thing as showing the structural mechanisms that make propaganda and advertising different from good faith educational communication right so yeah I think we're in a kind of almost a dark age as a result of the iquity of strategic communication over good faith communication which means just everything's advertising like war is everywhere um in that sense of everything's trying to predate you uh it's like a default experience the youth often have is the adults are not protecting me from these massive companies who are making money by damaging my brain and the adults aren't able to set rules for the kids and so the kids are confused kids actually want rules that's one of the most important things about teacherly Authority is the ability to set rules and the kids are like oh thank God there's someone who knows what's going on because I don't and so if you can't set rules around things and the kids know and they've seen the social dilemma and the parents still aren't doing anything and the Senators still aren't doing anything it's like okay we're not protecting you we are endorsing low-grade child abuse uh you know so yeah it's a it's uh again it's hard to say uh with enough Clarity it's harder than the situation of like oh there look at the little six-year-old girl in the mine like mining in like you know dickin son in England or something I was like oh we had labor laws we put in child labor laws to protect the kids from the corporations." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/Io8rTJyQ2JM?t=5681)



> "I believe that the long-term solutions look pretty meaningfully different than the social solutions humans have tried so far like i don't think the very long-term solutions are nation-state-based um i don't think they look like a single type of fungible currency and primarily private property ownership or whatever rule of law enforced by monopoly of violence in the same way i'm talking about many generations from now i'm not going to get into that because that's that's hard what i will say is nation states and global markets and and you know rule of law at the level of states is going to be what continues to primarily be how civilization operates for the next couple generations at least and so we have to make that system meaningfully better how do we vector it in the right direction and so i'm going to be assuming our existing types of institutions and looking at how to correct some of the institutional decay that has occurred i think institutional decay is an important concept because some people naively still run this idea of a continuous dialectic of progress where things just get better and better and better as a result of say technology and accumulated learning and i think it's very clear to see with the loss of the burning of alexandria in the dark ages and the loss of the uh you know classical greek enlightenment and whatever there's actually periods of emergence of things getting better and then getting worse in meaningful ways and cyclicality and and major empires and civilizations do fall the important thing to understand is when the roman empire fell or when the byzantine or maya or aztec or egyptian empire fell they were not fully globalized civilizations they were still local civilizations because of globalization if the kind of civilization stat meaning how it does its modes of production falls now like every other one always has its scope of consequence is unprecedented but failure is not unprecedented in fact there's no other precedent okay so coming back to the idea of a liberal democracy for a moment i'm going to make this kind of u.s centric and immediate is roughly you've got these kind of three sectors you've got this market thing you've got this state thing and you've got this civil society thing that is not market or state but is uh religions and community groups and other places where basically the cultural values act so the rough idea and i'm not saying that this is adequate or true but the rough kind of idea is uh okay the we're gonna let the market do most of the modes of production and most of the incentive and most of the innovation because it's good at it and we don't want a central government that is too strong trying to do too much of that because we founded this country getting away from excessive powers of government and we want something that is more individual self-determining but we're not doing a pure laissez-faire market either we still make a state because we like the idea of rule of law because a market will have a market for nasty things like slaves and organs and uh whatever uh and so things that we like to call crime and be able to have a force to stop them and specifically it's recognized that even if if at t equals zero i gave everyone an exact equal amount of money in enough period of time we would get a power law distribution no matter what because some people are better at making money with it and then having more money gives them more ability to make more money and so the the power ends up being auto poetic and falling on power law distribution so then how how do the few people up here who have the incentive and capacity to maintain their asymmetric power not be excessively kind of inhumane to the rest of everybody else well everybody else pulls their power into this thing called a government of foreign by the people estate that has monopoly of violence it's going to have even more power than the most powerful economic actors have and it can bind them with rule of law and rule of law is where our cultural our values because the basis of jurisprudence is ethics right the basis of ethics is some kind of value system or metaphysics so we have some kind of value system that is the basis of jurisprudence at the basis of rule of law we bequeath a monopoly of violence to enforce rule of law to a state that had to be able to check largely the predatory aspects of markets the primary kind of role of the state's enforce rule of law is largely to keep people from doing things that they would otherwise have an incentive to do people or corporations and uh where we agree that that's not a good thing to do so the idea is that the purpose of the state is largely checking predatory aspects of markets while keeping functional aspects of markets but that's only possible as long as the people are checking the state because otherwise the representatives in the state will end up the market will seek to capture those representatives the watchdog issue the classic libertarian critique and think hey instead of regulating against my interest regulate in my interest and you'll have better houses in the hamptons and swiss bank accounts and a re-election budget and whatever else and given that lobbyists are paid for by somebody and election budgets have to come from somewhere and whatever and then you start to get revolving door dynamics so the founding fathers knew this so they said you know comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government adequate fourth estate the government of formed by the people people actively involved and it'll probably break down and it'll break down for these reasons as the people won't stay actively involved because it's too expensive um and mo it's very easy to complain about government while not actively investing hardly any of our life and trying to be involved in governance yeah and then we're basically de facto consenting to be ruled and just complaining so the idea is that if you want to prevent the kind of decay of a republic into crony capitalism and eventually a kleptocracy and an autocracy the basis of it has to be a comprehensively educated public who knows how to make sense of the types of things that occur like market incentives like narrative and info warfare like problems with political science etc and who are both comprehensively educated in knowing how to make sense of stuff who know how to communicate dialectically with people who see stuff differently because they know that's how you sublimate war and who have some access to current information i.e a good fourth estate so that they but where they still have the capacity to parse it and sense make it themselves if you don't have that as a basis you do not have the possibility for participatory governance there is no republic there's just an illusion of it well it's actually some kind of um oligarchy or something so the goal of consensus project is the acknowledgements that the two of the pillars of or like not even pillars prerequisites for democracy or a republic or subsidiary or participatory governance of any kind are an adequate public education that is teaching people how to make sense of the world well enough that they can participate in governance and a fourth estate that's giving people information about the current world that actually gives them it is an information commons right that gives them the access to the information that they need to be without distortion be able to meaningfully do sense making on it so they can do choice making and what i would say is that both public education and news and a bunch of other things have gone through institutional decay where they are no longer serving that function and the prerequisites or the antecedents of democracy don't exist and we have to basically reboot them and i'm not trying to reboot them through a top-down process of how do we get government to fix public education and get adequate civics and whatever or legislate news but a bottom-up process of how do we actually just start to educate people about the fact that right now the right is pretty sure that the left news is fake news and lying and the left things the rights news is fake news line what they don't get is that all the news is fake news and lying to various degrees but if we can show across the whole news landscape either fake facts or if not fake facts at least cherry picked facts yes this fact was true but these 10 other facts were omitted that give you a very different sense and then it was contextualized and spun like this so even if it's not full-on lying it's still misleading in the nature of curing contextual nonsense right and so there's a kind of media literacy that people would need and you know why drain the swamp was so effective is people feel corruption as a real thing and people don't want to be manipulated but to the degree that someone's saying they're manipulating you so trust me that's an effective manipulation tactic um and so what we actually need is for people to start trusting their own capacity for better sense making and have that trust be warranted because they're actually getting better at sense-making and not just individually but collectively meaning i'm also getting better at not just trying to sense make-based reality but try to understand what do other people think and why do they think that so that because i know that if i just try to ignore or cancel a big part of the population they don't stop existing and acting they do stuff and if i do effective stuff they'll do effective counter stuff and strategy means factoring counter response so if i want to do that effectively i'm going to be better if i can actually understand them and see if there is some way to be able to work towards um better shared solutions so the consensus project is looking at can we actually reboot a republic here can we reboot participatory governance in some way and even deeper than that globally we're not really succeeding with the sdgs very well we are not we didn't do nuclear disarmament sustainable development goals yeah any of the large global issues we're not doing uh preventing the ai arms race or whatever we we we're mostly not doing a good job at global problem solving and that's a coordination issue either we don't understand how to solve it or what some people think a solution is other people actively are opposing or you get multi-polar traps where there's things like arms race race to the bottom type scenarios to solve the coordination jews requires some kind of shared choice making and the basis of that is shared sense making communication and that and the base of that is not in a state or market but in culture right a value system around better sense making and better good faith dialogue right now those are not even highly valued things they're not trained but they're not even very highly valued." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/Z_wPQCU5O6w?t=4308)

> "I mean i really appreciated your conversation with general mcmaster where he was talking about empathy because it didn't seem soft and feminine and it actually seemed directly relevant both to preventing war and being successful at war and i think it was it's a it's an important frame that empathy is not the thing that people who are unaware of conflict theory do and that makes you kind of bad at conflict theory or or winning um sun tzu saying do you understand the opponent and if you're going into battle you don't effective at unders i have to understand my opponent but also to be able to prevent war to be able to sublimate it through some kind of political compromise i have to actually really get what the other people think and feel and need to say what are the right solutions here so um i think empathy i mean and this is this is actually partly why sociopaths oftentimes have higher cognitive empathy than the average person but lower embodied empathy is that they're good at modeling someone else's theory of mind to gain theoretically beat them but without actually caring um and so you can weaponize empathy and that's something we have to be very careful about um that's you know cult leaders are good at that cluster b disorders are good at kind of a weaponized empathy uh but uh okay do you want me to stay on the empathy mindfulness or come back to the what do i see as the critical parts of the solution because i think that it's not purely cognitive right the development that we need in people is not purely cognitive training to be able to understand existential risks and climate change and and even social science and politics it's also if they move into outrage too quickly if they move into overwhelm too quickly they're going to be useless or problematic or make things worse so there's also an emotional intelligence and you know you go back to looking at like the greeks exploring this the stoic school and the aristotelian school and the socratic school kind of were all parts of something that was more complete together that weren't complete on their own right the aristotelian school was can we actually understand the formal logic and the kind of scientific thinking and natural philosophy to make sense of base reality together the socratic schools can we understand each other can we take all of the various perspectives in the debate the stoic schools can we understand ourselves enough that we don't get hijacked by our own emotions if we can understand base reality we can understand each other and we can understand ourselves we can start to get somewhere and so in terms of what is the necessary cultural enlightenment of this time it definitely requires at least all three of those facets. **Host:** fair enough and um talk a little bit more about how you're going to achieve some or all of that with or i know you said it's not an entirely it's not an entire solution set but talk about how consilience project is going to be valuable in that end to that end yeah so if you don't mind. **Daniel:** Two major kind of parts of it there's a kind of movement coalescing part and a kind of education and content part the education and content part is us working on developing something like better news and which is the assessment of base reality so what are the most consequential things happening in the world and what do we know what is an overview of the topic that is we can't say unbiased but we can say bias corrected i'll explain that in a minute what do we have high certainty on about this topic what do we have low certainty on why do we think it's consequential and what are the questions we're asking and the indicators we're watching to see how this thing unfolds and even framing it that way helps educate people how to be better sense makers for them to even notice in themselves where do i have high confidence or do i have low confidence and what is my basis of confidence did i just come to high confidence emotionally or because a leader that i like said it i didn't look at the data myself right so even just starting to calibrate those things and then to emphasize questions more than propositions and think about why something is consequential that factors second and third order effects this is all giving people information but also training them how to process information by the way that we're processing it built into the presentation but then if someone's like well why did you come to that certainty why would i trust you we like don't trust us actually trust your own ability to make sense of things if you so here's this weekly intelligence report of critical things going on but and we're trying to present it as simply as possible but if you want to click under the hood you can see how we derived it what things did we read what data sets did we look at how did we make sense of it how what epistemic models did we apply and how did we calibrate confidence now it's kind of a better than but parallel to a peer-reviewed scientific study on what's actually going on there's some parallel to that there is some parallel to that and so now somebody can look at it and one if they think we missed the data set or miss waited something they can let us know and we will be continuously updating our models and correcting our positions transparently right which is really important including doing retrospectives of where we got things wrong or missed stuff which is another important thing is a kind of epistemic humility for people to not be focused on being right but focused on earnest inquiry which involves being very clear where you're wrong and uh but also they get to see like wow if this if i didn't have this order to make sense of it for me if i went and looked at all of these different types of news sources from different countries and different political perspectives and i applied these models and i parsed it this way i could make better sense of stuff too so right it's teaching people sense making and then also hopefully well okay that's one part so basically that's the news the meta news is where we're not making sense of base reality but we're making sense of the media landscape and helping people have a better kind of media literacy and understanding of the narrative in info warfare so that they kind of get inoculated against it was it i think one of the newspapers in washington post or something and as soon as i mentioned any newspaper everyone's going to have their built-in biases about the biases of the paper but one of them used to publish documents like the government released this statement and then would have sort of journalists commenting on the document on the way down it was a pretty neat tool um to help us unders when they say this they're trying to you know fool you with anc you know blah blah you know yeah so that kind of commentary right so what we're seeking to do here is that this project is a non-profit it commits to have no profit stream it won't put anything behind a pay wall won't sell anybody's data won't have ads and so uh there's no vested interest in that way the articles that are written are all written by the house like the economist no journalists names are on them to both make it safer for them to say what's true even if it's controversial um and for people to have to deal with the content as the content rather than have a kind of ad hominem or identity politics approach to it um and the organization will shut down after five years the nonprofit has a five year time to live so that it's not a progressive jobs program or career opportunity for anybody and it's not positioned to have a part of the power landscape it's trying to catalyze something trying to catalyze something culturally that will happen outside of it so any group that's trying to do good sense making couldn't see us as being in competition we only succeed long term if we get a lot of other groups to succeed and so i'll mention that in a moment the movement building part yeah that's a big question i have the meta news part is where we take some topic that is trending and highly polarized like masks or hydroxychloroquine or lab origins of covid or whatever it is and or police violence as a function of institutional racism in the us and we start by saying what is the landscape of primary narrative sometimes there's just two narratives there's kind of a left and a right narrative or whatever sometimes there's like five narratives there's also like a strong libertarian critique of both there's a conspiracy narrative whatever and of course there's a thousand sub-variants but they kind of cluster to some primary narrative structures or tropes so we do this thing in the meta news saying here's the narrative landscape of the things that are trending that a lot of people believe sure and then we steel man each narrative which is the opposite of straw manning which means we try to make the strongest case for it possible because most people who aren't in a narrative either don't know that the narrative exists or can only think that the people who believe it are just kind of dumb and bad they don't have a compelling understanding of why anyone could believe that thing because the version that that their social media algorithm is curating is the one that will appeal to outrage for them or whatever so we want to actually be able to help people understand actually what is com what the narratives are what's compelling about them this part of the socratic process of do we understand each other then we want to convert those narratives to a bunch of propositions and say what evidence is given to support these and then beyond that what evidence can we find to either formally falsify or verify and if we can't falsify or verify can we at least find things that make it more or less likely and how do we calibrate that so we're teaching people first to assess a narrative landscape then to empathize with other people in the form of can i try to really steel man their argument which is also good faith dialogue right then analytic propositional logic can i actually go through and because what will oftentimes happen is like this is true this is true therefore these eight propositions you already got me on these two these have no data but the people just kind of believe it right and that that type of thing we want to go through and be able to say because then what we'll also be able to show is in everyone's narrative there's some true stuff there is some signal which is actually also very important to realize then we can also see that across most of them there's some falsifiable like clearly nonsense but also a lot of just cherry-picked and spun stuff and then a lot of stuff that's pure conjecture that we can either falsify nor verify that is basically just spin or whatever we usually have low confidence then we step back and say what can we say with high confidence about this topic after having looked at all this so we're not saying unbiased we're saying we're taking each bias on purpose so we can bias correct right um so now one of the things that will happen is we'll also be able to show exemplars of each of the narratives like the top news sources and show okay here's where they put spin on this thing here's where the nature of the title is misleading but it's what you walk away with from what the actual science said or whatever and here's where they cherry picked so people start looking for cherry picking they start looking for spin all over the place so they're getting inoculated against the tools of memetic and narrative warfare and as a result tribalism and strong leader dynamics and whatever and starting to actually think so there so news meta news then there's some other deeper education stuff long form pieces about things going on in the world if you really want to understand well what's going on in the china-india border or with 5g or whatever it is deeper things in there but again what we're doing is trying to teach people how to make sense of the world in the process of making sense of something they care about now that is largely to start being a strange attractor of people who are seeking better information and showing people what the fourth estate could be to increase demand for higher quality things to try to create a race to the top in the media environment rather than the race to the bottom of more salacious shorter et cetera that has been there so then in the movement coalescing side we're working on putting together innovation challenge okay so then just to locate people so what you've just described is an extraordinarily gorgeous orchestra of information that i would love to see i'm excited to be part of um you know as as you've just painted it that would be an unbelievably immense and beautiful gorgeous thing to read to look at to to see and learn from now you would you say movement building and and i know we're gonna run out of time quickly you're can you describe i guess faster than yeah how do you get it sounds like an elite focused thing how do you get the rest of the country that to pay attention to this as we started building this and started reaching out to advisors and people working in the space we started finding hundreds of really brilliant projects to increase sense making public dialogue that just either didn't recognize themselves as part of a movement or needed help getting a certain kind of traction so there were some groups who had built uh tech that could be made as a web browser plugin and fact check any site that you're on news sites highlight things that look like facts and then identify data sources where you can go check those facts and that should be a web browser plug-in everybody has and it should be continuously getting assessed and being made better there was another group based on lakhov's work that made a kind of semantic processor that could identify across new sources narrative framing and show the frames that were being used show news organizations using the same frames and where you could look at the same topic across different framings of it that should be a web browser plug-in that everybody has so they can understand the principles of statistical cherry picking and data manipulation and narrative manipulation but then they can web browser plug it and see it in real time and the stuff that they're scrolling on facebook when it pops up they can see those things and so then that starts to create an incentive to find the ones that are less manipulated which starts to create a race to the top of an orientation of the media to offer different supply because the demand is changing through education but those types of projects were like man we really want to help those projects succeed because some of them just were like a few computer scientists working on their own they got to it but then they don't have the resources to take it further or an academic institute a media lab got it somewhere but then it's not part of their mandate to take it further so we're like we want to host innovation prizes we also saw people who were doing really good jobs of like making cartoons to teach american history and civics to high school kids but it hasn't scaled it was like being done in one town but that same thing should scale all over the place what's that like the oatmeal i don't know the oatmeal oh you don't my god okay there we go you check it out when we're done you're gonna love it there are people who are working on how to make peer review better or remove bias in journalism or bias in academic science or get better at identifying state-sponsored narrative warfare in the u.s other states and what we're saying is those are all parts of one issue that people haven't recognized as one issue which is the breakdown of sense making writ large and i think by even bringing them into one environment they start to get more self-awareness that these are all parts of one thing and there is a cultural movement towards valuing sense making a dot and high quality dialogue as the basis of our capacity to solve problems and then our ability to curate the resources that are actually good and direct people to the resources that are good the ability to create forums for the right kinds of interactions where the architectures incent good sense making in good faith dialogue and prizes that help both new projects emerge and that change the nature of demand for existing projects and where the products we're making are really like prototyping and then open sourcing what it could be and encouraging anyone to rip it off like you want to take this to your country and implement it or locality or whatever awesome so the goal is movement catalyzing in a finite period of time and education and kind of the attractor basis i love that i thought you were going to describe how to build a movement to get people to look at the consilience project you're talking about using the consilience project to create a movement on a couple of levels a movement towards driving people to higher quality journalism and movement towards sort of an incubator of great tools to help that happen etc uh that's that's fascinating um we're running out of time quickly so go ahead the the underlying just is that there's a commons just like there's a commons of air or water that can easily fall prey to tragedy of the commons dynamics there's an information in epistemic commons the data the data we need and the processing on that data we need to make sense of the world to decide what good solutions for anything are and that information epistemic commons is not stewarded right it's gruesomely polluted and it's there's maximum incentive to manipulate that commons." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/Z_wPQCU5O6w?t=5214)

> "Now this is key this is actually the essential criteria that makes micro rivalry lead to macro symbiosis is the symmetrical power binding imagine for a moment that I could make a mutation where Lions got a hundred times better at killing in one generation well in that one generation they would kill all the gazelles they'd eat them all and then they would go extinct and so what we would find is that those species that were so much more effective than their environment could actually navigate in that crate resilience - would self terminate because of their own effectiveness in dependent upon of the ecological niche they depend upon they would be debasing the substrate upon which they depend through their over over expression and we see this virus happens virus comes about it is so lethal that it kills the host before it gets to umm actually propagate and then less virulent versions of that virus get to propagate more and nature actions of selecting for a virus that's moving more in the direction of symbiosis than just lethality right yes yeah and so evolution itself has this symmetrical power binding why this is so fucking critical to understand is because nature does not select for individuals of a species and it doesn't even select for species it seems to over the very short term but as you zoom out over the long term it selects for self-stabilizing ecological niches where the particular members of a species that seem like they're getting selected for over the short term that are super lethal over the long term self-terminate and so the things that make it through long term are these radically anti-fragile symbiotic systems and so we said so okay we get that in nature and we we look at the most badass apex predators in nature whether we're looking at a lion or a shark or whatever and we look at a lion killing a gazelle compared to what a human factory farm of cows looks like right and we look at a shark eating a tuna compared to a mile long drift more if a mile long like if fucking great whites got mile-long drift nets the whole ocean would have not existed a long time ago and so as soon as we developed technology and the ability to double down on technology we broke the power symmetry and we have to think about two applications humans with regard to other humans and humans with regard to the rest of nature that they depend upon so humans with regard to other humans the most powerful lion is not that much most powerful than then more powerful than the next most powerful lion and it's not even that much more powerful than the average lion or even one of the weaker lions if you think about it like the most powerful lion is maybe 1.1 or 1.2 X more powerful than that the upper incoming lion who will overtake him soon now look at human power distributions and say how much more destructive power does a Putin or a Trump have than you do a lot more dangerous crazy yeah like the ability to destroy the whole planet versus the ability to like maybe hit somebody right and maybe you can get a gun right and you look at here okay I don't know is that nine is that there's a magnitude it's a lot okay well that's a huge fucking power asymmetry now humans with regard to nature we can cut down the forest much much much faster than forces forest can replenish we can use up resources faster than they can replenish we can create toxicity faster than they can replenish etc as a result that's why the ohm den loop dynamics matter so much is because nature cannot actually process the speed of transitions that we are making right and because we are increasing our predatory capacity faster than the environment can evolve because the technology is a second creative process what we would call design is not - design is a consciously mediated abstraction oriented process evolution is an unconsciously mediated non abstract eminent kind of process evolution leads to radical interdependent complexities technology allows the selection over the short term of something that has independent of its relationship with the rest of the whole and so if we as soon as we get that those are mathematically fundamentally different design gives us complicated systems that are all fragile you notice everything that humans build the house that I'm in can't repair itself the way that a fight that have forced what if a fire took in the computer I'm on doesn't repair itself knowing my body does so design gives us a finite number of parameters that we can then externally build something for right complicated systems but very very powerful complexity antifragility happens by self-organization we don't really know how to do that but we do know how to debase it we know how to have the complicated debase the complex substrate upon which it depends that's how we get increasing fragility as we have collapse so why this matters is technology itself is a fundamentally new creative process in the history of local universe it breaks the power symmetry and as a result it makes micro rivalry turn into macro rivalry rather than micro rivalry turn into macro symbiosis as a result rather than get increasing antifragility we get increasing fragility towards inevitable collapse dynamics and so what that means is the relationship between the creative process called technology creating complicated systems and the relationship between the evolutionary creative process creating complex systems the relationship between those is the thing that we actually have to change and modulate because we still have rivalrous basis for choice humans choosing against each other in a reverse way that came from evolution but now extended through design technology complicated systems the our understanding of causal principles optimization in a way where the rival risk dynamics are no longer checked in a way that creates any balance so what we actually need is a new creative process a new process by which new stuff comes into existence that is neither evolution nor design it is a third thing or not designing parts to we're not designing individual pieces of technology that empower rivalrous choice-making basis we are and we're not waiting for anti rivalry at a macro level through evolutionary process we are actually designing self-stabilizing complex ecological niches and designing in the relationship between the complicated and the complex to be itself metastable that what we would call evolution by design or you know sometimes referred to as transcendental design is a actual different mathematical process of new stuff coming into being than either evolution or designers and we can see that at the heart of it design is all about the understanding of causation we can understand the law we can understand how a causal dynamic works you can make a tool that allows us to manipulate that law right so science is the understanding of causation and then technology is the application of it to have more effective causation to be able to cause stuff at larger scale but our basis for choice science and give us a good basis for choice because its first person in science studies third person which is why it said we say what is not what on our basis for choice is still coming from social Darwinism so coming from a rivalries evolutionary basis those two together is an unstable system heading towards collapse we actually need it in a theory of choice beyond games theory beyond social Darwinism that can be an adequate container for our causal dynamics and to be able to actually hold the relationship between choice and causation appropriate to have metastability that is if you want to talk about the macro level of the generator functions of X risk it is the relationship between choice and causation within the field of change and the necessity for a theory of and systems of right choice making at the level of individuals and collectives that can steward the level of causal power that we have through technology in ways that will create systems that are actually anti fragile and meta state." -

> "So at first I'm going to have a lot of awareness on how much important stuff I don't know but like duh right like of course that's the case so if you really care you don't get frustrated and give up you if you really care you're like I'm happy to dedicate years to really deep understanding or my my whole life and Implement what I am understanding and then see if it's effective and then iterate again because what else am I here for um it is so couple things when people start understanding how interconnected all the world issues are so you build the dam to save some fossil fuels with hydroelectric but then you killed a whole bunch of species and you caused War Downstream between you know the the people whose ecosystem got screwed and the people Upstream who were getting the hydroelectric or whatever and you're like wow it seemed like a good idea in a narrow way but in a wide way it actually caused all kinds of problems when you when you start studying that at first you feel paralyzed because anything that you think of to improve something is either going to fail or if it succeeds it's going to make something worse but that's only because you don't know how all the systems interact enough to come up with something that is good for that area and whose externalities are all positive after a little while you start figuring that out and then those Solutions are radically more powerful than the other Solutions because all of the stakeholders can come on board so let me just give you a for instance let's say we take people who've been working in regenerative agriculture for a long time trying to you know fight big a and they have a really hard time because you know big a has a lot more money and a lot more lobbying capability and you know whatever and lawsuit capability law fair capability than a bunch of little regenerative Farmers have so yeah don't go pick a fight with someone way bigger like that's not smart so who is bigger than big a that is being harmed by what Big A is doing and doesn't know it yet well think about it I'm going to give us stats because I know them we could pull the Australian stats they probably proportion wise in a similar range so if you look at the negative health effects of conventional agriculture both the pesticides herbicides fungicides that come into people's bodies that cause chronic health issues plus the demineralized soil from the fertilizer that also causes health issues and you look at the Total Health Care spend and what percentage of all the health care spend is on issues that food from regenerative agriculture would solve for the US there's a complex attribution analysis you would do but it's roughly $3 trillion a year of health care costs that would go away that we're spending on deficit of money we don't have and so if the treasury looks at that and says man we're in a war over the reserve currency of the world with China right now it is our it is absolutely critical we maintain it our huge deficit spending is a problem Healthcare is the single biggest area of spend and we could cut it in half via the regenerative agriculture and oh by the way the regenerative agriculture is actually at Market parity with conventional agriculture if we weren't subsidizing the conventional agriculture it's not even a market we're subsidizing the big thing in the name of food security but it's really just because the big companies know how to lobby for subsidies better so then we tell TR treasury hey just remove the subsidies that's all and maybe move them to the other side and then we'll be able to the then $5 trillion dollar of capital markets will divest from the thing that's no longer Prof profitable move into the thing that is profitable and as a uh result of that now and it didn't cost the government any money they just had to move a subsidy from one thing to another thing and now they save trillions in healthcare spend you tell the dod hey these falling sperm counts correspond to Falling test Fone counts which is why you can't get guys to join the military anymore the number one source of that is actually from agricultural chemicals we can change this and you can get military guys again so now you've got Treasury and DOD going against big a and finan and big Capital markets just following their own Market incentive because you figured out how to change a subsidy this is an example of when you realize okay so this it's not just that every new solution we might want to do causes problems elsewhere it's all the solutions that current currently exists are causing problems everywhere else and then we try to solve those other problems with another solution that does it and the whole thing is basically a racket right but as soon as you understand that you can say hey if we're going to solve a problem where the current way the problem's being solved externalizes a lot of harm we're going to remove a problem for lots of other actors who can now get on our side to want to do this thing so in battle planning there's a term called correlation of force and means correlation of force and means means how many tanks do they have how many tanks do we have how much artillery blah blah blah how many troops and you can kind of anticipate is this a battle we got to back out of or send more troops to or whatever if you're going to try to change something it is the way that it is not for no reason it's the way that it is by the extremely active activity strategized activity of people who know how to do stuff right the factory farms aren't there just because nobody could figure out how to do something else um and the same with the military manufacturer so if you want to change it you're saying I want the most powerful entities in the world to not get what they want right I I am going against vested interests okay well make sure that you have correlation of force and mean set up properly because let's say you work your butt off of a bunch of nonprofits to get a law passed so you ban single-use Plastics or or something but what made it that way in the first place you didn't change which is all the fiscal incentives to externalize the cost rather than not that law won't last very long soon as you move attention off of it lobbyists will go back and change it back and they'll usually change it back with protections that make it harder to change back the other way so getting a law passed is never the thing there's no static thing that's a thing the thing is are there more forces working on the side of the commons then are working on the side of private rival RIS interest at the expense of the Comm so this is an example of at first when you see how interconnected everything is it's disempowering because to solve anything requires knowing a lot but then you do the work to know a lot and you're like oh wow now I can actually come up with solutions that don't make things worse and because they make things better not just in this specific area but in all these other areas I can get the partners needed to actually make the thing happen in the face of the formidable opposition that's there." -

^^ this is a really important clip and a point I've never heard Daniel make before

> "When i was thinking about theory of governance and theory of economics and like that it fundamentally came down to well the basis of governance is going to be rule of law rule of law is going to be based on jurisprudence jurisprudence is based on ethics there's an existentialism of what is good we can't answer these things with the philosophy of science as long as i have an is odd distinction um where science can say what it is but can't say what aw then it can build better and better technologies to affect what is with no basis to guide in which way other than market theory and game theory which ends up self-terminating at increasing power so how do we get a metaphysics that can is it possible to have a non-relativistic ethics that is commensable with the philosophy of science that can bridge the is autumn distinction and be a refined basis for a theory of governance i still like that idea but i've kind of given up on the idea that in any reasonable time frame there's going to be some integrated metaphysics that everybody buys and things was properly derived and properly closed." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ammJN0yCCbs?t=3882)

> "Sacred and sacrifice have the same etymology and so what is sacred to me is something i'm willing to make sacrifices for and what is essentially sacred is what is worth more to me than my life and if i know what is worth more to me than my life and i make sure that the choices of my life - not just giving my life but giving my living is aligned with that, that's very helpful - and if i hold that life itself with a capital L is sacred and sentient and experiences then i would never unduly harm it and it can be because we're all sparks of the same god or because we're all facets of the same self or because consciousness emerged out of these brains and we die soon and we want people to have the best experiences they can and the short little bit of sentience like i said and kind of work with any of those but but there are some you can't really work with because they orient towards not recognizing life as sacred or meaningful um so you were talking about the no self idea there is there is a way that there are interpretations of buddhist thought that can make someone a nihilist because if this is all maya none of it's real including that hungry kid isn't real and my desire to go feed them is actually the sign of my unenlightenment and ignorance that i bought into this maya so that's not just making them annihilus it's making them a sociopath through adopting a spiritual idea that disconnects them from empathy and experience and so that idea doesn't work and the same idea that if somebody prays to the wrong other god you have to kill them um or that because it's there's no free will and consciousness is an adaptive illusion might as well just unibomber everything so there there are versions of them that don't work right but there are versions of all of those that end up leading to a kind of respect for the integrity of life that orients us to behave as stewards of it and i can i can kind of work with any of those but when we're talking about the kind of society we want to make and we're talking about governance governance is a process of shared choice making so then what is the basis of the choice we make well it's epistemology and ethics it's our sense-making of what is and what the effects of a particular injunction will be a law or a technology or whatever and it's our value set of what is valuable what is meaningful that we want to make choices in service to so our ability for collective choice making through something like democracy or any process like that is going to be grounded in our ability for collective sense making which means individual sense making an ability to communicate effectively and ability to explicate what we value and what we're trying to serve with a particular injunction understand other people's values and find higher order dialectics of values to then be able to come up with strategies that can meet everyone's values aligned with what we're sensing more effectively." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/ammJN0yCCbs?t=3882)

> "Yeah well it and and i mean the tree of knowledge affords a particular kind of perspective on this at first at it from an analytic perspective uh it does grant a particular access around complexification and then the complexification is the differentiation of parts that then get unified in particular ways and i think you can see a lot of what you know a unity differentiation and even what it sort of at least abstracts is ultimately sort of there are complexification processes that then have to come together as it say and just at a general level have to fight off we'll say entropy okay uh and so entropy is constantly working against complexification you have to pull in at a physics level you have to pull in what's called a free energy rate density flow yeah uh to use off of error liaisons this basic model yeah and i think we even you know maybe add some exchange in relation relationship that but and then you can track if i would argue a free energy information flow if you bring in like carl fristan's work um and you can put on top of that and the tree of knowledge then just tracks this evolution of complexification and then you can ask questions kind of systematically about what affords that neg entropic complexified organization and there are certain consistent processes that then begins and i believe a lot of our value systems our investment value systems yes oriented in relationship to this kind of harmonizing megan tropic structure that is well positioned against the forces of entropy at higher and higher levels of complexification which means that essentially the gravity of entropy is working harder and harder and you have to be in more and more oriented flow to maintain that structure because there's more and more forces that are pulling against you you can extrapolate that concept at least from a tree of knowledge perspective and you place the garden on top of the tree of knowledge and then you place what's called the elephant sun god on top of that and then that becomes essentially your ultimate transcendent concern a load star in relationship to trying to maintain the forces of nag entropy that afford the complexification that give rise to the kinds of things that we call good true and beautiful." - [Gregg Henriques](https://youtu.be/_7n49YOr4B8?t=2806)
