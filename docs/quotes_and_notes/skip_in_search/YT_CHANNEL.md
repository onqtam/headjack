GLING VS DESCRIPT:
- filler word removal:
    gling has the best mistake removal
    gling: automatic & timeline-centric
    descript: manual & transcript-centric
- fixing wrong words
    descript: lets you change words in the transcript and overdub & crossfade them automatically with your voice using AI - but does it also do video - not just audio?


gling can export to davinci so I don't need to use their renderer (if it's shit - some say it is)

- eye contact:
    - descript - 35$ a month 
    - Captions.ai - 10$ month
    - CapCut - but seems a bit shitty

# CHANNEL STUFF
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

uploading:
- don't immediately publish - wait for HD to be ready
- don't share with friends & unrelated audiences
- don't open it yourself and add fake views - leave it to the algo - maybe this is BS

channel:
- more professional
- what's the value prop
- avoid shorts - people who come from shorts don't stay long and give a bad signal to the algo
- check if more people come from search or other sources, if search is low - don't put too many keywords with high hopes
- look where people drop off from the video and maybe cut out those bad sections

draw on excalidraw

video structure:
- hook (a question) + maybe a few sec of the most interesting part of the video + a very bold/provocative statement
- the hook should meet it in the first 10 sec and even EXCEED them
    - title & thumbnail (T&T) set the expectation
    - first sentence matches the title, first shot matches the thumbnail
    - can use text & arrows/pointers in the first shot to describe the different elements
        - think about hover & preview - have text in the intro of the actual video
    - no need to be 1 for 1, but should be close enough to assure viewers that the T&T weren't clickbait
    - contrast or comparison (current belief/state vs what it should be)
        - current baseline vs contrarian offer - the distance between them is the contrast
        - implied vs stated contrast - either state it explicitly or imply it indirectly ("this is 8x more effective" - baseline being ineffective is implied)
    - 6 words in a hook:
        - subject ("if you/I"), action ("had to grow a YT channel"), objective or end state change ("from 0 to 100k subs"), contrast (objective from current state, "0 to 100k subs"), proof ("again" - I've done it before), time/urgency ("in 5 months", "before EOY")
- 10-30 sec intro after the hook
    - create 1 or more curiosity gaps
        - people should want closure to the open loops created
        - blur things out that will be revealed later
    - provide context
    - introduce stakes/payoff
    - input bias
        - "The Input Bias: The Misuse of Input Information in Judgments of Outcomes"
        - specifically mention how much time & work you've poured into it - the more input - the bias goes - the more value?
        - can show the timeline of the video in the editor
        - also simply the quality of the video speaks for itself as how much input/work went into it
    - show - don't tell - killer intros don't just tell - they show
- find way to incentivise watching till the end - promise to reveal a secret at the end? a big payoff
- there should be causation within the video - not simply going over a list of things, but in a way where item X leads to item X+1
- many people preview the video before clicking on it - first 5 sec should be like the thumbnail, is the hook interesting even without audio? also have captions in the hook, more cuts help in the first 10 sec. Video previews can be turned off in the playback and performance settings.
    - think about the auto captions from YouTube itself and if your captions overlap with those or if they're necessary at all
- frontload stimulus in hook/intro - change visuals every 1.5-2 seconds - more cuts !!!
    - simply zooming in/out counts as cuts & keeps retention
    - before users have committed to viewing the video and entering full screen and ignoring other recommended videos
- focus on the dips where people drop off - fix them for future vids & maybe even cut them out in the editor
- content (value)
    - use plenty of stock footage and graphics - have something change every few (or 10+) seconds - within reason
        - or use movement: slowly (or abruptly) change scale/position (zoom/pan)
        - or add captions - but very selectively! only if emphasis is really required
        - guide the viewer's attention to parts of images - don't simply expect that they'll easily & quickly focus on the most relevant bits
        - animate the most important pieces of text/image/background, or also dim/darken/blur the rest of the screen
        - whenever a graphic comes to the screen - it should be with at least some animation, or use a shutter/pop sound effect
        - think about where the viewer is looking at - don't make him move his eyes too much between cuts - unimmersive
        - breaking visual continuity from time to time is ok
    - problem-solution, problem-solution
        - consistent contrast - multiple side stories - multiple cycles of high/low energy
        - each section with a payoff should have a setup before it and the progress is between the setup & payoff
            - without the right setup or progress the payoff is confusing
    - not just linearly "and, and, and" (disorienting - doesn't specify how one thing is linked to the next)
        - every "and" is a point where the viewer can disengage
        - better: "we tried this, but that got in the way, therefore we had to do this, but it didn't work, so we tried this"
            - seamless flow - immersed from start to finish
    - setup/tension/payoff structure for storytelling - or promise/progress/payoff
        - for each of the 5-10 key points in the video!
        - don't reveal the payoff... until the payoff !!! or there's no tension
    - what intrigues: uncertainty
    - communicate the value of the video better - let viewers know what they'll get out of it
        - viewers must know: what's happening, why it's important, what could go wrong
        - clear & concise isn't good enough - viewers must see it in action - analogy! example!
        - take full advantage of visual communication: always show a visual about what you're talking about
            - picture is worth 1k words, video is worth 1k pictures
    - aim for comprehension
        - don't make viewers feel dumb by sounding too smart - help them close the gap between you & them
        - use simpler words - 6th grade vocabulary
        - repeat the key points
- end on a high note
- outro - end screen sales pitch - no "like/comment/sub" (ask) but redirect to another video (offer) (& discord?)










== thumbnail & title (T&T)
- create 3 and give them to YT to A/B test and pick the best one - you can do multiple successive A/B tests !!!
- less is more
- titles should be clear but don't spoil anything
- most important part of titles should be closer to the start
- set expectations, induce emotion, clear and simple, brighter in color, instantly understandable the concept being conveyed
- face/emotion, only if can convey emotion, and also if I already have an audience and they're familiar with me
- clear text & selective ALL CAPS for emphasis
- elicit an emotion
- needs to induce a curiosity gap & challenge the assumptions of the viewer
    - use a question or get the viewer to ask "what happens next?"
    - the reason to watch should be immediately apparent
- aim for 50 characters
- don't source frames from your video for yout thumbnail - use other sources
- don't put too much - takes more time to process by viewers
- thumbnail checklist (from an analysis of the top youtubers https://prnt.sc/zOB8U8ybNnhq ):
    - main color: black/grey/white/red/orange/blue (either of them)
    - 0-3 words, neutral language
- title checklist:
    - 42 chars average length, 6-7-8 words average, neutral or first person language
    - title case or mixed capitalisation
- power words: emotional/authority/urgency/exclusivity
    https://youtu.be/cF0wTWOQE1s?t=214
    https://prnt.sc/eCkXU2h5TvZc
- monitor CTR (click through rate) & impressions compared to other of you videos and adjust title
- scroll stoppers (so ppl don't just pass your video)
    - nice large round numbers, money, danger & movement, emotion, bright colors, aesthetically pleasing
- thumbnail types: moment/story/result/transformation/novelty
- 3 types of contrast: hue/luminosity/saturation
    - complementary (hue) colors: on the opposite sides of the color wheel
        - triads (3) & tetrads (4) of opposite colors can work too
- think about contrast from all other thumbnails
- preview thumbnail - suggested panel shows the smallest thumbnails
    - CAN YOUR THUMBNAIL STOP THE SCROLL? is it a scroll stopper? if not - needs more work
    https://www.testmythumbnails.com/
- have 3 thumbnails ready - if the video starts to flop after a few hours/days
- rule of thirds - with the 9 parts of the picture - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds
- 5 types of thumbnails for curiosity: moment/story/result/transformation/novelty
- should be able to visually process it in less than 1 second - flash it for 0.5 sec and see if you processed it
- simplicity + exaggeration
- if u confuse - u lose
- don't put anything important on the bottom right of the thumbnail - that's where the video length is displayed


thumbnail idea for future:
- me next to a whiteboard with bullet points & grahps from the video
    https://prnt.sc/-7AaAuNuW2qF

traits of a viral video:
    - videos should have appeal to CCN: core, casual and new audiences
    - unique, novelty
    - easy to convey in packaging - title & thumbnail

all videos in a channel need to adress the same audience !!! everything should be interconnected & relevant
the format should also be consistent... what to do with podcasts & clips from them? :/
channel should support momentum
think of the channel as a TV show
the 80/20 rule: "would 80% of the audience of my last video be interested in my next video?"

don't assume familiarity ("if you know you know") - videos shouldn't assume that viewers are aware of the whole project

the 5 Cs of YT visuals: Content, Clarity, Continuity, Composition, Contrast

annotations & shot list
    if I decide which parts of the script will be with a B-roll with other footage in advance I won't have to read them while looking at the camera
    use a google doc with comments & highlights
    also keep track of setup/tension/payoff for each of the key points in the video - use a table?

capturing attention: novelty, contrast, movement, personal relevance & expectations
hero's journey - answer the following questions:
    - who is the character?
    - what do they want?
    - why can't they get what they want?
    - what are the stakes?
    - who or what helps them?
    - how do they get what they want?
    - how are they transformed by this experience?

principles for persuasion:
    - reciprocity
    - social proof
    - liking
    - authority
    - consistency
    - scarcity

camera shyness:
    - free talking - start talking before the actual lines so u don't start from complete silence

visual style:
    - color palette
        - https://prnt.sc/lblpqxL2lNZs
        - use mostly black, but also red/orange/blue/yellow
        - one color for background (black/red), one for the text & elements (orange/yellow? blue?)
        https://prnt.sc/IjYmXc51n9dG
    - font style associations
        https://prnt.sc/5kyyTJ-LG9GB
        - 3 fonts: text body, header & accent


== editing:
    - J cut & L cut - for abrupt cuts where the audio of the next clip starts earlier or later
    - don't change the focal point too much/drastically - creates visual friction - they have to work to find it - chaotic & hard to follow
        - this happens most often with cut ins & cut outs (zoom in/out) if not towards the face in the shot but the middle
    - consistent color grading - increase brightness, contrast & saturation, adjust white balance
    - use text pop ups to emphasize points & reinforce them
    - text, ovoerlays & motion graphics should share the same font, color palette & animation style
    - the music you choose sets the tone (tense/on edge/excited/energized/hyped/reflective/etc.)
        - sync key moments to the beat
            - for momentum use crescendos, sting, swell, beat drop

- davinci resolve - EQ - can play and boost certain frequencies like the lower ones of my voice
    https://youtu.be/fsBP92yt1Zs?t=518
    To make a voice deeper in DaVinci Resolve, use the Pitch effect in the inspector panel and lower the semitones value to a negative number like \(-5\). For more control, apply the effect to the entire audio track and adjust the value to a subtle negative semitone (e.g., \(-1\) to \(-7\)) for a less extreme effect. You can further enhance the depth by adding EQ to boost low frequencies

carpet on the ground

lighting:
- close curtains - no natural light
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm3jfS78AQg
- 3 lights: key/fill/back - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6W5wbPqzPw
- key (strongest) light from one side, fill (milder) light from the other
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFbiZIsS9vQ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKt0NaMHCbM

- softbox: as big as possible, as close as possible
- softbox: with honeycomb grid - more focused
- key light 45 degree angle to the side
- key light above eye level, camera at eye level
- back/hair/rim light (the same) - on the opposite side of the key light, also a bit higher temperature for the color than the key
- 5600k kelvin == daylight
- CRI rating 95+
- lower ISO == less grain/noise but need more light - aim for 100
- lower aperture / F-stop - for more background blur - aim for 3.5?
    actually high aperture == low value
    - but for pronounced bokeh I need to maximize the aperture, zoom to the longest focal length (200mm), and ensure the background is as far away from the subject as possible
- shutter speed 1/60 if filming with 30fps (should be 2x the fps)
- white balance camera to key light (set it also to 5600k or whatever)
    on white balance:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN8PPLGBZSI
    auto white balance can change during filming which is bad - set it manually
- have a catch light (light reflection from the eye) to feel more alive - perhaps the fill light?

lampi4ki okolo panoto zad men? tube light?

don't put another warm light in the background - instead use the opposite color of the person's face - blue(ish)


what is HDR


- 4:2:2 is preferrable to 4:2:0 if using a green screen or will use a lot of color grading later on, it takes 33% more space (not 50% because the luma (Y) channel is for all pixels)
    https://www.reddit.com/r/cinematography/comments/6e0hrc/comment/di77vb1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button



- 4k over USB is worse than through HDMI
- USB does not transmit audio - but if I use HDMI and I plug the microphone somehow to the recording device then they will be automatically synced
- the hdmi port on laptops is only output - need an adapter from hdmi to usbc adapter (camlink 4k)

buy
- plugin dummy battery
- usbc-usbc cable
- USBC hub
    that supports both Power Delivery and has enough ports

    https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+plug+an+external+USB+microphone+to+iphone+15+pro+max&oq=how+to+plug+an+external+USB+microphone+to+iphone+15+pro+max&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgoIARAAGKIEGIkFMgoIAhAAGKIEGIkFMgoIAxAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBBAAGIAEGKIEMgoIBRAAGIAEGKIE0gEIMzE5OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
- HDMI 4k capture card
    elgato 4k S has audio input and supports HDR, but do I need HDR?
    it does not support 10 bit 4k - only for 1080p
    it does not handle 4:2:2 - only 4:2:0
- hdmi audio embedder (if not part of the capture card)
- USB-C to HDMI adapter or cable and connect the devices


look into the audio interface software

integration
    why/how google failed with their core mission (not just the "don't be evil" one) - integration - and how we'll succeed
    Google's biggest failure LITERALLY nobody is talking about
    a failure so deep nobody has even thought about it
    no - search sucking isn't a sign of their failure - the fact that they didn't change the way information is created and linked on the internet is their failure because that's what it would take to organize the world's information
    the best way to organize information is to change the way it is expressed and created in the first place
    walled gardens of different closed platforms - so even if the entire public web was well organized - still the architecture of the internet would have large private social networks and walled gardens
    mock titles like "that nobody is talking about" & "the real reason Google failed"
    google was NEVER on track to begin with
    Integration - everything that references X - reverse lookup?
    also generalizing something from one industry to another
    Google didnt simply fail - they never even tried
    Google didn't even understand their mission
    Google never had a chance because they didn’t even understand their mission
    as long as when an error is corrected that doesnt trickle down to every single book that's affected - you have NOT organized the world's information
    As long as there is incentive to hoard information you have not organized the world’s information
    they didn't drop the ball - they never picked it up to begin with
