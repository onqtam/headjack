"hey there!" - enter the picture from the side with tilted head first - or start directly with "what is the most important..."


== what makes us special - why the ultimate social system is the great enabler and at the root of everything and why systemic thinking is most important

What is the single most important question for our species? On what does everything we care about depend on? It is how we organize ourselves - our system

What is the most important thing? Something everything good and worth caring for depends on? What is worth dying for? What is the great enabler?
It is the ultimate system
input bias early on - Im the #1 self proclaimed expert on the intersection of … and this is the culmination of the last 4 years of my life - obsession, Im the Architect of The Matrix
So let me tell you why.
We’ll cover collective intelligence and consciousness, incentives, digital ID, culture, causality, the meaning of life, social engineering, and a lot more.
    ... and - ding ding ding! - the meaning of life!
But first - why is our system the most important?

What sits at the absolute root of the causality/dependency graph? What is the essence of our species? The core of civilization?
the root of all root problems once and for all

what should be our ultmate desire? For each and every single one of us? Something worth DYING FOR?

Something so important, so fundamental - that literally everything worth caring for depends on it?

multiple open questions in the hook that gradually get answered in the video:
- what is the ultimate product
- how you can get it

Ultimate desire and how to get it

There isn't a single issue on any scale in the world that wouldn't benefit from a more optimal system for coming up with a solution to it

the product that produces all products.

What should be our ULTIMATE desire?
the ultimate social system.
But WHY?
and why has this been too abstract or intractable for everyone - until now?

the problem: primitive & outdated & (partially) misaligned & wasteful & corrupt & mindless system
Current capitalist system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating
And everything else we've ever tried is even dumber
money got us here but it will not get us there
    the enlightenment and simple liberalism as they were conceived have showed their limits

don't immediately spill the beans that the ultimate product is the ultimate social system
instead say that everything else you get or experience in life depends on it - it is like the water fish swim in and never thing explicitly about
its like the water - we don't see it, we don't question it, or if we do - we feel powerless

ultimate ==> most consequential, most important, most fundamental - second place is not even close

You can’t derive an ought from an is, right? Shame! Discracia! “The Science” could never rebuild trust in the scientific method - it has to happen from the outside. You want trust? EARN IT. Circlejerk of paper citations and grant applications.
Who are you to tell me how to behave and express myself - when was the last time you invented something bigger than money and succeeded on a civilizational scale? Nah - I think stuffing my face with bananas is the way to go in this day and age. I’m pretty confident about that. The more - the merrier! *stuff more bananas* - I don’t care if this is cite-able by academia - I want to recreate and replace academia. I will not denigrate myself to wear a suit and try to signal the old way. *switch to a suit* - how is this better? Sometimes the end justifies the means. If you want Mr. Beast numbers you gotta do Mr. Beast things. People at the UN wear suits… but the UN is a JOKE!!! Shut up and listen - its time to retire the suits.
“Oh wait - did you think the next paradigm would come from someone “respectable” in a suit? Or in the form of a paper or grant from academia?!
    or from some overspecialized reductionist in a lab coat citing his friends, applying for grants, fudging the data and stats to support his thesis, addicting kids to brainrot & food-like poison through science?

With a causal graph we can solve the root of problems once and for all instead of treating their symptoms in a whack-em-all

> "That the truth consists of hard to vary assertions about reality is the most important fact about the physical world." - [David Deutch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=folTvNDL08A&t=973s)

How do we better understand what understanding even is?
Foundational, firm, solid, dependable, necessary
    Everything depends on it and builds on top
    NOPE - not the etymology of "under stand"
understanding is a (directed) representational causal graph where every input and output is relevant and things wouldn't make sence if any of them was missing or different (and the understanding is coherent with and accounts for observations and examples - no contradictions) - ala good explanations are hard to vary and everything in them is necessary

deeper understanding is when you understand the inputs of the inputs (and so forth) of whatever you want to understand

from newton's theory to einstein and how our understanding changed by becoming more specific, more accurate, explaining even more phenomena while retaining most of newtonian physics in less sophisticated problems/domains where its practically indistinguishable
talk about the reach of explanations and how they affect ever more nodes in the causal graph of understanding as they gain more reach
walk through how our causal understanding graph changed with einstein, how a crucial experiment refuted one theory and left only 1 standing as the current best (eddington measuring how light bends around the sun)


When you understand something, you can usually:
- Explain it in your own words
- See relationships, causes, or implications
- Apply it in a new situation
- Recognize why it works the way it does


understanding != knowing
explanation vs mere statement of fact such as a correct description or prediction
"But it is hard to give a precise definition of ‘explanation’ or ‘understanding’. Roughly speaking, they are about ‘why’ rather than ‘what’; about the inner workings of things; about how things really are, not just how they appear to be; about what must be so, rather than what merely happens to be so; about laws of nature rather than rules of thumb. They are also about coherence, elegance and simplicity, as opposed to arbitrariness and complexity, though none of those things is easy to define either." - [The Fabric of Reality, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/177068.The_Fabric_of_Reality)

good explanation == hard to vary == all the parts of it serve a purpose, such that none of them are arbitrary, and if you were to try to change any one of them you would break the explanation
creating knowledge == creating explanations, explaining the world
explanation == an account of why rather than what, an account of what is really out there, not how things appear to be but what must be so


Occam’s razor (My formulation) Do not complicate explanations beyond necessity, because if you do, the unnecessary complications themselves will remain unexplained. - by david


a theory that ‘sticks its neck out’ by being more specific about more phenomena opens up itself and its rivals to more forms of criticism, and therefore has more chance of taking the problem-solving process forward.


Understanding - no fundamental questions unanswered, able to predict phenomenon without contradictions or simply make use of it productively - all relevant phenomena needs an explanation
Intelligibility is a property of the thing, understanding is in the head
Underlying pattern/simplicity capturing the essence, dimensionality reduction, cutting down complexity - how things fit into an intelligible order
Coarse grained, enough for control
Familiarity


we seek explanations that remain robust when we test them against those flickers and shadows, and against each other, and against criteria of logic and reasonableness and everything else we can think of.

## from AIs

A good explanation is a clear, logical, and testable account that details the causes of a phenomenon. It is "hard to vary," meaning its specific details are essential to the explanation and cannot be easily changed without ruining the explanation. Effective explanations are concise, accurate, and tailored to the audience's background knowledge. 
Key Characteristics of a Good Explanation:
- Hard to Vary: Every part of the explanation plays a functional role.
- Testable or Falsifiable: It can be checked against reality to see if it is true.
- Addresses "How" and "Why": It explores causes, effects, and the underlying mechanisms.
- Simple yet Accurate: It accounts for all relevant evidence with the least amount of unnecessary complexity.
- Tailored to the Listener: It connects new ideas to the recipient's prior knowledge. 
Examples and Components:
- Logical Reasoning: A good explanation provides reasons why evidence supports a claim.
- Concrete and Abstract: It balances abstract concepts with concrete examples.
- Non-Circular: It avoids circular reasoning (e.g., explaining that tigers eat meat because they are meat-eaters). 

<!-- understanding is quantified by its (logical consistency) coherence with everything relevant, and depth -->

# coherence
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

coherence = resolution of contradictions
consistency


## from AIs

Coherence is the quality of being logical, consistent, and integrated, where the various parts of a whole fit together in a way that makes sense. Its meaning varies significantly depending on the field: 

In a conceptual sense, coherence is the internal logic that transforms a collection of separate parts into a single, unified "whole."
While consistency means parts don't contradict each other, coherence means they actively support and clarify each other. Think of it through these three conceptual lenses:
The Puzzle Analogy: If you have a pile of random puzzle pieces, they are individual facts. Consistency is ensuring no two pieces are trying to occupy the same space. Coherence is the moment the pieces click together to reveal the intended picture.
The Structural Lens: In any system—whether a legal argument, a software architecture, or a belief system—coherence is the "glue." It is the quality that makes a system resilient; if one part is moved, the logic of the other parts explains why it belongs there.
The "Intelligibility" Factor: Conceptually, coherence is what makes something understandable. Without it, information is just "noise." With it, information becomes "meaning." It bridges the gap between seeing data and understanding a narrative.

Coherence and alignment are often used interchangeably, but they represent distinct, fundamental concepts in strategy, branding, and organizational behavior. Generally, alignment is about the surface-level synchronization of outputs (moving in the same direction), while coherence is the deeper, structural integrity that makes those outputs make sense together.

Here is a breakdown of the differences based on the provided search results:
Key Differences at a Glance
Feature 	Alignment	                Coherence
Focus	    Surface/Output (What)	    Substance/Origin (Why/How)
Nature	    Rigid, "stick to the plan"	Adaptive, context-aware
Driver	    Compliance, consistency	    Trust, shared understanding
Metaphor	Ice (rigid structure)	    Flowing water (directed energy)
Goal	    Being recognized	        Being believed/understood

Detailed Breakdown
- Alignment (Surface & Synchronized): Alignment often implies that all parts of an organization are "standing in line" and executing a rigid, top-down plan. It is concerned with consistency, ensuring that messages or actions look the same across different touchpoints. While necessary for coordination, it can sometimes be fragile or inefficient if forced, leading to a "hollow" feeling.
- Coherence (Substance & Meaning): Coherence is about deep, structural, and logical interconnection. It defines the origin of decisions rather than just the output, providing a unified, trustworthy narrative that makes sense. It allows for autonomy and flexibility within a shared direction.

X can have its own array of what's most relevant to it
    only direct causes?
    X can have multiple different arrays for what's most relevant depending on context
X can be present in the relevance arrays of many other elements
the importance of X from a specific point of view in the causal graph can be calculated by
    - pick a PoV - start from a node of importance (global one: what's most important for our civilization)
    - recursively drill down into every sub-array and find any mentions of X
        - take into account how much importance X plays within each such array
        - total contrib of X == sum(all sub-multiplications)
            something should be multiplied here - think about it later... draw an example matrix with numbers & priorities !!!
    - this leads to a total order of things such as X for this point of view - one singular ordering within one array of everything that contributes to the node we picked as our PoV
we are effectively representing a causal graph with arrays


our destiny is to jail break / take control of the matrix and become its architects

"so you want to escape the matrix? you want out of it? well... YOU CANT! but here's what we can do - we can take control of it and change it"

What if we applied total ordering to a total ordering? We’d get a 2d matrix! And we could go many more levels and dimensions deeper! As deep and recursive as the societal stack can support! One dimension is descriptions of the thing, another is proposals, another is how to even think about this problem and what are the rules of this specific game, etc.

# God & religion
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

we need god - the ultimate - representing the ideal, the telos, the direction, serving as a coordination mechanism for coherence - a schelling point. God generates common knowledge and synchrony and coherence which in turn aid in integration. Authority is necessary/essential - the only questions are if, how, and why it is legitimate. A compass needs a North Pole to work.

the function of religion is to solve a thermodynamic problem - it scales empathy, provides a common worldview and coherence, and a source of authority for coordination - everything else "like an afterlife" was in service to these fundamental goals

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem
Aumann's agreement theorem states that two Bayesian agents with the same prior beliefs cannot "agree to disagree" about the probability of an event if their individual beliefs are common knowledge. In other words, if it is commonly known what each agent believes about some event, and both agents are rational and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule, then their updated (posterior) beliefs must be the same.

# beliefs & epistemology
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

TODO: reword this: How do we form our beliefs of wha is true and false and how do those beliefs distort our perception? When we are born we know nothing about the world and we blindly accept what’s served to us on a plate by our culture. We don’t take epistemology and how we distinguish whats true and false seriously. We dont hold beliefs - they hold us. The greatest source of delusion and inaccurate perception and false beliefs is ourselves. How do we fix our beliefs about our beliefs? All Our beliefs feel true. Most of our beliefs came to us on a first come first serve basis when they feel true and we latch onto them - we didn’t scrutinise them based on evidence, logic and reason. And each new belief is matched against all our previously irrationally adopted beliefs - our criteria for judging new beliefs isn’t truth but how they feel in light of all our other/previous beliefs that we hold. And so epistemic error accumulates and compounds. We build our initial foundational web of beliefs without much conscious thought or questioning. We simply absorb most of our beliefs from our culture. We reject some beliefs if they don’t feel cohesive with our previous ones so that structural integrity is mantained. And most of our beliefs never change and become part of our identity. Our beliefs dictate our actions and behaviour and thus what the world looks like is a direct result of our beliefs. Meta beliefs - beliefs about beliefs - they determine what’s possible or not possible to occur within the web of beliefs itself. If you think you don’t hold beliefs - that’s a meta belief. Or you might think that most of your beliefs are accurate - also a meta belief. Or you might have the belief that you’ve already taken into account all the implications of how beliefs work. We misidentify beliefs as fact. When beliefs lodge themselves in our heads their main “objective” is to remain there. And we manifest our beliefs into the world. We go to war and kill because of our beliefs.

> "An effective accounting of the economy and politics would be a revolutionary act." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=7135)

we invented writing mainly for accounting purposes

accountability etymology
The terms "accountability" and "accounting" share a common root in the Latin word computare, meaning "to calculate".
The term "account" comes from the Old French acontable, meaning "liable to be called to account".
Yes, "accounting" and "accountability" share a common root, both deriving from the Latin word computare, meaning to "reckon" or "calculate". This connection is literal: accountability means the obligation to give an account, and accounting is the system for keeping and presenting those accounts.

double/tripple entry accounting/bookkeeping - revolutions - hypergraph accounting/bookkeeping is next

Outside of proper accounting
Asymmetry
How else do you want me to spell it out for you?!
Un accountable - missing - absence - void - black budget - O!!!

Make accounting sexy again!
Were gonna make accounting sexy again - I said sexy !! Dorky glasses
Use the glasses - first your normal ones and then say "I need more accounting power" & switch to the goody ones and say "1 + 1 = 2"

accountability leads to justice and fairness

Accounting and accountability - its in the word!!!

without credit assignment, without proper accounting - a system cannot learn
when people are shielded from the consequences of their own actions - that's unaccountability - lack of symmetry, lack of skin in the game - and this is true in voting, in media, everywhere

Accounting day is coming!! instead of judgement
> "In an age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill." - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/998039099427704832)
justice breaks without proper accounting
^^ without proper accounting judgement breaks, and if judgement is important for individuals it is also important for collectives
Key concepts (judgement day):
- Accountability: Individuals will be judged for everything they have done, said, and thought, and will be held accountable for their actions.
- God's justice: The event is a demonstration of God's perfect justice and sovereignty, where all wrongs will be righted and all people will be held accountable.

applying/enforcing the golden rule requires proper accounting/evaluation (if something is positive/negative, and what the magnitude is) - The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as you would like to be treated.
https://www.google.com/search?q=the+golden+rule&oq=the+golden+rule
go do what you would hope for - the golden rule is also prescriptive for proactive action, not just about not causing harm
love thy neightbour as thyself
do to others what you would have them do to you

proper accounting requires transparency, openness & alignment of incentives - the only way to generate a trustworthy result

we need to do good instead of appearing to do good - and that's about accounting

congratulations! you found the single most important video on the internet!

We will change the world! Oh - you don't believe me?! LOOK! I have the ENTIRE plan already!

Help me build a better system

Welcome to the end of money

Make no mistake - this is the single most important thing happening in the world - because unlike with AGI/ASI every single idea and concept of this thing already exists - we don't know how to make AGI/ASI (we're in the era of research, right Ilya?) but we do know how to do what I'm talking about

Sounds too good to be true?

we've barely scratched the surface in this video - A LOT was left out

Mic drop at the end - with my tat shown

and that's the end of our family friendly special! BEEP! its not like anyone watching this wouldn't figure out what's beeped out! What a BEEPing joke! We're saving the kids, right?

and I show my face with the thug life glasses

You dont believe me? Watch me. Literally watch me.

feel the *~~AGI~~* collective intelligence / superorganism

all I want is to raise a family, take care of my parents and work on whatever I want
    I like women and knowledge creation & expression - that's all - well also psytrance festivals - no other aspirations or desires - well also kids and a strong community. And I don't think I'm alone, and I think even more people could think this way and join this cultural shift
    I want this to start being developed, I want direct access to the people I've learned from until now - make this viral
    I will show you another world and deliver us from evil
    I want to make new connections and to justify them as best as I can and to hand them off to the collective
    I want as much money just to not have to think about boring mundane shit and to just work
        I don't want to wait for black friday deals, to research the cheapest lights, learn how to edit, how to soundproof a room - all I want is to work on the book and dissipating its ideas

eventually I'll publish even my carbon & plastic consumption, my travel

upsides vs downsides of video & book

lets build the kingdom of god/heaven
