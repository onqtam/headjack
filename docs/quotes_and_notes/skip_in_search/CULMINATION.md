input bias early on




== what makes us special - why the ultimate social system is the great enabler and at the root of everything and why systemic thinking is most important





What is the most important thing? Something everything good and worth caring for depends on? What is worth dying for? What is the great enabler?
It is the ultimate system
Im the #1 self proclaimed expert on the intersection of … and this is the culmination of the last 4 years of my life - obsession
So let me tell you why.
We’ll cover collective intelligence and consciousness, incentives, digital ID, culture, causality, the meaning of life, social engineering, and a lot more.
    ... and - ding ding ding! - the meaning of life!
But first - why is our system the most important?

What sits at the absolute root of the causality/dependency graph? What is the essence of our species? The core of civilization?

what should be our ultmate desire? For each and every single one of us? Something worth DYING FOR?

Something so important, so fundamental - that literally everything worth caring for depends on it?




we fail at identifying and prioritising what's most important and relevant

moving from adversarial zero-sum dynamics to synergistic positive-sum
nonzero - part of evarrow


decouple resources for personal use from control over the economy
prestige

externalities


== the stakes
- the future of life on earth depends on this - a crossroads between the 2 types of digital identity





social engineering - our sociality is what's most important about our species - how our interaction is structured is foundational
its been happening since forever
5th generation warfare has been raging on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare
World War 3 is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation. (Marshall McLuhan, 1970, Culture Is Our Business)

> "we are cooperators that are made of cooperators that are made of cooperators and so on. It is cooperation all the way down." - [source](https://www.evolutionarymanifesto.com/EvArrowBook.pdf)

multiple open questions in the hook that gradually get answered in the video:
- what is the ultimate product
- how you can get it

Ultimate desire and how to get it

There isn't a single issue on any scale in the world that wouldn't benefit from a more optimal system for coming up with a solution to it
- Every problem would benefit from integration

the product that produces all products.

What should be our ULTIMATE desire?
the ultimate social system.
But WHY?
and why has this been too abstract or intractable for everyone - until now?

the problem: primitive & outdated & (partially) misaligned & wasteful & corrupt & mindless system
Current capitalist system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating
And everything else we've ever tried is even dumber
money got us here but it will not get us there

don't immediately spill the beans that the ultimate product is the ultimate social system
instead say that everything else you get or experience in life depends on it - it is like the water fish swim in and never thing explicitly about
its like the water - we don't see it, we don't question it, or if we do - we feel powerless

aggregate expression

somehow tie in the golden rule - The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as you would like to be treated.
https://www.google.com/search?q=the+golden+rule&oq=the+golden+rule
go do what you would hope for - the golden rule is also prescriptive for proactive action, not just about not causing harm
love thy neightbour as thyself
do to others what you would have them do to you

ultimate ==> most consequential, most important, most fundamental - second place is not even close

The future belongs to those who can predict it and that’s why we should incentivise them to share their predictions openly with skin in the game and contribute to our commons
predictive commons


global shared world model
a Worldwide collective Self Model

fundamentally uncensorable
will replace email, 
every single internet service in existence today will eventually migrate & merge with this architecture or fade into irrelevance

the infinite game
    To desire the ultimate social system means wanting a form of collective organization that perfectly harmonizes individual and collective flourishing — a system that:
        Fulfills all material and psychological needs,
        Maximizes freedom and creativity,
        Minimizes suffering and conflict, and
        Sustains itself and the planet indefinitely.
    It’s a desire for the ideal environment in which human (and perhaps non-human) potential can fully unfold.
    The ultimate social system is the most general enabler of all other desires.

Syntropy
    A tendency towards complexity, structure, order, and organization of ever more advantageous and orderly patterns. Originally coined as a synonym for negentropy (the opposite of entropy)
    often contrasted with the concept of entropy


once you find/understand it you'll never think about anything else more than about this thing

I’ve been sitting on
I don’t want to try
I want to succeed
Those who tell the stories rule the world
Theoretically optimal solution - no other design can get even close to the optimal set of technical tradeoffs in my architecture
The more compelling and refined the story becomes - the sooner will the system reach a billion people
> "Those who tell the stories rule society." - [Plato](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20382-those-who-tell-the-stories-rule-society)

Nervous system

> "An effective accounting of the economy and politics would be a revolutionary act." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=7136)

we invented writing mainly for accounting purposes

reread the paper from francis about alignment & self-organization in communicating groups?

> "Your margin is my opportunity." - [Jeff Bezos](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/706779-your-margin-is-my-opportunity)
Your conspicuous consumption is our opportunity


we need an ideal towards which to strive towards - as a society, and as males and females

if we have a weighted causality graph and we have goals - we also have a morality structure - we can assign valence to any single thing that's part of that causality graph
is it easy or straightforward to create this graph? Heck no! but the sooner we start working on our process - the sooner we'd have something better than what we have now
With a causal graph we can solve the root of problems once and for all instead of treating their symptoms in a whack-em-all

social copying, veblen goods, mimetic desire - we want what others want

Meaning comes from being consequential

Multiscale competency architecture
Subsidiarity
Hierarchy

The upstream of the upstream

Status dominance prestige
Status and prestige are in our dna

Where is the global handle/knob/lever on parameter X?

There is a way to own nothing and be happy

Differentiation and specialization coupled with alignment and integration

Put your favourite pictures in the video

This is the real situational assessment
^^ this fails by assuming familiarity ("if you know you know")

hearts and minds

anything that's altruistic needs to be rewarded (making it no longer altruistic)
sharing is synergetic - it is more efficient for the whole

Aggregation

We haven’t scratched the surface of the potential of enculturation

a new game the likes of which we could have never even conceived


no ceiling for personal consumption
the status game has no limits in resource use

intro: this video is the culmination of 4 years of work

something larger than ourselves that will persist beyond our lives

- internet 2.0
- fundamental upgrade to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and cognize/think together - collective cognition
- works on any scale - all the way up to the global level - the same stack works on global/national/city/party/company level
- what would the best possible system we could come up with look like?
- the ultimate product/service is the ultimate social system and we're going to co-discover it
- what is the ultimate product/service? it is the ultimate social system.
- and what is better than a product that spreads by word of mouth? an ideology behind a product that spreads by word of mouth
- A protocol - fundamentally open and uncensorable with strong user privacy
    Total privacy for individuals and complete transparency for organizations
- A reversed panopticon
- Ladder of influence and legitimacy (legibility?)
- Opt-in
- Can scale to tens of billions and has no limitations on the amount of data
- True anonymity with zero knowledge - can even prove to be a real human and prove credentials in a privacy preserving way 
- Self organization
- this system is inevtable if it starts getting going
- Voting on rules of the game & specific issues - not parties and individuals - subjective objectivity
- Bottom up emergent regulation
- Architecture for cultural evolution
- The loss function of a hive mind
- A new incentive architecture that will eventually rival and regulate money itself
- Identity, reputation
- Our focus should be on mechanism design
- Social credit system
- Collective intelligence & aggregating creativity
- intelligence is always a distributed system - dofferentiation & integration & alignment - the whole more than the sum of the parts
- The ultimate meta system that can solve any problem
- Social operating system multi century old
- Language/writing/printing press
- An economy around solving real problems
- changing property - and no, this isn't simply socialism or communism
- A new form of accounting for contribution and redistributing resources
- The fusion of state/market/academia/media/religion/education
- Reinventing governance and adding market discipline
- Solving alignment for people
- Final major evolutionary transition
- Atick around if you want to be early in the final battle between good and evil
- Digital id can go horribly/terribly wrong & orwellian or incredibly right
- The most flexible and scalable architecture for the evolution of culture and incentives
- Our system fails at conveying why we should care about others
    - why the wellbeing of others is in your best (expanded) self interest
    - Why others matter to us
    System fails at prioritisation which depends on accounting of contribution and causal links
    Its time to start adressing the root of all problems instead of symptoms
- Program or be programmed
- As batman said… digital id is an inevitability
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system

The most important developments this century are AI & CI

collective intelligence - If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Thrives

System fails at communicating why and how to care for others
convincingly

We have all the pieces if the puzzle because of the great unbundling - all we need to do is the great integration

frame control & manipulation

the best nationalism is one that seeks to cooperate with others

Permanent record, but for those with the most influence

meritocracy

built-in error correction as the highest priority

engineered scarcity

New motivation/mobilization system

Self justifying

Prestige

Choose life

Regulating and steering desire and consumption through culture - redefining status

Sensemaking


Open society

Deep democracy
1 man 1 vote only on the base constitution which defines the inequality in the other layers

What should we be coherent around and what not, and how do we determine the boundry and also truth

No single person or group in the entire world has thought as much as me about the intersection of …
^^ early in the clip


perfect? no! better? yes!

People are just brought up into existence with an empty script of "go through school and get a job"
We need a hitchhikers guide to conscious existence

Just because something is legal and makes money does not automatically make it ok

Wherever there’s a capacity for choice - there are better and worse options. We need people to understand that this applies to everything and we need a theory of progress and of what is good and we need people to want to make the better choice and to inform themselves about it and how it was derived and how to improve the system that derived it
We might be wrong but thats just an opportunity for error correction - the need is still there even if its currently wrong
This includes even every aspect of how we raise kids

How do we achieve mass self-actualization?
To be, to contribute, to be recognized? And appreciated and loved?

Education doesn’t end with school

Value coding society


Later on:
But is there an MVP or a demo you BBC can try? Why not?
…
And in fact this is the architecture in which we’ll co-create our story

Cultural enlightenment or bust
Protopia or bust
Showing the video with daniel & brett
& a petri dish bust graphic

We’re gonna make “ought” great again

We did not evolve for such a complex society - we either build the systems to scaffold our capacity upward or we perish
We are the most basic form of general intelligence - the lower bound

An open and integrated system is one in which every problem has to be solved just once and reused

What is the best argument for what makes a good argument?
    Argument ==> explanation
How do we better understand what understanding is?
What is the best way to determine what is best?
What is the best incentive structure to improve the incentive structure?
How do we make common knowledge what common knowledge is and why it is important for coordination?
How do we innovate on how we innovate such that we don't cause even bigger problems down the road when we solve problems? How do we better factor (account for) all externalities and foresee a few steps out - a few levels of indirection and not just the immediate stuff?
    how do we better innovate in how we innovate, such that we don't cause bigger problems down the road when we solve problems now? how do we factor in all externalities and 2nd & 3rd order effects?
How do we better educate as many people as possible about the logic of better educating as many people as possible? (as best as possible)
    How do we better educate as many people as possible about the logic of this system that would scale and improve this education?
How do we best identify what is worth identifying?
    ^^ this isnt that good/recursive
Vote on how to vote on everything else
we will judge how to judge
How do we get people more interested in being more interested & interesting?
we need to be on the same page & coherent on what we need to be on the same page & coherent and how we determine where the boundry is
Moje bi trqbva da e “how do we get on the same page on/about what/how/why we should be on the same page on/about?”


How do we shortcut the young into competence and engagement with the real economy instead of made up useless and meaningless hoop-jumping tasks?

Retarding the youth for profit is a crime against humanity on the grandest of scales

How do we cultivate a better culture

Authority and legitimacy

What are the most fundamental aspects of pur reality? No, i don’t mean quantum mechanics or some shit like that - i mean of immediate practical utility for everyone

A new form of collective expressivity

We need to suck creativity out of our culture and feed it back in
The culture that we cultuvate

Where life has reached is extraordinary

We are here to put a dent in the universe

The fact that we still kill each other is absurd
The universe is literally ours - all we have to do is simply not squander it

Who are we, what are we, why are we here?
“WHY ARE WE HERE?”
Stare into the camera
We can engineer scarcity
We can direct desire
What are we?
What is experience itself?
What are we as a species?
What is our role in the universe?

We are all going to - probably - die
And what do we want to tell the future generations about our current capacity for dreaming and imagination and creativity and values and aspirations


Life births the concept and need for meaning
To a stale and more monotonous universe
We are the universe looking at itself

We are the most important thing in the universe

Make the case for life’s struggle evolutionarily to stat away from equilibrium
To be something against the monotony of space and time


Structure of organization & the universe

Those who tell the stories rule the world
We can invent something bigger than money itself

What are we and what our place in the universe is

“The (collective) reward function”

We need to replace charisma with competence

Coherence about how and about what to have coherence about

There is such a thing as raising kids optimally

We need to reward truth more than anything else

this is not capitalism, not communism or socialism or fascism or anarchism or any kind of ism or shism we've ever had - this is something new! like entirely new! like ... it didn't exist before! like ... a synthesis of everything we've learned and we're pushing forward! We can have new things, you know...

alignment & accountability on the record ==> end hypocrisy

> "If doing the right thing is the wrong thing, there’s something fundamentally wrong with the system." - [Jim Rutt](https://youtu.be/RkhZfDXkX74?t=2602)
1 party lying against the other
cutting costs
externalities
multipolar traps
4 year cycles of back-and-forth erosion of what the others were doing - like a seesaw alternating between 2 poles
    Duverger's law
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law
Prisonners dilemma
tragedies of the commons
Now this is really dangerous for our democracy

We need a simplification of our system in a way that translates across scales
Talk about the isomorphic patterns


Adjudication


Knowledge fractal - zoom in on any aspect of it as much as you want

Sunlight is the best disinfectant


We need to replace rhetoric with provable competence and skin in the game

“And how do u find/get it?”

A seamless game-like interface to the whole economy

The reward function

Everyone should understand as much as possible of the most important aspects of how and why society functions - and this sounds incredibly obvious and yet our current system is nowhere close to actually aiming towards that
In order to maintain, debug and improve it
We should be aiming at making everyone as useful and thriving as possible
Captain Obvious strikes again! (And I hit a piece of paper with my notebook like a baseball)
This is the value of others

every problem would benefit from more integration, more feedback (anyone can chime in) and a ability to filter those opinions in flexible & creative ways for signal

This system will absorb humanity’s wealth through donation and seduction - fundamentally non violent

The only way to deal with the ever increasing complexity is through compression and better explanations and incentives


We need to aim the system at developing people

The dick measuring contest has no upper limit
Show yachts - ask if they've offset the carbon emissions for the production and maintenance and operation of them
We either put a cap on the dick measuring contest or it will cap humanity’s runway

Is this communism?
> "Good ideology. Wrong species." - [E. O. Wilson on Marxism](https://paulgraham.com/quo.html#:~:text=%22Good%20ideology.%20Wrong%20species.%22%0A%0A%E2%80%93%20E.%20O.%20Wilson%20on%20Marxism)
stop it! stop thinking of just capitalism and communism or socialism! The state space is not even just the continuum between them - the design space is vast and multidimensional!
morpheus - free your mind!
more capitalistic than capitalism & more socialistic/communistic than socialism/communism
"yeah but it still sounds like communism!"
STOP IT!
and no, it's not about "tAx ThE RICh" - it's about socially engineering the rich/elite! (and everyone else)

if it turns out a single individual can outperform any form of collective intelligence and governance and can revolutionize multiple industries in the trillions - so be it! I WELCOME single individuals commanding tens of trillions of capital for the benefit of all - as long as they've earned it through competence and alignment and that there are accountability measures in place.


The real hunger games is about who can provide the most nutritious food to as many people as possible

Explain how a new parallel economy will form and outcompete and swallow the current one along with incentives to join it and tarriffs

What is a multipolar trap
Tragedy of the commons
The greatest multipolar trap is about how much we personally consume

This is what real progressivism looks like

how do we generate the best possible answers and explanations to as many important questions and problems as possible? and share them as widely as possible? make them as accessible as possible? How do we incentivise their dissemination as wide as possible?
How do we rank and sort and prioritize things?

A sane society/civilization would be actively striving to lift as much people as possible out of poverty and to educate them and harness their creativity and intelligence for synergistic problem solving for all

Money got us here, but it will not get us there

It aint easy to bootstrap a network effect and reach billions and
Nobody has ever made something bigger than money

We need to reinvent how we do debate in the digital age - in a structured and explicit way

There absolutely are ways of redistributing wealth in a way that doesn’t make the receivers ungrateful and lazy and entitled - we just havent figured out how to do it yet
And also how to compensate those that generate the extra surplus that doesn’t go all to them and have them be not simply willing but genuinely eager to participate in something greater than themselves
instead of redistributing which requires taking which feels less pleasant than gaining feels pleasant - what if people didn't accumulate that much resources for personal consumption in the first place? what if they were compensated in different ways?
what if there was a system that actually deserved your taxes / fair share, one which is more efficient even than markets as they exist today? people don't want to get taxed not only because they want more for themselves, but also because governments are the biggest wasters in the world
loss aversion - loss hurts like a BEEP

we (this new system) don't want to be voted into government - we don't need it - we'll simply make an alternative that people will eventually flock to - one which delivers the goods and outperforms the current system on EVERY SINGLE METRIC worth outperforming
This system will wipe the floor with any other - nothing will be able to compete and every competing power structure will join in their best  newly understood and deeper self interest - not out of fear but through a combination of seduction, shame, and consensual indoctrination

and hey - I'll practice what I preach - I'll be the first to opt-in to this system and I will not be a billionaire or eventually a trillionaire, I'll consume according to the personal curve and I'll strive to steer as much cultural and economic capital as I deserve and have earned - according to the second curve - and all of that accounting will happen on this reputational system - the new arena
one of the twitch founders initially live-streamed his whole life 24/7 and that was the entire website - his personal livestream, I will live-report my spending and ownership in a completely transparent way in this new property regime

Dont you get it - alignment is the fundamental problem
Align or die

Google what is at the root of all evil
Unaccountability is at the root of all evil - not money or profit (although the fact that gold has no smell is problematic)
Outside of proper accounting
Asymmetry
How else do you want me to spell it out for you?!
Un accountable - missing - absence - void - black budget - O!!!

Make accounting sexy again!
Use the glasses

accountability leads to justice and fairness

Lift heavy shit to mock lifting and fall to the side
Say that the olympics are great nonetheless - they’re great fun actually

This guy (jesus - the cross) was onto something - he’s got a point

We need to disintegrate this beurocratic spaghetti

Make fun of someone not petting others copy during exam

The olympics are from an era when strength mattered (stronk!!1) - what should the olympics of modernity and digital society be?
put that big rock down bro, its the 21st century, we no longer compete on lifting heavy shit

fractal total order
look at this fucking shit - mandelbrot set - it keeps on going!

Im batman - impression
Photo of me with toilet paper on my head with holes

Accounting and accountability - its in the word!!!

without credit assignment, without proper accounting - a system cannot learn
when people are shielded from the consequences of their own actions - that's unaccountability - lack of symmetry, lack of skin in the game - and this is true in voting, in media, everywhere

inherently uncooptable/incorruptible - self-correction is built-in and it cannot be ripped out!

We need to engineer our society

Im a public servant - not a private individual - and im not calling for everyone to be as extreme as me, but I want to 

no longer 1 man 1 vote
Popper quote we are all equal in our infinite ignorance
we will have equality in our vote only about the inequality of our vote

Its all about public goods

Infinity is ours - all we have to do is not fuck it up!
Infinity is on the event horizon of existence - the question is do we want it badly enough


have a shot of me with tin foil - not just a hat but my entire head with a hole to breathe - we need a system in which we wouldn't need a CIA - in the very far future

Its the most obvious thing what we should be doing as a species and yet it needs to be said

The largest tax fraud in physical existence / space and time

Why is it all confusing/bad? or what is the highest leverage point?
Its the paradigm stupid!
Gold has no smell, property
Identity & transparency

How DUMB as a species are we

You can’t separate is from ought

Its the paradigm, stupid!

Its just a fucking horse! about when we designed representative democracy and capitalism

Consumption beyond a certain level simply is immoral



The meta solution to all of our problems is an incentive architecture for truth to reliably bubble up to the top
Ruthlessly incentivising truth

we need to optimize the means of production and steer the desires of consumption - but not through legislation but through cultural regulation (not wokery)

we need to recognize culture for what it is - the next substrate of evolution - the ether that binds us

Those who can predict the future
The extent to which those predictions are shared is the extent to which the future will be shared



PROPERTY! That thing which we fight for
Not emotional but effective redistribution
and instead of simply taxing and taking we should be giving something in return for that surplus - in the current paradigm taxing one's wealth diminishes his power and influence, but we can have a different contract for personal wealth and still allow individuals to garner as much influence over the economy as they deserve, + other forms of prestige & engineered scarcity
liquidity, fungibility
Democratically programmable currency, the end of fungibility


fallibilism


Ev has direction
- greater scales of differentiation, (thermodynamic) integration & cooperation
- greater evolvability
- greater ability to model and predict reality
the most fundamental logic and forces in nature point towards thermodynamic integration and cooperation

The Grandest Narrative
The Next Game

The Hard Problem of Consciousness is how to deepen it for everyone at scale and how to engineer it collectively

Identity is bigger/deeper than money itself

incentives/identity - it doesn't get any deeper or more fundamental than that

> "How does society work? Five words or less: Behavior is determined by incentives... The particular arrangement of incentives across time, space, and causality is called an incentive structure.
>
> ... What about free will? It’s the ability to respond to our incentives. Being a good person? It’s having an incentive to behave in ways we call “good”—that is, wanting to win the virtue game... Let’s give this worldview a name. Let’s call it incentive determinism. Incentive determinism is obvious. It’s just a bunch of tautologies: we are who we are, we want what we want, and we do what we’re caused to do. And yet, barely anybody thinks this way. It’s a cold, alien way of thinking... We spend very little time discussing which incentive structures are the best, and tons of time talking about which sets of words are the right words and which sets of people are the right people. It’s why we write words at all: we think we’re the right people with the right words, and if we just say those words loudly enough, we’ll improve the world.
>
> ... People don’t like incentive determinism because it’s disorienting. It tells us that our single greatest obsession, likability, is a distraction. It’s bullshit—a destroyer of insight, an enemy of understanding. It plays no special role in explaining how the world works. All it does is give us the illusion of understanding—the feeling of superiority to our apparently unlikable rivals (another big incentive for us)—while leaving us in ignorance of the causal structure of the world.
>
> And that causal structure is everything. If there are powerful incentives to help others, then even “evil” people will help others. If there are powerful incentives to hurt others, then even “good” people will hurt others. In fact, if being a “good” person just means being strongly incentivized by others’ moral approval (i.e., really wanting to win the virtue game), then good people are more likely to hurt people when it wins them moral approval. The “good” members of ISIS are the ones who bravely volunteer to commit suicide bombings, and the “bad” members of ISIS are the ones who cravenly fail to make the ultimate sacrifice. People are only as good as their incentives.
>
> But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe figuring out how this all works—understanding the machinery of society—can, itself, change our incentive structures. Insight is a thing in the world that human primates evolved to want, at least sometimes.
>
> If there’s any hope to be found in this cold, alien view of the world, it’s this: the more we all become aware of our incentive structures, the more incentivized we will be to choose them wisely... If we're collectively aware of our incentive structures, and aware that others know that we're aware, then we have an incentive to pick one that makes everyone better off, so that people won't judge us as selfish. So the key is achieving widespread awareness, or common knowledge, of our incentive structures... we're trying to explain the part of reality that is not random. That is all we can do. And when we look at that part, incentives are everything.
>
> ... I don't see incentive determinism as a "theory" so much as a different way of thinking, or a useful conceptual framework. It's honestly just a way of activating a different part of the brain--the tool-use part--to understand society as a machine of moving parts. It's more of a metatheory, really, or a useful way of coming up with other theories. It can give rise to more specific theories about the incentive structures we face, and how they work, which can then be tested. Insofar as the theories it gives rise to are always false, then, sure, it's false. But given that incentive-based thinking lies at the heart of economics and much of social science (not to mention evolutionary biology), it seems like a pretty damn good metatheory and I don't know of a better one. I cannot even conceive a better one, to be honest." - [Incentives Are Everything, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/incentives-are-everything)

The most important thing? Education? Close! But incentives are even deeper in the causal graph of civilization

we need incentives to stay consistent and not to be able to rewrite history and your opinions

initially this will get bootstrapped on the internet as self-governance around some non-political issuebut once its been proven to work and all the kinks have been ironed out and people have become accustomed to it - it will start spreading to other areas with increasingly more consequence in the real world.


We will engineer money the likes of which you couldnt imagine

Fine tuning every single aspect of society democratically

The end of 1 man 1 vote - democratic inequality of influence, we all get an equal vote about what else to not have an equal vote on
slaughter of sacred cows

Intitially a parallel system - will not need to be voted in politically to start having effect

We have not even begun to explore the potential of enculturation in a conscious and intentional/deliverate and democratic way

Welcome to the final battle between good & evil - the trajectory of everything in this part of the galaxy that’s beautiful is at stake

Im not going to be a trillionaire (i totally could - especially in a fiat world - or just show the dollar bill graph going to 0) or even a billionaire - i think the most important, successful and consequential people who have contributed the most don’t need and deserve more than a few million (single digit) of wealth for personal consumption and to raise their families - we need to put a ceiling on the conspicuous consumption rat race

How do we get the young - and the middle aged! - to play the game of civilization instead of grinding on a meaningless shadow career - how do we mobilize the disenfranchised?
How do we move away from gatekeeping credentialism to competencialism?

Cultural operating system

Not a specific one size gits all solution but a universal incentive architecture for optimal cultural evolution, competition & cooperation that can branch and fork and merge
Am i proposing a specific set of weights set in stone? NO! Thats the beauty of it! We’ll determine those weights democratically and evolve them

We need the olympic games of problem identification and solutions ranked by consequentiality and morality

Will money try to corrupt this system? Of course! But the highest status will be reserved to those that find such cases - those that get us closer to truth


Krishnamurty inner poverty quote

Sam altman doing it not for money clip

You’ll own little and be happy - especially for the elite

When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail - all we have is money and markets (for now)

We can extract the essence of capitalism - incentives, skin in the game, creative destruction, control

We can disentangle (or at least change the relationship between) personal wealth from the incentives and control in the economy


Consciousness is a process that happens to information - a product of information flow
Nikolay kukushkin

this is the great reset - where wealth is re-evaluated and re-accounted for - gradually - it will take 2 to 3 generations for the majority of humanity to fully migrate - but it will happen before the end of this century

At the core of intelligent systems is their capacity for relevance realization - to pay attention to relevant stimuli & memories and to manifess the most relevant behavioral response

CC
The degree to which we implement CC is the degree to which we are aligned and optimally self-organizing
We need a system that systematically identifies altruistic endeavors and rewards them accordingly to their impact
The degree to which we exploit synergy is the degree to which we shall prosper

A new kind of Self-Correcting Authority

we can pass The Great Filter

We need a system that reliably generates better explanations and better strategies of putting them in people’s heads

Life is the opposite of the physical monotony of physical space, matter, and time - life is agency despite all osds

We need to get as much people as possible to be as capable and motivated as possible to be solving as big of collective problems as possible
We must change and steer the flows of attention, motivation and value
We must become conscious and self-reflective as a society

Metaverse - bridging/extending the real world with the virtual - virtualizing the real world

despite Goodhart's Law - this will be a system that is constantly self-correcting its reward mechanism - whatever it is - always error-correcting - in pursuit of error


The elite of the future has to consume less and provide more - its our job to figure out the most optimal incentive architecture thats’s better than money and private property as they are conceived today

The open transparency network/overlay of society
Transparency as a service

No more frame control, no more double standards

Its time to look at the most fundamental structural issues - and that is status


Crowdsourcing the replacement of capitalism & democracy

We need to direct youtube
Youtube is the unconscious way of designing how we surface signal and direct attention
We need to infuse youtube with morality
Redefining the attention economy

How do we better bet on others? Surface signal? And be rewarded? What is the prediction market for people?

Fame as a service
we can reinvent/re-engineer status and fame

Shared culture as a service

A system that deserves its taxes - where you pay because you want to help as much as possible - what do u want to be replaced by?

More capitalistic than capitalism and more socialistic than socialism

A real theory of progress

How do we design the system such that it produces the greatest truth? As a package? As a bible? As a self-modifying and improving (with a diff and notifications for changes to the different aspects and parameters)

Desire as a service

Lets co-create our collective mind virus
Mind virus as a service


The nation that adopts this system/paradigm first will inherit the earth the first


Is interest rate a fundamental parameter? No! Its the paradigm, stupid!


How and why to help the most other people


We can answer every question as best as possible - including what is moral, how to be a man and how to be a woman? How to be a human being? What is positive and what is negative?

The largest and most competent intentional community

Incentives and valence shall permeate/penetrate

This is the system that the young should build for themselves
Intergenerational transmission not only of knowledge but also of opportunity
Universal basic opportunity

Universal basic humble pie - full accounting of your votes and decisions

Do we want to collectively incubate a whole cohort of human potential and creativity by redirecting surplus their way in the name of something greater than ourselves?

The answer is not 42 - it is having children. Creating what you want to be replaced by.
Biological children. Cultural children - both one-to-many and one-to-one
The ability to upload yourself is not about our conscious experience but about the continuity of our identity and soul

Startup civilization

In the next few years we will explore every single aspect of this system and its potentialities

The real virtue signal

What is our great replacement theory? What do we want to leave after we’re gone? What kind of world? What kind of people? What kind of ideas? What kind of art?

We need to apply RR collectively at scale

Month by month we will co-create the next world religion

What if we started pattern matching our best ideas together? How do we optimally let ideas have sex? How do we create the large idea collider?

You need a theory of progress and a causality map in order to implement the comparison operator

how do we have power without corruption?

society as an organism - from fascism - and yet we speak of organs of society - institutions - educational system, government, economy, religion, legal system
institutions: rules, roles & enforcement of those rules that structure human interaction - including habits, practices & values
examples: markets, marriage, corporations, legal system (also specific courts as specific sub-institution), journalism, higher education, regulatory bodies, etc. - organizations are specific instantiations of institutions
they structure relationships to avoid conflict, avoid opportunistic behavior, etc.
