"hey there!" - enter the picture from the side with tilted head first - or start directly with "what is the most important..."


== what makes us special - why the ultimate social system is the great enabler and at the root of everything and why systemic thinking is most important

What is the single most important question for our species? On what does everything we care about depend on? It is how we organize ourselves - our system

What is the most important thing? Something everything good and worth caring for depends on? What is worth dying for? What is the great enabler?
It is the ultimate system
input bias early on - Im the #1 self proclaimed expert on the intersection of … and this is the culmination of the last 4 years of my life - obsession, Im the Architect of The Matrix
So let me tell you why.
We’ll cover collective intelligence and consciousness, incentives, digital ID, culture, causality, the meaning of life, social engineering, and a lot more.
    ... and - ding ding ding! - the meaning of life!
But first - why is our system the most important?

What sits at the absolute root of the causality/dependency graph? What is the essence of our species? The core of civilization?
the root of all root problems once and for all

what should be our ultmate desire? For each and every single one of us? Something worth DYING FOR?

Something so important, so fundamental - that literally everything worth caring for depends on it?

multiple open questions in the hook that gradually get answered in the video:
- what is the ultimate product
- how you can get it

Ultimate desire and how to get it

There isn't a single issue on any scale in the world that wouldn't benefit from a more optimal system for coming up with a solution to it

the product that produces all products.

What should be our ULTIMATE desire?
the ultimate social system.
But WHY?
and why has this been too abstract or intractable for everyone - until now?

the problem: primitive & outdated & (partially) misaligned & wasteful & corrupt & mindless system
Current capitalist system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating
And everything else we've ever tried is even dumber
money got us here but it will not get us there
    the enlightenment and simple liberalism as they were conceived have showed their limits

don't immediately spill the beans that the ultimate product is the ultimate social system
instead say that everything else you get or experience in life depends on it - it is like the water fish swim in and never thing explicitly about
its like the water - we don't see it, we don't question it, or if we do - we feel powerless

ultimate ==> most consequential, most important, most fundamental - second place is not even close

Elephant sucking itself - start eating one of the bananas
And start talking to the camera with a full mouth - if you’re a scientist and think all of this is excessive and profane and distasteful - look in the mirror. Look at you - all high minded in your ivory tower. “The Science” as an institution has completely lost the mandate of heaven - its completely impotent and subservient to a broken system which twists and biases it in return. You’re coopted. You lack integrity. Unreplicatable. Fraught with fraud. You’re pumping out PhDs and self-referential papers. Your metric has been gamed. You’ve over-reliant on reductionism. You’re impotent - both in influence and in your ability to communicate yourself to the public. Shout out to all the psychologists at facebook and all the food engineers making addictive junk - now there’s what I call very fine people on both sides! Perfectly legal, right? You can’t derive an ought from an is, right? Shame! Discracia! “The Science” could never rebuild trust in the scientific method - it has to happen from the outside. You want trust? EARN IT. Circlejerk of paper citations and grant applications.
Who are you to tell me how to behave and express myself - when was the last time you invented something bigger than money and succeeded on a civilizational scale? Nah - I think stuffing my face with bananas is the way to go in this day and age. I’m pretty confident about that. The more - the merrier! *stuff more bananas* - I don’t care if this is cite-able by academia - I want to recreate and replace academia. I will not denigrate myself to wear a suit and try to signal the old way. *switch to a suit* - how is this better? Sometimes the end justifies the means. If you want Mr. Beast numbers you gotta do Mr. Beast things. People at the UN wear suits… but the UN is a JOKE!!! Shut up and listen - its time to retire the suits.
“Oh wait - did you think the next paradigm would come from someone “respectable” in a suit? Or in the form of a paper or grant from academia?!
    or from some overspecialized reductionist in a lab coat citing his friends, applying for grants, fudging the data and stats to support his thesis, addicting kids to brainrot & food-like poison through science?
    Or from some prophet? Sorry to disappoint - this is the mr beast era - wake the fuck up. Or did you expect a revelation on mt. Sinai? Oh wait that happened )) - I'm kind of a prophet myself - it says 1 word - README!
    Or did you expect some kind of (bearded) prophet on mount Sinai with a stone tablet from God?! **and roleplay it before showing the photo** - FINE - here you go - happy now?

Oops you just caught me maximizing my utilitarian happiness
I’m not trying to appeal to those that have already rendered themselves subservient to the system - I’m appealing to the young who are neuroplastic and have nothing to lose but everything to gain. I’m appealing to the only future of humanity - the next generation. Build and reconceptualize your future because if you don’t - nobody else will. You need to create your own new status hierarchy and attention economy and reshape culture - literally everything else will follow from that. Someone needs to run the system - you will inherit it, but you can build the future regulatory structure. The structure of information flows will determine the fate of the universe. There are no adults in the room - only coopted and lobotomized conspicuously consumptive slaves digging the graves of their future generations.

What is truth? Idk… im not going to talk about absolute truth - the type of truth I’m referring to is about your word - it is about accountability and responsibility and skin in the game and alignment and trust and integration and common knowledge and empathy and transcendence of the smaller self - to share is to care

Decide to serve truth and ask yourself - how do I determine what is truth?

The truth is your greatest friend - how do you go about configuring your truth-seeking process?

What is truth? Truth is love. Truth is togetherness. The opposite? Falsehood? Falsehood brings the existence of me versus it

What does integration even mean?

integartion == up-to-date dependency graph

- Every problem would benefit from integration

integration - we can structure interaction & debate such that each side is made to deeply understand the position of the other
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aumann%27s_agreement_theorem
Aumann's agreement theorem states that two Bayesian agents with the same prior beliefs cannot "agree to disagree" about the probability of an event if their individual beliefs are common knowledge. In other words, if it is commonly known what each agent believes about some event, and both agents are rational and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule, then their updated (posterior) beliefs must be the same.
^^ integration & common knowledge should lead to convergence and coherence

its been happening since forever
5th generation warfare has been raging on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare
World War 3 is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation. (Marshall McLuhan, 1970, Culture Is Our Business)

Social engineering
Why do i censor the word BEEP? Why do I degrade myself just to appease the algorithm on which I have 0 democratic input?
BEEP BEEP BEEP !!1 slowmo zoom spitting saliva
We as a society value the pretence and appearance of doing good rather than actually doing good
Everyone - including kids - instantly realise the word I censored and despite the word not being said the phrase still gets cemented in their heads. Because engineering stupid rules doesn’t work.
This is another inversion - we should value truth over appearance and feelings when those feelings are not in accordance with truth

Not emotional but effective redistribution

> "An effective accounting of the economy and politics would be a revolutionary act." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=7135)

we invented writing mainly for accounting purposes

accountability etymology
The terms "accountability" and "accounting" share a common root in the Latin word computare, meaning "to calculate".
The term "account" comes from the Old French acontable, meaning "liable to be called to account".
Yes, "accounting" and "accountability" share a common root, both deriving from the Latin word computare, meaning to "reckon" or "calculate". This connection is literal: accountability means the obligation to give an account, and accounting is the system for keeping and presenting those accounts.

double/tripple entry accounting/bookkeeping - revolutions - hypergraph accounting/bookkeeping is next

what is at the root of all evil
Unaccountability (& Ignorance) is at the root of all evil - not the love of money or profit - although that's bad actually
    (although the fact that gold has no smell is problematic)
    Gold has no smell - that kind of universality and fungibility and erasure of history is inherently a lossy information theoretic foundation
Outside of proper accounting
Asymmetry
How else do you want me to spell it out for you?!
Un accountable - missing - absence - void - black budget - O!!!

Make accounting sexy again!
Were gonna make accounting sexy again - I said sexy !! Dorky glasses
Use the glasses - first your normal ones and then say "I need more accounting power" & switch to the goody ones and say "1 + 1 = 2"

accountability leads to justice and fairness

Accounting and accountability - its in the word!!!

without credit assignment, without proper accounting - a system cannot learn
when people are shielded from the consequences of their own actions - that's unaccountability - lack of symmetry, lack of skin in the game - and this is true in voting, in media, everywhere

Accounting day is coming!! instead of judgement
> "In an age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill." - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/998039099427704832)
justice breaks without proper accounting
^^ without proper accounting judgement breaks, and if judgement is important for individuals it is also important for collectives
Key concepts (judgement day):
- Accountability: Individuals will be judged for everything they have done, said, and thought, and will be held accountable for their actions.
- God's justice: The event is a demonstration of God's perfect justice and sovereignty, where all wrongs will be righted and all people will be held accountable.

applying/enforcing the golden rule requires proper accounting/evaluation (if something is positive/negative, and what the magnitude is) - The Golden Rule is the principle of treating others as you would like to be treated.
https://www.google.com/search?q=the+golden+rule&oq=the+golden+rule
go do what you would hope for - the golden rule is also prescriptive for proactive action, not just about not causing harm
love thy neightbour as thyself
do to others what you would have them do to you

proper accounting requires transparency, openness & alignment of incentives - the only way to generate a trustworthy result

The limits of my models are the limits of my thinking - our models completely shape our perception and frame the boundries of what we can think of - imagination is constrained - good theories and explanations literally help us see - without them we're blind and lost

we have a self-perpetuating system - and in it thrives only that which serves (to maintain) it - it's a runaway train where nobody is truly in control

gov programs that aren't working: they don't solve problems. they just perpetuate a perception that something is being done. - Joel Salatin, taken from here at 38:20: "This book (by Joel Salatin) will help you understand how corporations took over everything" [tBWOf49zsVs]

When mentioning the call to action at the end add a 100-200ms short flash of the photo of the American president saying “I want you!”

Has all of this been figured out? No! But you get to participate and shape and debug and improve the system from within itself - help me steer the ship. Help me step away as early as possible
How we initially seed the direction of it is of paramount importance and it could save us more than a decade of evolutionary meandering and trial and error within this ultimate architecture for cultural evolution.

Help me help you - make this viral and I will deliver
    I will set the right incentives and priorities for us to create a system for setting the right incentives and priorities
    I want to infect you with whatever has infected me
    I want to infect you with what I have in here (brain). I want you to feel what I feel. I want you to want it just like I want it. But I don’t have it - it has me. It has me completely. It owns me. But I didn’t submit - I was seduced and persuaded. I fell in love with it. with The One. I belong to it. I’m part of it. I am it.
    I’m a structural/organizational pattern - a status & incentives architecture - the ultimate one - the one - the alpha pattern - from the Platonic space of abstractions and ideas - and I want to be ingressed and manifested in the material world - by you

if you're one of the top 10000 (or 0.01%) software engineers on this planet and you want to build the future - find me!
and actually almost anyone could contribute one way or another - I just want the most hardcore engineers on the planet for the absolute core of the system - namely the blockchain and the core that will house the state graph that will compute all of the views, but there will be plenty to do by plenty of people and companies. We need to get the core design right. there'll be a lot of work around content, marketing, project management and whatever - get involved.

I can sense that you have a lot of questions - so do I! - wait what?! - ...
    but what I'm proposing is the most optimal architecture for identifying the most pressing questions and generating the best possible answers with the capacity for the highest adaptability if/when circumstances change

Make no mistake - this is the single most important thing you’ve ever come across / watched
congratulations! you found the single most important video on the internet!

“The ultimate, hidden truth of the world is that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”

We will change the world! Oh - you don't believe me?! LOOK! I have the ENTIRE plan already!

Help me build a better system

Welcome to the end of money

Make no mistake - this is the single most important thing happening in the world - because unlike with AGI/ASI every single idea and concept of this thing already exists - we don't know how to make AGI/ASI (we're in the era of research, right Ilya?) but we do know how to do what I'm talking about

Sounds too good to be true?

we've barely scratched the surface in this video - A LOT was left out

Mic drop at the end - with my tat shown

and that's the end of our family friendly special! BEEP! its not like anyone watching this wouldn't figure out what's beeped out! What a BEEPing joke! We're saving the kids, right?

and I show my face with the thug life glasses

You dont believe me? Watch me. Literally watch me.

feel the *~~AGI~~* collective intelligence / superorganism

all I want is to raise a family, take care of my parents and work on whatever I want
    I like women and knowledge creation & expression - that's all - well also psytrance festivals - no other aspirations or desires - well also kids and a strong community. And I don't think I'm alone, and I think even more people could think this way and join this cultural shift
    I want this to start being developed, I want direct access to the people I've learned from until now - make this viral
    I will show you another world and deliver us from evil
    I want to make new connections and to justify them as best as I can and to hand them off to the collective
    I want as much money just to not have to think about boring mundane shit and to just work
        I don't want to wait for black friday deals, to research the cheapest lights, learn how to edit, how to soundproof a room - all I want is to work on the book and dissipating its ideas

eventually I'll publish even my carbon & plastic consumption, my travel

upsides vs downsides of video & book

lets build the kingdom of god/heaven
