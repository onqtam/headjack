== thumbnail:
- intersection of digital ID (passport/ID), reputation & incentives (carrot & stick), & collective intelligence (ant colony?) - ven diagram + an ant colony - the third attractor in the intersection of them



we fail at identifying and prioritising what's most important and relevant

moving from adversarial zero-sum dynamics to synergistic positive-sum


decouple resources for personal use from control over the economy
prestige

externalities


== the stakes
- the future of life on earth depends on this - a crossroads between the 2 types of digital identity



multiple open questions in the hook that gradually get answered in the video:
- what is the ultimate product
- how you can get it

Ultimate desire and how to get it

There isn't a single issue in the world that wouldn't benefit from a more optimal system for coming up with a solution to it
- Every problem would benefit from integration

the product that produces all products.

What should be our ULTIMATE desire?
the ultimate social system.
But WHY?
and why has this been too abstract or intractable for everyone - until now?

the problem: primitive & outdated & (partially) misaligned & wasteful & corrupt & mindless system

don't immediately spill the beans that the ultimate product is the ultimate social system
instead say that everything else you get or experience in life depends on it - it is like the water fish swim in and never thing explicitly about
its like the water - we don't see it, we don't question it, or if we do - we feel powerless

ultimate ==> most consequential, most important, most fundamental - second place is not even close


The future belongs to those who can predict it and that’s why we should incentivise them to share their predictions openly with skin in the game and contribute to our commons

global shared world model
a Worldwide collective Self Model

fundamentally uncensorable
will replace email, 
every single internet service in existence today will eventually migrate & merge with this architecture or fade into irrelevance

the infinite game
    To desire the ultimate social system means wanting a form of collective organization that perfectly harmonizes individual and collective flourishing — a system that:
        Fulfills all material and psychological needs,
        Maximizes freedom and creativity,
        Minimizes suffering and conflict, and
        Sustains itself and the planet indefinitely.
    It’s a desire for the ideal environment in which human (and perhaps non-human) potential can fully unfold.
    The ultimate social system is the most general enabler of all other desires.



once you find/understand it you'll never think about anything else more than about this thing

The more compelling and refined the story becomes - the sooner will the system reach a billion people

I’ve been sitting on
I don’t want to try
I want to succeed
Those who tell the stories rule the world
Theoretically optimal solution - no other design can get even close to the optimal set of technical tradeoffs in my architecture

Nervous system

Differentiation and specialization coupled with alignment and integration

Put your favourite pictures in the video

This is the real situational assessment
^^ this fails by assuming familiarity ("if you know you know")

hearts and minds

anything that's altruistic needs to be rewarded (making it no longer altruistic)
sharing is synergetic - it is more efficient for the whole

Aggregation

We haven’t scratched the surface of the potential of enculturation

a new game the likes of which we could have never even conceived


no ceiling for personal consumption
the status game has no limits in resource use

intro: this video is the culmination of 4 years of work

something larger than ourselves that will persist beyond our lives

- internet 2.0
- fundamental upgrade to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and cognize/think together - collective cognition
- works on any scale - all the way up to the global level
- what would the best possible system we could come up with look like?
- the ultimate product/service is the ultimate social system and we're going to co-discover it
- what is the ultimate product/service? it is the ultimate social system.
- and what is better than a product that spreads by word of mouth? an ideology behind a product that spreads by word of mouth
- A protocol - fundamentally open and uncensorable with string user privacy
- A reversed panopticon
- Ladder of influence and legibility
- Opt-in
- Can scale to tens of billions and has no limitations on the amount of data
- True anonymity with zero knowledge - can even prove to be a real human and prove credentials in a privacy preserving way 
- Self organization
- this system is inevtable if it starts getting going
- Voting on rules of the game & specific issues - not parties and individuals - subjective objectivity
- Bottom up emergent regulation
- Architecture for cultural evolution
- The loss function of a hive mind
- A new incentive architecture that will eventually rival and regulate money itself
- Identity, reputation
- Social credit system
- Collective intelligence & aggregating creativity
- intelligence is always a distributed system - dofferentiation & integration & alignment - the whole more than the sum of the parts
- The ultimate meta system that can solve any problem
- Social operating system multi century old
- Language/writing/printing press
- An economy around solving real problems
- changing property - and no, this isn't simply socialism or communism
- A new form of accounting for contribution and redistributing resources
- The fusion of state/market/academia/media/religion/education
- Reinventing governance and adding market discipline
- Solving alignment for people
- Final major evolutionary transition
- Atick around if you want to be early in the final battle between good and evil
- Digital id can go horribly/terribly wrong & orwellian or incredibly right
- The most flexible and scalable architecture for the evolution of culture and incentives
- Our system fails at conveying why we should care about others
    - why the wellbeing of others is in your best (expanded) self interest
    - Why others matter to us
    System fails at prioritisation which depends on accounting of contribution and causal links
    Its time to start adressing the root of all problems instead of symptoms
- Program or be programmed
- As batman said… digital id is an inevitability
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system

The most important developments this century are AI & CI

collective intelligence - If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Thrives

System fails at communicating why and how to care for others
convincingly

We have all the pieces if the puzzle because of the great unbundling - all we need to do is the great integration

frame control & manipulation

meritocracy

built-in error correction as the highest priority

engineered scarcity

New motivation/mobilization system

Self justifying

Prestige

Choose life

Regulating and steering desire and consumption through culture - redefining status




Open society

Deep democracy
1 man 1 vote only on the base constitution which defines the inequality in the other layers

Bigger than mars - an enabler for it

What should we be coherent around and what not, and how do we determine the boundry and also truth

No single person or group in the entire world has thought as much as me about the intersection of …
^^ early in the clip

Later on:
But is there an MVP or a demo you BBC can try? Why not?
…
And in fact this is the architecture in which we’ll co-create our story

Cultural enlightenment or bust
Showing the video with daniel & brett
& a petri dish bust graphic

We’re gonna make “ought” great again

We did not evolve for such a complex society - we either build the systems to scaffold our capacity upward or we perish
We are the most basic form of general intelligence - the lower bound

We need to replace rhetoric with provable competence and skin in the game

“And how dk u find/get it?”

Those who can predict the future
The extent to which those predictions are shared is the extent to which the future will be shared


PROPERTY! That thing which we fight for
Not emotional but effective redistribution
and instead of simply taxing and taking we should be giving something in return for that surplus - in the current paradigm taxing one's wealth diminishes his power and influence, but we can have a different contract for personal wealth and still allow individuals to garner as much influence over the economy as they deserve, + other forms of prestige & engineered scarcity
liquidity, fungibility
Democratically programmable currency, the end of fungibility



Ev has direction
- greater scales of differentiation, (thermodynamic) integration & cooperation
- greater evolvability
- greater ability to model and predict reality
the most fundamental logic and forces in nature point towards thermodynamic integration and cooperation

A product worth dying for
the most consequences for your life

The next OpenAI will be open collective intelligence OpenCI - Open by Design, Forever - open not by decree but by necessity

Thumbnail: ants / network

Nobody in the world has EVER thought more about the intersection of digital ID, incentives, reputation and collective intelligence than me
No single person or group
put this quite early

Decentralized, infinitely scalable and with no UX limitations

Higher trust, thriving, health, vitality, alignment, meaning, purpose, accountability

Radical
Coherence
Consciousness
baby/infant
Attention regulation - respurce allocation
Deepmind
Unbundling the enlightenment
Rebundling
Variation and selection
Less than 1k nukes before the end of the century
Opt-in, 0 violence
We are multiple orders of magnitude away from our potential with our current resource consumption and human capital
Participatory culture and social co-engineering
Program or be programmed - hivemind
Preserving individual rights and privacy
Optimal synthesis between individualism and collectivism

Current system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating



Moral high ground as a service
Bottom up
50% of carbon emissions from the richest 1%
The other major carbon emitter is militarism - not to mention all the other negatives and wastefulnes and misallocation of human capital

We can - and MUST - reinvent democracy for the digital age

The highest leverage point is not the FEDs interest rate - it is our paradigm

Infinity is within our grasp

the medium really IS the message
The most important thing is what the system puts in people’s heads
It doesn't get more fundamental than that for our species
Enculturation
What is culture - gregg henriques definition

Regulating consumption and redefining status through participatory culture and the intangible hand

Topological sort of whats most important and what leads to what - 2nd, 3rd & 4th order effects
Epistemic commons
heal the Epistemic Commons through incentives for alignment & accountability to then fix all other commons

Picture of the mine in congo - study what is ok to use in videos

If you’re watching this - you’re early to something truly big - the right side of history will unfold before you

The ultimate metric is not gdp but the number of nuclear warheads in the world - we know with high certainty what happens in quasars millions of light years away and yet we can’t seem to figure out how to organize ourselves to not kill and cheat each other.
we are universal explainers




This system will wipe the floor with any other - nothing will be able to compete and every competing power structure will join in their best  newly understood and deeper self interest - not out of fear but through a combination of seduction, shame, and consensual indoctrination

universal colonizer of hearts & minds

The greatest open conspiracy
The best way to predict the future is to co-create it

The window of transcendence will not be open for long
Satoshi opened it with his digital rock but it is just a toy
Welcome to the era of rules without rulers
a rules based order is an actual possibility for the first time in human history

Every single concept & building block & social dynamic from this new system will be reviewed in future videos



The highest leverage point


I’ve been sitting on this architecture for more than 3 years because the most important thing is to get the ideology right

A new reward function to compete and subjugate money

Turning the attention economy from cognitive strip mining to actually economizing our most precious resource

Reconceptualize property

we shall Comprehend the Incomprehensible - why is there something rather than nothing

Cultural Recursive Self-Improvement

Relevance is All we Need
Incentive is All we Need
Alignment is All We Need
Attention is All We Have

Shared Context Window

Solving the Meta/Meaning Crisis

Social resonance and coherence

Merging the market, state, religion, media, academia and education under *~~sha~~* syntropic law

Making the Collective Unconscious Conscious

what you are is what we are - a collective of cooperative parts
A cooperative collective intelligence of parts that gives rise to a higher order entity

our destiny is to jail break / take control of the matrix and become its architects

the greatest "as a service" - Telos & meaning as a service

bringing intelligence to Intelligent Design

The Singleton - crucial for solving global coordination problems

Humanity's Master Plan

Open (Source) Society

Collectivito, ergo sum
or [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) - `"I am because we are"`

turning humanity into a giant neural net

Incentives & credit assignment all the way down

error-correction in every aspect of the system - how it maintains itself, how it improves itself, how it recruits and expands
it will all be evolvable - including the evolvability

The Grandest Narrative
The Next Game

The Hard Problem of Consciousness is how to deepen it for everyone at scale and how to engineer it collectively

Identity is bigger/deeper than money itself

incentives/identity - it doesn't get any deeper or more fundamental than that

> "How does society work? Five words or less: Behavior is determined by incentives... The particular arrangement of incentives across time, space, and causality is called an incentive structure.
>
> ... What about free will? It’s the ability to respond to our incentives. Being a good person? It’s having an incentive to behave in ways we call “good”—that is, wanting to win the virtue game... Let’s give this worldview a name. Let’s call it incentive determinism. Incentive determinism is obvious. It’s just a bunch of tautologies: we are who we are, we want what we want, and we do what we’re caused to do. And yet, barely anybody thinks this way. It’s a cold, alien way of thinking... We spend very little time discussing which incentive structures are the best, and tons of time talking about which sets of words are the right words and which sets of people are the right people. It’s why we write words at all: we think we’re the right people with the right words, and if we just say those words loudly enough, we’ll improve the world.
>
> ... People don’t like incentive determinism because it’s disorienting. It tells us that our single greatest obsession, likability, is a distraction. It’s bullshit—a destroyer of insight, an enemy of understanding. It plays no special role in explaining how the world works. All it does is give us the illusion of understanding—the feeling of superiority to our apparently unlikable rivals (another big incentive for us)—while leaving us in ignorance of the causal structure of the world.
>
> And that causal structure is everything. If there are powerful incentives to help others, then even “evil” people will help others. If there are powerful incentives to hurt others, then even “good” people will hurt others. In fact, if being a “good” person just means being strongly incentivized by others’ moral approval (i.e., really wanting to win the virtue game), then good people are more likely to hurt people when it wins them moral approval. The “good” members of ISIS are the ones who bravely volunteer to commit suicide bombings, and the “bad” members of ISIS are the ones who cravenly fail to make the ultimate sacrifice. People are only as good as their incentives.
>
> But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe figuring out how this all works—understanding the machinery of society—can, itself, change our incentive structures. Insight is a thing in the world that human primates evolved to want, at least sometimes.
>
> If there’s any hope to be found in this cold, alien view of the world, it’s this: the more we all become aware of our incentive structures, the more incentivized we will be to choose them wisely... If we're collectively aware of our incentive structures, and aware that others know that we're aware, then we have an incentive to pick one that makes everyone better off, so that people won't judge us as selfish. So the key is achieving widespread awareness, or common knowledge, of our incentive structures... we're trying to explain the part of reality that is not random. That is all we can do. And when we look at that part, incentives are everything.
>
> ... I don't see incentive determinism as a "theory" so much as a different way of thinking, or a useful conceptual framework. It's honestly just a way of activating a different part of the brain--the tool-use part--to understand society as a machine of moving parts. It's more of a metatheory, really, or a useful way of coming up with other theories. It can give rise to more specific theories about the incentive structures we face, and how they work, which can then be tested. Insofar as the theories it gives rise to are always false, then, sure, it's false. But given that incentive-based thinking lies at the heart of economics and much of social science (not to mention evolutionary biology), it seems like a pretty damn good metatheory and I don't know of a better one. I cannot even conceive a better one, to be honest." - [Incentives Are Everything, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/incentives-are-everything)

GET QUOTE ABOUT CULTURE AND ALSO ABOUT MEANINGFUL INFORMATION




We will engineer money the likes of which you couldnt imagine

Fine tuning every single aspect of society democratically

The end of 1 man 1 vote - democratic inequality of influence, we all get an equal vote about what else to not have an equal vote on

Intitially a parallel system - will not need to be voted in politically to start having effect

We have not even begun to explore the potential of enculturation in a conscious and intentional/deliverate and democratic way

Welcome to the final battle between good & evil - the trajectory of everything in this part of the galaxy that’s beautiful is at stake
Or finish with “evil”
The next 2 decades will determine the unfolding of life’s trajectory
liberty vs tyranny / oppression
cooperation vs defection
functional complexification vs catastrophic simplification
thriving vs decay
meaning vs nihilism
transcendence vs decadence
emergence vs extinction
transcendence/evolution/eternity vs extinction
Cultural Evolution vs Cultural Devolution
Good vs. Evil: Cultural Assimilator vs Incinerator
!! grab the camera and talk to it from up close when finishing with good vs evil

Signal from noise

There isnt a single problem that wouldnt benefit from better aggregation  & integration & better incentives

I wanted to solve the single biggest problem for humanity - the kind of system it runs
Oh u want to go to mars? Thats cute. You know what would help immensely? The Great Enabler! A better F System!


a real world model is a model of the world, by the world, for the world

Consequence capture
Credit assignment
Interrelated

We will take over the world - together
Spread the word

At the core of intelligent systems is their capacity for relevance realization - to pay attention to relevant stimuli & memories and to manifess the most relevant behavioral response

CC
The degree to which we implement CC is the degree to which we are aligned and optimally self-organizing
We need a system that systematically identifies altruistic endeavors and rewards them accordingly to their impact
The degree to which we exploit synergy is the degree to which we shall prosper



A new kind of Self-Correcting Authority

close the niche for psychopathy at scale
Closing the sociopathic niche

we can pass The Great Filter

this is how we make A Dent in the Universe

our system wasn't consciously designed - it mostly evolved by happenstance & contingency

Incentives from first principles AKA life's thermodynamic imperative
solving the same thermodynamic imperative on each consecutive level

Recognition Economy

Vibe code society with values

better incentives to innovate, share, optimize, align
transparency
less corruption & misalignment
market discipline

shared worldview

we need a system of incentives & accountability & structured interaction to transcend our tribal nature and all the bias & corruption that comes with it

stick around as we'll gradually explore the different aspects of the system - the earlier you familiarize yourself - the earlier you'd be a power user


we need to be on the same page on what we need to be on the same page
common knowledge
