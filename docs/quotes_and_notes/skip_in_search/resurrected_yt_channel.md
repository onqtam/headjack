GLING VS DESCRIPT:
- filler word removal:
    gling has the best mistake removal
    gling: automatic & timeline-centric
    descript: manual & transcript-centric
- fixing wrong words
    descript: lets you change words in the transcript and overdub & crossfade them automatically with your voice using AI - but does it also do video - not just audio?


gling can export to davinci so I don't need to use their renderer (if it's shit - some say it is)

- eye contact:
    - descript - 35$ a month 
    - Captions.ai - 10$ month
    - CapCut - but seems a bit shitty

# CHANNEL STUFF
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

uploading:
- don't immediately publish - wait for HD to be ready
- don't share with friends & unrelated audiences
- don't open it yourself and add fake views - leave it to the algo - maybe this is BS

channel:
- more professional
- what's the value prop
- avoid shorts - people who come from shorts don't stay long and give a bad signal to the algo
- check if more people come from search or other sources, if search is low - don't put too many keywords with high hopes
- look where people drop off from the video and maybe cut out those bad sections

wallpaper background in room

redo channel banner

get the rug on the floor for less echo

draw on excalidraw

video structure:
- hook (a question) + maybe a few sec of the most interesting part of the video + a very bold/provocative statement
- the hook should meet it in the first 10 sec and even EXCEED them
    - title & thumbnail (T&T) set the expectation
    - first sentence matches the title, first shot matches the thumbnail
    - can use text & arrows/pointers in the first shot to describe the different elements
    - no need to be 1 for 1, but should be close enough to assure viewers that the T&T weren't clickbait
    - contrast or comparison (current belief/state vs what it should be)
        - current baseline vs contrarian offer - the distance between them is the contrast
        - implied vs stated contrast - either state it explicitly or imply it indirectly ("this is 8x more effective" - baseline being ineffective is implied)
    - 6 words in a hook:
        - subject ("if you/I"), action ("had to grow a YT channel"), objective or end state change ("from 0 to 100k subs"), contrast (objective from current state, "0 to 100k subs"), proof ("again" - I've done it before), time/urgency ("in 5 months", "before EOY")
- 10-30 sec intro after the hook
    - create 1 or more curiosity gaps
        - people should want closure to the open loops created
        - blur things out that will be revealed later
    - provide the right context
    - input bias
        - "The Input Bias: The Misuse of Input Information in Judgments of Outcomes"
        - specifically mention how much time & work you've poured into it - the more input - the bias goes - the more value?
        - can show the timeline of the video in the editor
    - show - don't tell - killer intros don't just tell - they show
- find way to incentivise watching till the end - promise to reveal a secret at the end? a big payoff
- there should be causation within the video - not simply going over a list of things, but in a way where item X leads to item X+1
- many people preview the video before clicking on it - first 5 sec should be like the thumbnail, is the hook interesting even without audio? also have captions in the hook, more cuts help in the first 10 sec. Video previews can be turned off in the playback and performance settings.
- frontload stimulus in hook/intro - change visuals every 1.5-2 seconds
    - before users have committed to viewing the video and entering full screen and ignoring other recommended videos
- focus on the dips where people drop off - fix them for future vids & maybe even cut them out in the editor
- content (value)
    - use plenty of stock footage and graphics - have something change every few (or 10+) seconds - within reason
        - or use movement: slowly (or abruptly) change scale/position (zoom/pan)
        - or add captions - but very selectively! only if emphasis is really required
        - guide the viewer's attention to parts of images - don't simply expect that they'll easily & quickly focus on the most relevant bits
        - animate the most important pieces of text/image/background, or also dim/darken/blur the rest of the screen
        - whenever a graphic comes to the screen - it should be with at least some animation, or use a shutter/pop sound effect
        - think about where the viewer is looking at - don't make him move his eyes too much between cuts - unimmersive
        - breaking visual continuity from time to time is ok
    - problem-solution, problem-solution
    - not just linearly "and, and, and" (disorienting - doesn't specify how one thing is linked to the next)
        - every "and" is a point where the viewer can disengage
        - better: "we tried this, but that got in the way, therefore we had to do this, but it didn't work, so we tried this"
            - seamless flow - immersed from start to finish
    - what intrigues: uncertainty
    - communicate the value of the video better - let viewers know what they'll get out of it
        - viewers must know: what's happening, why it's important, what could go wrong
        - clear & concise isn't good enough - viewers must see it in action - analogy! example!
        - take full advantage of visual communication: always show a visual about what you're talking about
- outro - end screen sales pitch - no "like/comment/sub" (meaningless) but redirect to another video & discord










== thumbnail & title (T&T)
- create 3 and give them to YT to A/B test and pick the best one
- less is more
- titles should be clear but don't spoil anything
- most important part of titles should be closer to the start
- contrasting colors
- set expectations, induce emotion, clear and simple, brighter in color, instantly understandable the concept being conveyed
- face/emotion, only if can convey emotion
- clear text & selective ALL CAPS for emphasis
- elicit an emotion
- needs to induce a curiosity gap & challenge the assumptions of the viewer
    - use a question or get the viewer to ask "what happens next?"
    - the reason to watch should be immediately apparent
- aim for 50 characters
- don't source frames from your video for yout thumbnail - use other sources
- don't put too much - takes more time to process by viewers

# NEW INTRO VIDEO
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

== title:
- What should/MUST be our ULTIMATE desire? The Organizational Imperative

== thumbnail:
- intersection of digital ID (passport/ID), reputation & incentives (carrot & stick), & collective intelligence (ant colony?) - ven diagram + an ant colony - the third attractor in the intersection of them



we fail at identifying and prioritising what's most important and relevant

moving from adversarial zero-sum dynamics to synergistic positive-sum


decouple resources for personal use from control over the economy
prestige

externalities


multiple open questions in the hook that gradually get answered in the video:
- what is the ultimate product
- how you can get it

Ultimate desire and how to get it

There isn't a single issue in the world that wouldn't benefit from a more optimal system for coming up with a solution to it
- Every problem would benefit from integration

the product that produces all products.

What should be our ULTIMATE desire?
the ultimate social system.
But WHY?
and why has this been too abstract or intractable for everyone - until now?

the problem: primitive & outdated & (partially) misaligned & wasteful & corrupt & mindless system

don't immediately spill the beans that the ultimate product is the ultimate social system
instead say that everything else you get or experience in life depends on it - it is like the water fish swim in and never thing explicitly about
its like the water - we don't see it, we don't question it, or if we do - we feel powerless

ultimate ==> most consequential, most important, most fundamental - second place is not even close


The future belongs to those who can predict it and that’s why we should incentivise them to share their predictions openly with skin in the game and contribute to our commons

global shared world model
a Worldwide collective Self Model

fundamentally uncensorable
will replace email, 
every single internet service in existence today will eventually migrate & merge with this architecture or fade into irrelevance

the infinite game
    To desire the ultimate social system means wanting a form of collective organization that perfectly harmonizes individual and collective flourishing — a system that:
        Fulfills all material and psychological needs,
        Maximizes freedom and creativity,
        Minimizes suffering and conflict, and
        Sustains itself and the planet indefinitely.
    It’s a desire for the ideal environment in which human (and perhaps non-human) potential can fully unfold.
    The ultimate social system is the most general enabler of all other desires.



once you find/understand it you'll never think about anything else more than about this thing

The more compelling and refined the story becomes - the sooner will the system reach a billion people

I’ve been sitting on
I don’t want to try
I want to succeed
Those who tell the stories rule the world
Theoretically optimal solution - no other design can get even close to the optimal set of technical tradeoffs in my architecture

Nervous system

Differentiation and specialization coupled with alignment and integration

Put your favourite pictures in the video

This is the real situational assessment

Aggregation

We haven’t scratched the surface of the potential of enculturation

a new game the likes of which we could have never even conceived


no ceiling for personal consumption
the status game has no limits in resource use

intro: this video is the culmination of 4 years of work

something larger than ourselves that will persist beyond our lives

- internet 2.0
- fundamental upgrade to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and cognize/think together - collective cognition
- works on any scale - all the way up to the global level
- what would the best possible system we could come up with look like?
- the ultimate product/service is the ultimate social system and we're going to co-discover it
- what is the ultimate product/service? it is the ultimate social system.
- and what is better than a product that spreads by word of mouth? an ideology behind a product that spreads by word of mouth
- A protocol - fundamentally open and uncensorable with string user privacy
- A reversed panopticon
- Ladder of influence and legibility
- Opt-in
- Can scale to tens of billions and has no limitations on the amount of data
- True anonymity with zero knowledge - can even prove to be a real human and prove credentials in a privacy preserving way 
- Self organization
- this system is inevtable if it starts getting going
- Voting on rules of the game & specific issues - not parties and individuals - subjective objectivity
- Bottom up emergent regulation
- Architecture for cultural evolution
- The loss function of a hive mind
- A new incentive architecture that will eventually rival and regulate money itself
- Identity, reputation
- Social credit system
- Collective intelligence & aggregating creativity
- intelligence is always a distributed system - dofferentiation & integration & alignment - the whole more than the sum of the parts
- The ultimate meta system that can solve any problem
- Social operating system multi century old
- Language/writing/printing press
- An economy around solving real problems
- changing property - and no, this isn't simply socialism or communism
- A new form of accounting for contribution and redistributing resources
- The fusion of state/market/academia/media/religion/education
- Reinventing governance and adding market discipline
- Solving alignment for people
- Final major evolutionary transition
- Atick around if you want to be early in the final battle between good and evil
- Digital id can go horribly/terribly wrong & orwellian or incredibly right
- The most flexible and scalable architecture for the evolution of culture and incentives
- Our system fails at conveying why we should care about others
    - why the wellbeing of others is in your best (expanded) self interest
    - Why others matter to us
    System fails at prioritisation which depends on accounting of contribution and causal links
    Its time to start adressing the root of all problems instead of symptoms
- Program or be programmed
- As batman said… digital id is an inevitability
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system
- title: the hyper bull case for digital ID & Internet 2.0, the ultimate product? ultimate social system

The most important developments this century are AI & CI

collective intelligence - If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Thrives

System fails at communicating why and how to care for others
convincingly

We have all the pieces if the puzzle because of the great unbundling - all we need to do is the great integration

built-in error correction as the highest priority

skin in the game

New motivation/mobilization system

Self justifying

Prestige

Choose life

Regulating and steering desire and consumption through culture - redefining status




Open society

Deep democracy
1 man 1 vote only on the base constitution which defines the inequality in the other layers

Bigger than mars - an enabler for it

What should we be coherent around and what not, and how do we determine the boundry and also truth

No single person or group in the entire world has thought as much as me about the intersection of …
^^ early in the clip

Later on:
But is there an MVP or a demo you BBC can try? Why not?
…
And in fact this is the architecture in which we’ll co-create our story

Cultural enlightenment or bust
Showing the video with daniel & brett
& a petri dish bust graphic

We’re gonna make “ought” great again

We did not evolve for such a complex society - we either build the systems to scaffold our capacity upward or we perish
We are the most basic form of general intelligence - the lower bound

We need to replace rhetoric with provable competence and skin in the game

“And how dk u find/get it?”

Those who can predict the future
The extent to which those predictions are shared is the extent to which the future will be shared

Not emotional but effective redistribution




Ev has direction
- greater scales of differentiation, (thermodynamic) integration & cooperation
- greater evolvability
- greater ability to model and predict reality
the most fundamental logic and forces in nature point towards thermodynamic integration and cooperation

A product worth dying for
the most consequences for your life

The next OpenAI will be open collective intelligence OpenCI - Open by Design, Forever - open not by decree but by necessity

Thumbnail: ants / network

Nobody in the world has EVER thought more about the intersection of digital ID, incentives, reputation and collective intelligence than me
No single person or group
put this quite early

Decentralized, infinitely scalable and with no UX limitations

Higher trust, thriving, health, vitality, alignment, meaning, purpose, accountability

Radical
Coherence
Consciousness
baby/infant
Attention regulation - respurce allocation
Deepmind
Unbundling the enlightenment
Rebundling
Variation and selection
Democratically programmable currency, the end of fungibility
Less than 1k nukes before the end of the century
Opt-in, 0 violence
We are multiple orders of magnitude away from our potential with our current resource consumption and human capital
Participatory culture and social co-engineering
Program or be programmed - hivemind
Preserving individual rights and privacy
Optimal synthesis between individualism and collectivism

Current system is primitive, wasteful, misaligned and mindless - it is self-terminating



Moral high ground as a service
Bottom up
50% of carbon emissions from the richest 1%
The other major carbon emitter is militarism - not to mention all the other negatives and wastefulnes and misallocation of human capital

We can - and MUST - reinvent democracy for the digital age

Mic drop at the end

The highest leverage point is not the FEDs interest rate - it is our paradigm

Infinity is within our grasp

the medium really IS the message
The most important thing is what the system puts in people’s heads
It doesn't get more fundamental than that for our species
Enculturation
What is culture - gregg henriques definition

Regulating consumption and redefining status through participatory culture and the intangible hand

Topological sort of whats most important and what leads to what - 2nd, 3rd & 4th order effects
Epistemic commons

Picture of the mine in congo - study what is ok to use in videos

If you’re watching this - you’re early to something truly big - the right side of history will unfold before you

The ultimate metric is not gdp but the number of nuclear warheads in the world - we know with high certainty what happens in quasars millions of light years away and yet we can’t seem to figure out how to organize ourselves to not kill and cheat each other.
we are universal explainers




This system will wipe the floor with any other - nothing will be able to compete and every competing power structure will join in their best  newly understood and deeper self interest - not out of fear but through a combination of seduction, shame, and consensual indoctrination

universal colonizer of hearts & minds

The greatest open conspiracy
The best way to predict the future is to co-create it

The window of transcendence will not be open for long
Satoshi opened it with his digital rock but it is just a toy
Welcome to the era of rules without rulers
a rules based order is an actual possibility for the first time in human history

Every single concept & building block & social dynamic from this new system will be reviewed in future videos



The highest leverage point


I’ve been sitting on this architecture for more than 3 years because the most important thing is to get the ideology right

A new reward function to compete and subjugate money

Turning the attention economy from cognitive strip mining to actually economizing our most precious resource

Reconceptualize property

we shall Comprehend the Incomprehensible - why is there something rather than nothing

Cultural Recursive Self-Improvement

Relevance is All we Need
Incentive is All we Need
Alignment is All We Need
Attention is All We Have

Shared Context Window

Solving the Meta/Meaning Crisis

Social resonance and coherence

Merging the market, state, religion, media, academia and education under *~~sha~~* syntropic law

Making the Collective Unconscious Conscious

what you are is what we are - a collective of cooperative parts
A cooperative collective intelligence of parts that gives rise to a higher order entity

our destiny is to jail break / take control of the matrix and become its architects

the greatest "as a service" - Telos & meaning as a service

bringing intelligence to Intelligent Design

The Singleton - crucial for solving global coordination problems

Humanity's Master Plan

heal the Epistemic Commons through incentives for alignment & accountability to then fix all other commons

Open (Source) Society

Collectivito, ergo sum
or [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) - `"I am because we are"`

turning humanity into a giant neural net

Incentives & credit assignment all the way down

The Grandest Narrative
The Next Game

The Hard Problem of Consciousness is how to deepen it for everyone at scale and how to engineer it collectively

Identity is bigger/deeper than money itself

We will engineer money the likes of which you couldnt imagine

Fine tuning every single aspect of society democratically

The end of 1 man 1 vote - democratic inequality of influence, we all get an equal vote about what else to not have an equal vote on

Intitially a parallel system - will not need to be voted in politically to start having effect

We have not even begun to explore the potential of enculturation in a conscious and intentional/deliverate and democratic way

Welcome to the final battle between good & evil - the trajectory of everything in this part of the galaxy that’s beautiful is at stake
Or finish with “evil”
The next 2 decades will determine the unfolding of life’s trajectory
liberty vs tyranny / oppression
cooperation vs defection
functional complexification vs catastrophic simplification
thriving vs decay
meaning vs nihilism
transcendence vs decadence
emergence vs extinction
transcendence/evolution/eternity vs extinction
Cultural Evolution vs Cultural Devolution
Good vs. Evil: Cultural Assimilator vs Incinerator
!! grab the camera and talk to it from up close when finishing with good vs evil

Signal from noise

A new kind of Self-Correcting Authority

close the niche for psychopathy at scale
Closing the sociopathic niche

we can pass The Great Filter

this is how we make A Dent in the Universe

our system wasn't consciously designed - it mostly evolved by happenstance & contingency

Incentives from first principles AKA life's thermodynamic imperative
solving the same thermodynamic imperative on each consecutive level

Recognition Economy

Vibe code society with values

better incentives to innovate, share, optimize, align
transparency
less corruption & misalignment
market discipline

shared worldview

we need a system of incentives & accountability & structured interaction to transcend our tribal nature and all the bias & corruption that comes with it

stick around as we'll gradually explore the different aspects of the system - the earlier you familiarize yourself - the earlier you'd be a power user
