# DIFFERENT APPS

GLING VS DESCRIPT:
- filler word removal:
    gling has the best mistake removal
    gling: automatic & timeline-centric
    descript: manual & transcript-centric
- fixing wrong words
    descript: lets you change words in the transcript and overdub & crossfade them automatically with your voice using AI - but does it also do video - not just audio?


gling can export to davinci so I don't need to use their renderer (if it's shit - some say it is)

- eye contact:
    - descript - 35$ a month 
    - Captions.ai - 10$ month
    - CapCut - but seems a bit shitty


firecut.ai

captions.ai

descript export quality: bad?

# CHANNEL STUFF
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

uploading:
- don't immediately publish - wait for HD to be ready
- don't share with friends & unrelated audiences
- don't open it yourself and add fake views - leave it to the algo - maybe this is BS

channel:
- more professional
- what's the value prop
- avoid shorts - people who come from shorts don't stay long and give a bad signal to the algo
- check if more people come from search or other sources, if search is low - don't put too many keywords with high hopes
- look where people drop off from the video and maybe cut out those bad sections

video structure:
- hook (a question) + maybe a few sec of the most interesting part of the video + a very bold/provocative statement
- the hook should meet it in the first 10 sec and even EXCEED them
    - title & thumbnail (T&T) set the expectation
    - first sentence matches the title, first shot matches the thumbnail
    - can use text & arrows/pointers in the first shot to describe the different elements
    - no need to be 1 for 1, but should be close enough to assure viewers that the T&T weren't clickbait
    - contrast or comparison (current belief/state vs what it should be)
        - current baseline vs contrarian offer - the distance between them is the contrast
        - implied vs stated contrast - either state it explicitly or imply it indirectly ("this is 8x more effective" - baseline being ineffective is implied)
    - 6 words in a hook:
        - subject ("if you/I"), action ("had to grow a YT channel"), objective or end state change ("from 0 to 100k subs"), contrast (objective from current state, "0 to 100k subs"), proof ("again" - I've done it before), time/urgency ("in 5 months", "before EOY")
- 10-30 sec intro after the hook
    - create 1 or more curiosity gaps
        - people should want closure to the open loops created
        - blur things out that will be revealed later
    - provide context
    - introduce stakes/payoff
    - input bias
        - "The Input Bias: The Misuse of Input Information in Judgments of Outcomes"
        - specifically mention how much time & work you've poured into it - the more input - the bias goes - the more value?
        - can show the timeline of the video in the editor
        - also simply the quality of the video speaks for itself as how much input/work went into it
    - show - don't tell - killer intros don't just tell - they show
- find way to incentivise watching till the end - promise to reveal a secret at the end? a big payoff
- there should be causation within the video - not simply going over a list of things, but in a way where item X leads to item X+1
- many people preview the video before clicking on it - first 5 sec should be like the thumbnail, is the hook interesting even without audio? also have captions in the hook, more cuts help in the first 10 sec. Video previews can be turned off in the playback and performance settings.
- frontload stimulus in hook/intro - change visuals every 1.5-2 seconds - more cuts !!!
    - simply zooming in/out counts as cuts & keeps retention
    - before users have committed to viewing the video and entering full screen and ignoring other recommended videos
- focus on the dips where people drop off - fix them for future vids & maybe even cut them out in the editor
- content (value)
    - use plenty of stock footage and graphics - have something change every few (or 10+) seconds - within reason
        - or use movement: slowly (or abruptly) change scale/position (zoom/pan)
        - or add captions - but very selectively! only if emphasis is really required
        - guide the viewer's attention to parts of images - don't simply expect that they'll easily & quickly focus on the most relevant bits
        - animate the most important pieces of text/image/background, or also dim/darken/blur the rest of the screen
        - whenever a graphic comes to the screen - it should be with at least some animation, or use a shutter/pop sound effect
        - think about where the viewer is looking at - don't make him move his eyes too much between cuts - unimmersive
        - breaking visual continuity from time to time is ok
    - problem-solution, problem-solution
        - consistent contrast - multiple side stories - multiple cycles of high/low energy
        - each section with a payoff should have a setup before it and the progress is between the setup & payoff
            - without the right setup or progress the payoff is confusing
    - not just linearly "and, and, and" (disorienting - doesn't specify how one thing is linked to the next)
        - every "and" is a point where the viewer can disengage
        - better: "we tried this, but that got in the way, therefore we had to do this, but it didn't work, so we tried this"
            - seamless flow - immersed from start to finish
    - what intrigues: uncertainty
    - communicate the value of the video better - let viewers know what they'll get out of it
        - viewers must know: what's happening, why it's important, what could go wrong
        - clear & concise isn't good enough - viewers must see it in action - analogy! example!
        - take full advantage of visual communication: always show a visual about what you're talking about
- end on a high note
- outro - end screen sales pitch - no "like/comment/sub" (meaningless) but redirect to another video & discord










== thumbnail & title (T&T)
- create 3 and give them to YT to A/B test and pick the best one - you can do multiple successive A/B tests !!!
- less is more
- titles should be clear but don't spoil anything
- most important part of titles should be closer to the start
- contrasting colors
- set expectations, induce emotion, clear and simple, brighter in color, instantly understandable the concept being conveyed
- face/emotion, only if can convey emotion
- clear text & selective ALL CAPS for emphasis
- elicit an emotion
- needs to induce a curiosity gap & challenge the assumptions of the viewer
    - use a question or get the viewer to ask "what happens next?"
    - the reason to watch should be immediately apparent
- aim for 50 characters
- don't source frames from your video for yout thumbnail - use other sources
- don't put too much - takes more time to process by viewers



thumbnail idea for future:
- me next to a whiteboard with bullet points & grahps from the video
    https://prnt.sc/-7AaAuNuW2qF



all videos in a channel need to adress the same audience !!! everything should be interconnected & relevant
the format should also be consistent... what to do with podcasts & clips from them? :/
channel should support momentum
think of the channel as a TV show
the 80/20 rule: "would 80% of the audience of my last video be interested in my next video?"

don't assume familiarity ("if you know you know") - videos shouldn't assume that viewers are aware of the whole project

the 3 Cs of YT visuals: Content, Clarity, Continuity

integration
    why/how google failed with their core mission (not just the "don't be evil" one) - integration - and how we'll succeed
    Google's biggest failure LITERALLY nobody is talking about
    no - search sucking isn't a sign of their failure - the fact that they didn't change the way information is created and linked on the internet is their failure because that's what it would take to organize the world's information

status
    The Great Reset - with Schwab with red lines on top of him and a 1st/2nd/3rd place podium for status
