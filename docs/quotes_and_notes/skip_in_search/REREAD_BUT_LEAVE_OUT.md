> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter-intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self-reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Beings are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we are all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)




goal-directedness, dynamic systems theory, attractors & basins of attraction
Not sure if anything (apart from an attractor definition) is usable from this, but worth re-reading. Or maybe the entire paper.

> "ATTEMPTS AT DEFINING GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS
>
> ... the world is full of systems, such as bacteria, cheetahs, people and corporations, which behave as if they are striving to achieve some as yet distant goal state.
>
> ... Perhaps the simplest operational definition of goal-directedness is **equifinality**. This is the notion that different initial states of a system all lead to the same final state... For example, the bacterium will end up at the food source and the hunting cheetah at the gazelle no matter which position they started out from within that goal state’s broad neighborhood... However, this is no longer true for the irreversible dynamics implied by thermodynamics. Here, initial differences tend to be erased by the inexorable increase of entropy. For example, a ball that rolls down into a bowl will come to rest in the lowest point at the bottom of the bowl, having dissipated its energy of motion through friction. It does not matter where in the bowl (initial state) the ball started its trajectory: the end point will always be the same equilibrium state of minimal potential energy. This type of equifinality is not what we would intuitively see as goal-directedness, though. This problem can be avoided by demanding that the final state would be a steady state “far-from-equilibrium”, i.e. a state that requires active intervention and a continuing flow of energy to reach and maintain. Indeed, life is a far-fromequilibrium condition, and organisms cannot survive without a constant source of energy to keep their metabolism going. This also captures our intuitive notion of agency as being active, i.e. mobilizing energy or resources in order to combat physical forces such as dissipation. The ball in the bowl, on the other hand, is merely passively obeying the external forces of gravity and friction. That is why von Bertalanffy restricted equifinality to open systems that exchange resources with their environment.
>
> ... The philosopher Nagel tried to define goal-directedness in a similar vein... he distinguished two requirements for goaldirectedness: **plasticity** and **persistence**. Plasticity is roughly equivalent to equifinality. The agent is “plastic” in the sense that it can adapt to a wide variety of initial conditions and still find a way to end up at the same goal. It is moreover “persistent” in the sense that if that movement is perturbed, so that the agent is made to deviate from its anticipated trajectory, it will establish a new trajectory pointing towards the same target, thus persisting in its movement towards the goal. Note that it can be argued that persistence is not an independent condition, but merely an aspect of equifinality: the deviation merely pushes the agent to a different initial state, from which it will now again hone in on the same end state. For a goal-directed trajectory, it does not really matter whether the initial state was the product of a perturbation or not... Nagel added a third, less well-defined criterion, of which different versions have been echoed by different authors. The idea is that agents make use of a repertoire of complementary actions, components or functions that work together in a coordinated manner in order to achieve the goal... A perhaps better term is what I will henceforth call **concerted action**: the activities of the different components of the system work together in a driven, coordinated manner, so as to efficiently mobilize the resources needed for the achievement of the goal state...
>
> GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS IN CYBERNETICS
>
> A final, and perhaps most elegant, way to operationally define goal-directedness is the one proposed by cybernetics. The cybernetic conception assumes equifinality and persistence, but proposes a precise mechanism through which these are realized: regulation through negative feedback... Cybernetics introduced the notion of circular causality to explain how a goal can causally affect an initial state without contradicting the fact that causes precede effects.
>
> Although apparently paradoxical, circular causality can be implemented simply by feeding the output (effect, result) of some system or process back to its input (cause, initial condition). This is also known as re-entry, and is the basis of what in mathematics and computer science is known as recursion. As I will illustrate further, circular organization, in the sense of the system producing (part of) its own input, makes that system to some degree autonomous, i.e. able to maintain its own dynamics without being at the mercy of external inputs that it does not control. This crucial feature of self-determination can also be seen as a form of bootstrapping: it is as if the system lifts itself up (movement towards the goal) by pulling (output action) on its own bootstraps (input component).
>
> Note that this circularity occurs in space, not in time: the output is redirected to affect the same component or variable of the system that was affected by the input, i.e. where the process started. But that feedback of course cannot arrive before the initial input—though it can be nearly simultaneous, allowing for a practically instantaneous regulation of the input.
>
> For the simplest form of cybernetic regulation, you merely need a feedback that is negative. That means that the effect of the re-entered output is opposite to the effect of the input that caused it. In practice, this means that if some perturbation (input) has made the system deviate from its goal-directed course, then the reaction of the system (resulting output fed back to become a new input) will counteract or compensate that deviation, thus putting the system back on track towards achieving the goal...
>
> A DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS INTERPRETATION OF GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS
>
> ... In the theory of dynamic systems, an attractor is defined as a region in state space that the system can enter, but cannot leave—and that contains no smaller such region. An attractor is surrounded by a basin of attraction. This consists of all the states whose trajectories converge to the attractor. That means that the dynamics of the system is such that if you calculate the trajectory starting from any initial state in the basin, then that trajectory will eventually reach the attractor and stay there. The attractor functions as the final destination of all trajectories that start in its basin. Under conditions that I will further specify, it can therefore be understood as the “goal” or “end” of the system... In practice, however, a real-life system, such as an organism, an ecosystem or an economy, is subjected to various unpredictable perturbations that make it deviate from its initial trajectory. These perturbations result from events that the system does not control, i.e. that are not part of its dynamics as defined by the function f. They typically originate in the system’s environment. Examples are encounters with other organisms, accidents or changes in the weather. Because of such external disturbances, the precise trajectory of a complex system, such as an organism, is in practice impossible to predict. Nevertheless, if we know the attractors and their basins, then the final destination becomes predictable again: as long as the perturbations do not push the system outside of its present basin, its dynamics will sooner or later lead it back to that basin’s attractor... The term “attractor” may be misleading, though. It is not the attractor that exerts some pulling force, attracting the system towards itself. It is the system, because of its own, intrinsic dynamics, that is consistently moving towards the attractor, and that will persist doing so even if pushed away from its initial trajectory by a perturbation (that does not leave the basin)... If we make the additional assumption that the attractor is not an equilibrium state of minimal potential energy, like the ball at the bottom of the bowl, then this attractor-directed movement requires the on-going mobilization of energy-providing resources. This is necessary to climb up any potential energy gradients and to compensate for energy lost through dissipation. Therefore, the system’s moves towards the attractor and against deviations can be interpreted as goal-directed actions. Such a system exhibits a basic form of agency: it actively resists forces pulling and pushing it, rather than passively being subjected to them, like the ball being pulled down by the force of gravity...
>
> CONCERTED ACTION
>
> ... But where did the primary goal of survival come from? This is another way of formulating the origin of life problem: how did an assemblage of physico-chemical processes that were not goal-directed give rise to an organization that was efficiently directed at the goal of self-maintenance? And how did such an organization develop the necessary plasticity and persistence to dependably achieve that goal in a highly variable environment bombarding it with a wide variety of perturbations?...
>
> ATTRACTORS AND BASINS
>
> ... Another common type of attractor is a limit cycle. Here the endpoint of the process is not a single state but a continuously repeating sequence of states... A classic example of this type of attractor can be found in the cyclical increases and decreases in the populations of predators and prey... But a limit cycle could also describe various metabolic cycles inside the organism in which certain molecules or structures are periodically broken down and then rebuilt. Such cycles must be kept going, and any deviation from them must be opposed so that the system converges back to its attractor. The goal here is not a state, but a periodic process...
>
> ... A perhaps unconventional attractor regime can be represented by an infinite line. (Note that the line itself is not strictly an attractor, but a component of an attractor basin that converges toward an attractor lying at infinity.) This can describe processes of on-going growth, where certain variables, such as population, size or experience increase without a priori limit... Such return to an ideal process rather than an ideal state may be called homeorhesis (“flowing the same”) instead of homeostasis...
>
> ... An important issue is that goal-directedness is characterized by sufficient plasticity, persistence and concerted action. All of these imply a large basin of attraction surrounding the attractor/goal. The larger the basin, the larger the number of initial states ending up in the attractor (equifinality, plasticity), the larger the deviations from its initial trajectory the system will be able to compensate (persistence, negative feedback), and the larger the number of variables that it will be able to control in a coordinated, goal-directed manner (dynamical coherence, concerted action). Now, imagine an attractor with a small surrounding basin that extends just a little outside the attractor. The smallest perturbation will be sufficient to push the system across the border of that basin, into the basin of a different attractor. That means that it cannot on its own return to its goal. Goal-directedness here is very weak, because the system is hardly able to resist any perturbation from its preferred configuration. Such a goal configuration is fragile or brittle. The opposite of brittleness is robustness, or more precisely resilience, i.e. the ability to bounce back to the goal configuration after undergoing a more or less intense perturbation. Thus, from the dynamical systems perspective, effective goal-directedness appears equivalent to the resilience of the goal configuration...
>
> Another question worth raising is how a dynamical system can model subordinate goals (e.g. feeding), which are in reality merely way-stations, stepping stones or means that lead to the overall goal or end (e.g. surviving). An attractor by definition is the ultimate outcome of a process. Any intermediate steps towards this end must therefore be situated in the basin, not in the attractor. Yet, they may still be attractors for a subsystem of the overall dynamic system, i.e. a partial system that lacks certain components or variables. For example, the goal of feeding can be modelled as an attractor if we consider “hunger” not as a variable, but as a fixed property with the value “high”. For hungry cheetahs, feeding is the dominant goal. However, if we turn “hunger” into a variable, the model would need to incorporate an additional dynamics which states that hunger decreases sharply after feeding, that the system in a state of low hunger is directed at “resting and digesting”, and that the latter activity slowly increases the value of the variable “hunger”, until we get back to a state where “feeding” is the dominant goal. Such an additional variable plays the role of a control parameter, which changes the dynamics in such a way that stable solutions (attractors) may shift, bifurcate, or disappear while the parameter value changes. An example of such an approach can be found in Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a cybernetics-inspired dynamical model of goal-directed behavior in organisms and people. Here, a goal (reference value to which a negative feedback control loop converges) at a subordinate level is set by the action (output) of a control loop directed at a goal of a higher level. The higher-level control loop takes into account additional perceived variables (such as hunger) to specify which goal (e.g. feeding or resting) the subordinate loop should target. This method of turning a goal state that is fixed at one level into a variable that is controlled at a higher level allows PCT to develop a complex, multilevel hierarchy of goals for describing behavior on both short-term and long-term time scales.
>
> THE ORIGIN OF GOAL-DIRECTED SYSTEMS
>
> ... Implicitly, though, evolutionary theory specifies the most fundamental goal of all: survival. For far-from-equilibrium systems, survival means first of all active self-maintenance: the continuous repair and reconstitution of components and structures that would otherwise be consumed by the inevitable production of entropy. This concerns in particular the dynamical structure that distinguishes the “self”, i.e. the system to be maintained, from its environment, i.e. the perturbations that affect the system’s functioning, but which the system does not control. It is this perspective that led Maturana and Varela to define living systems as autopoietic, i.e. self-producing. Autopoiesis is achieved through organizational closure: the processes inside the system are organized in a circular manner, so that their output becomes part of their input and dynamics, and the different components and processes reconstitute each other. Self-maintenance can be seen as the ultimate goal, value, or end of a living system. For such natural systems, “the purpose of the system is what it does”, to use a famous expression coined by the cybernetician Stafford Beer. The system’s goal is not imposed by some intelligent designer, like in artificial or “allopoietic” systems. Its goal is intrinsic or implicit to the way the system functions: to continue functioning in the same way. Thus, a living system exemplifies a structure with emergent purpose: its components and processes are merely simple causal mechanisms; yet together they form an autonomous “agent” or “self”, i.e. an organizationally (but not thermodynamically) closed whole that acts so as to ensure its continued functioning.
>
> ... the emergence of goal-directed organizations from simple causal processes is neither mysterious nor improbable, but rather the natural outcome of an evolution that homes in on self-maintaining configurations, while selecting the ones with the greatest ability to survive a wide range of perturbations.

> CONCLUSION
>
> ... I then showed that goal-directedness is not only consistent with standard, “forward” causality, but that it complements such causal explanations by allowing us to predict the outcome of processes where complexity, stochasticity or external perturbations make step-by-step causal prediction impossible. For example, the assumption that a cheetah’s behavior is directed at the goal of feeding allows you to predict what will happen when the cheetah catches the gazelle it is chasing—no matter how complex and unpredictable the trajectory described by the running cheetah and gazelle.
>
> This feature of diverse and irregular trajectories predictably ending up in the same final state is known as equifinality. Related characteristics of goal-directedness have been formulated as plasticity (being able to reach the same goal under a variety of different circumstances), persistence (continuing to move towards the same goal in spite of perturbations) and negative feedback (neutralizing deviations from the goal by a compensating counteraction). A more complex characteristic is what I have called concerted action: the coordination of the activities of the different components of the system towards the goal.
>
> All of these features can be elegantly explained by means of a dynamical systems model of the goal-directed process. The dynamics of such a system commonly exhibits attractors: regions in the system’s state space to which all trajectories in the attractors’ basin converge, so that the attractor functions as the true “end” of the process. Perturbations are in this case automatically compensated by the dynamics, at least as long as they do not push the system outside of the basin. The attractor/goal does not need to be a fixed state (homeostasis), but can be a complex process that is circular (limit cycle) or ever advancing (homeorhesis).
>
> In order to differentiate a goal-directed system, such as a living organism, from a system that merely settles in a stable equilibrium, such as a ball ending up at the bottom of a bowl, I added the requirement that the attractor should correspond to a far-from-equilibrium configuration, i.e. one that requires input of energy in order to reach and maintain. That fits in with our general intuition of goal-directed agency as actively intervening in the world by mobilizing resources—rather than passively submitting to external forces.
>
> While such dynamical systems may provide a causal model of goal-directed behavior, this invites the question how systems could have originated that have the right configuration of causal processes to produce this kind of dynamics. To elucidate this, I briefly sketched the formal framework of Chemical Organization Theory, which starts from reactions (chemical and other) between resources as elementary causal processes. This framework shows how networks of such reactions tend to self-organize into attractors known as “organizations”, which are characterized by selfmaintenance and closure. Thus, organizations provide a simple and elegant model of the circular, self-producing dynamics that have been postulated in the theories of cybernetics, autopoiesis and autocatalytic cycles as the essence of autonomous agency, and thus of life. While this model requires a bit of abstract mathematics in order to demonstrate the otherwise counterintuitive notion that self-maintenance can emerge spontaneously, its elements, the reactions, represent concrete physical, chemical or biological processes.
>
> Yet, goal-directedness as I defined it, and life as we know it, require more than a self-maintaining configuration. That configuration should moreover be highly resilient, i.e. it should be able to recover from the wide variety of perturbations it is likely to encounter in a natural environment. That in turn requires that the corresponding attractor should be surrounded by a very extensive basin—a requirement equivalent to wide-ranging plasticity, persistence and concerted action..." - [The meaning and origin of goal-directedness: a dynamical systems perspective, by Francis Heylighen](https://cris.vub.be/ws/files/84393768/Goal_DirectednessBJLS_final.pdf)




metamodern sociology
maybe use this as an optional expandable section? or not...

> "And this is where metamodern sociology enters the picture. It begins from a similar move, one of further secularization. If postmodern sociology always posits that there are power structures controlling our behaviors and knowledge claims, metamodern sociology eschews even this belief. Rather, metamodern sociology begins from the proposition that power structures are only truly surface phenomena, shadows of a deeper and impersonal reality: the reality of complex emergences that crisscross one another. There are hence, ultimately, no power structures to “question” or even simply “remove”. Instead, there are processes that guide the emergence of the perspectives in the world, and this in turn guides behaviors and results.
>
> Because we cannot relate to society without taking a position based upon our perspective, the metamodern mind argues, we should own up to the perspective that we take, and the developmental direction implied by that view. We should then deliberately employ the sociological methods to shape society, its culture, institutions and economy, in this desired direction. This sense of direction is held, again, with sincere irony. We may know full well that our perspectives are limited and our visions partly imaginary, but we choose to take the risk, with informed naivety.
>
> Postmodernism can only ever be a critique of the existing modern society, affecting some patterns here and there. Metamodernism, as a movement and sentiment, seeks to suggest new paths for society altogether: a new overarching equilibrium. This has long been taboo in the social sciences. But it is time that the taboo is broken, and that creative minds use the sociological imagination to suggest concrete futures and make visible new potentials.
>
> In this sense, metamodern sociology marries the progressive impetus of modern sociology and its will to take modernity “as an object” that can be shaped and directed, to the multi-perspectival, deconstructive and “ironic” stance of postmodern sociology. This can, admittedly, be done in more or less fruitful manners. At worst, it is a shotgun wedding, where the worst of both worlds are combined – for instance, an undermining of scientic rigor in the name of relativism and unrealistic suggestions about a future utopia. At best, it is a nimble bifurcation between critique and progress, where new suggestions are carefully scrutinized and evolved. Or better yet, borrowing a term from quantum physics: metamodernism holds the modern idea of progress and the postmodern critique in superposition to one another – depending upon the participant perspective of the observer, each new inquiry can lead either to critique and resistance, or towards a path to deep progress.
>
> If modern sociology is about “reality”, the societal facts of the matter, and postmodern sociology is about “perspective”, the differing views of the facts of the matter, then metamodern sociology is about “potentials”, i.e. the larger realm of all possibilities contained within the multiplicity of mutually interacting perspectives. Metamodern sociology thus seeks to reorganize the generative conditions of how all of these perspectives emerge, evolve and interact.
>
> Modern sociology asks: What is society?
>
> Postmodern sociology asks: How is society viewed, by whom, and why?
>
> Metamodern sociology asks: How do these views of society emerge, and how can they be made to emerge in ways that are benecial from a multiplicity of weighted and compared views?
>
> The generative conditions of perspective in its necessary multiplicity. This is the ultimate object of study for a metamodern sociology. Metamodern sociology thus takes up the task of cataloging, understanding, comparing, and non-arbitrarily evaluating the many perspectives of society, self, and reality. The evaluation of perspectives is, of course, only something that can be done by having some over-arching meta-theory or larger conceptual space within which the perspectives can be placed in relation to one another. Hence, the metamodern divorce from the postmodern is completed: the postmodern mind would not have allowed for the formulation of an over-arching meta-theory, a narrative of narratives, a perspective of perspectives. And yet, this is what each metamodern sociologist must work on: a suggested map of meaning, one that can always evolve and be scrutinized by others – or “co-developed”.
>
> This map-making is, naturally, an enormous task that can never be concluded. But it is only through such a work that one can hope to suggest pathways for society which, for all future, will consist of many competing and contradicting perspectives. Deconstructing and critiquing perspectives of others, or even of oneself, cannot be enough. One must, sooner or later, reveal from which meta-theory one is working, and from there on say how and why the great multiplicity of perspectives can be evolved. This is a synthesis of modern and postmodern sociology; but as the metamodern mind also builds upon and attempts to transcend and include the postmodern perspective, it must always remain a proto-synthesis – i.e. not a synthesis held to describe the actual development of what Hegel called the world-soul, but a “good enough for now, safe enough to try” attempt to act in good faith. Hence, beyond its intellectual underpinnings, metamodern sociology is also an act of faith – of ironic piety – or even, if you will, of enlightened madness.
>
> Describing metamodern sociology...
>
> **Developmentalism of perspectives.** It is a tenet of metamodern sociology that perspectives are not arbitrarily ordered, but that they emerge in recognizable patterns. A poststructuralist critique of literature has never emerged in a tribal society with no writing; quantum theory has never emerged in a traditional, pre-modern, society. Even if strands of thought can be linked backwards in history (process philosophy back to Heraclitus and so forth), there are indeed specic ideas that build upon one another: multiplication builds upon addition. And these sequences are, in turn, always dependent upon social and material – ultimately, even biological – conditions, with which they interact. Postmodernism did not emerge before modernism, nor could it have. For this reason, metamodern sociology always looks for meaningful and explanatory developmental sequences, putting them into relation to one another on some kind of developmental scale. This developmentalism thus accepts at least some minimal form of stage theories; and these stage theories are not mere phases (childhood, maturity, old age) but indeed stages (addition, multiplication, power functions). Each stage must be, in clearly denable terms, either more complex than the former, or, at a minimum, be derived from the former and qualitatively distinct. For instance, one may study how people, such as police ofcers, think about an issue like “race and ethnicity”; some will reect upon these matters in simpler terms, “black people commit more crimes”, others in more nuanced and complex terms “some groups in society are underprivileged and are thus driven into crime more easily”, and some in yet more complex terms “through my work and perspective, I have a role in recreating the crime statistics that keep up the over-policing of some ethnic groups, which breeds exclusion and resentment in these groups”. In the minds of different observers with distinct perspectives, the same phenomenon appears differently, with different conclusions. These three suggested perspectives are not merely outcomes of different personalities, but they build upon one another: there is a developmental sequence – and if more police ofcers are supported to independently being able to think in accordance with the more complex perspective, this is likely to be more aligned with their dealings with the complexities of society and criminal justice. To eschew all developmental sequences of such perspectives is to atten the view, as it were, projecting a three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional surface. This is what the metamodern sociologist calls “developmental blindness”. Unfortunately, postmodern sociology is more or less developmentally blind, which explains a large part of its impotence to create workable pathways for culture and society to take.
>
> **Meta-theory and map-making**. It is another unfortunate limitation to contemporary sociology that students are not taught comprehensive maps of the theoretical landscape of sociological theories, so that choice of theory and perspective can be selected non-arbitrarily, with well-argued motivations. There is a severe lack of meta-theory. Rather, the choice of theory, and indeed, the entirety of academic careers, are based upon which theories happen to “speak to” the individual scholar, often being dened by earlier work on the particular topic of study. Sociologists become “interactionists”, “constructivist feminists”, “Marxists”, “middle-range theory institutionalists” and so forth, depending upon whim and chance, often unable to communicate meaningfully across these sub-disciplinary boundaries. This is an enormous waste of potential, as the meta-theoretical space is sub-optimized. To be fair, prominent sociologists like Jeffrey Alexander and Georg Ritzer have indeed presented meta-theoretical maps of the territory, but these have not taken a central place in the education of sociologists, and a researcher is generally not expected to give convincing reasons for his or her position within a larger meta-theoretical map. Neither do a few courses on the “philosophy of social science” grant students a comprehensive map, as these also simply enumerate a host of competing positions. Metamodern sociology is different: It begins and ends in meta-theory, always naming the underlying meta-theory, one’s own theoretical position within it, and always returning to the metatheoretical map once the theoretical and empirical dive is concluded, feeding something back to this fundamental “ground-level” of social science. A good place to start is Ken Wilber’s comprehensive work on “integral theory”, which includes several important meta-theoretical maps – but it is a telling sign that one must look to relatively esoteric writers beyond the discipline, like Wilber, to nd good material for such mappings. In short, the emergence of the many perspectives in sociology and its large body of theories is not arbitrary; it covers different aspects of injunctions into the nature of society. If there is any one thing that particularly prevents sociology as an academic discipline from becoming a proper “science”, it is this lack of meta-theoretical maps – all the perspectives and injunctions end up beings “smashed together” in a grand, confusing hotchpotch. By going to the source, to the map-making of the sociological territory, one can begin to restore order to this cosmos, and thus specify which truth claims are relevant as basic tenets of each form of injunction, ridding the landscape of redundant and contradictory theories. Metamodern sociology must thus work from a more highly abstracted and complex level, zooming in on different phenomena from different theoretical perspectives, all the time explicating why and how each zoom is made. Naturally, one’s meta-theoretical map – if you will, one’s underlying paradigm made explicit – will also shape one’s view of what society is and how it functions.
>
> ...
>
> To conclude, sociology and metamodernism both share a key concern: to take modern society “as an object” that can be described, interpreted, related to, and ultimately reshaped; both entities work to see through and go beyond the modern. Hence, the argument can be made, that metamodernism belongs at the heart of the future of the sociological discipline, i.e. a sociology true to its own promises must become metamodern in its perspective – and, conversely, that sociology belongs at the heart of metamodernism. When metamodernism attempts to assert itself as a new self-organizing principle of society, it must be able to “see” modernity as the substrate upon which it operates. This follows, as the reader may have noticed, the pattern of subject-object theory: that with which one was earlier identied and took for granted, one’s “subject”, becomes an “object of awareness” from the new and higher vantage point — higher, of course, according to one’s developmentally informed meta-theory." - [An Open Invitation to a Metamodern Sociology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/an-open-invitation-to-a-metamodern-sociology/)

> "Modernism, so conceived, is a bankrupt paradigm. Yes, we can be nuanced, and should be, recognizing that it also brought with it many emancipations, cured many ills and diseases, added many comforts and luxuries, and generally allowed people the opportunity to explore self-actualization as they never could before. For these reasons, metamodernism embraces and takes up the genuine insights of modernism into its worldview. But it also takes up its postmodern critique, which is valid and urgently necessary. For, as we speak, the very suburban wastelands I’ve just described are still spreading, growing, “developing” across the globe. Indeed, is not the meta-crisis itself the cancer created by this modernist metastasis?" - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/post/reflections-on-the-dawn-of-everything#:~:text=Modernism%2C%20so%20conceived,this%20modernist%20metastasis%3F)

> "So, we have four major schools of normative ethics: rule-based ethics, contractualism, virtue-based ethics, and consequentialism. Each, I would claim, come with its own validity claim:
>
> • **The validity claim of rule-based ethics** is that an action has to be in accordance with universal principles that can be justied a priori and deduced from self-evident premises derived from the action itself in order to be considered ethically valid—ultimately regardless of context.
>
> • **Contractualism’s validity claim** is that the rules regulating our conduct have to be based on a priori principles that must be mutually agreed upon by reference to the relationship between actors in order to be considered ethically valid.
>
> • **The validity claim of virtue-based ethics** is that an action cannot merely be judged as good or bad in itself, but what matters is the moral character of the agent which can only be judged a posteriori, and then only by reference to a description of the action or property itself viewed through the lens of its particular social context.
>
> • **Consequentialism’s validity claim** is that actions can only be considered ethically valid if the outcome of these a posteriori happen to have preferable consequences overall, and then only by reference to some collective end based on the relationship between all actors.
>
> ... It should be obvious by now that “taking sides” regarding which school of ethics to follow is a foolish endeavor. The same can be said of any impulse to entirely discard one or more of the schools. Obviously, all four schools have important perspectives to offer. But the question still remains how exactly to use them and how to manage and reconcile their differences. Just knowing about the four schools and how they t into the fours quadrants does not in itself sufce to resolve ethical paradoxes. In the following I will attempt to show not just how the four schools complement each other, but also how they depend on each other and ultimately collapse into each other.
>
> ... The reason that we are still wrestling with the same ethical dilemmas century after century is that we have been accustomed to assuming that the world of ethics is at; that a linear logic permeates the world of normative ethics, so when you reach the end of a world corner (the place where you hit philosophical bedrock), you simply fall of the edge. But the world of ethics is not at. It is round, spherical. Or, rather, toroidal (donut-ical). The moment you hit the edge of one world corner, you end up at the beginning of another. We all need to stop being ethical atearthers. We must all become ethical donuts." - [A Four-Dimensional Fractal Approach to Ethics, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/a-four-dimensional-fractal-approach-to-ethics/)

> "Nations, religions, cults, gangs, subcultures, fraternal societies, internet communities, political parties, social movements – these are all really different, but they also have some deep similarities. They’re all groups of people. They all combine comradery within the group with a tendency to dislike other groups of the same type. They all tend to have a stated purpose, like electing a candidate or worshipping a deity, but also serve a very important role as impromptu social clubs whose members mostly interact with one another instead of outsiders. They all develop an internal culture such that members of the groups often like the same foods, wear the same clothing, play the same sports, and have the same philosophical beliefs as other members of the group – even when there are only tenuous links or no links at all to the stated purpose. They all tend to develop sort of legendary histories, where they celebrate and exaggerate the deeds of the groups’ founders and past champions. And they all tend to inspire something like patriotism, where people are proud of their group membership and express that pride through conspicuous use of group symbols, group songs, et cetera. For better or worse, the standard way to refer to this category of thing is “tribe”.

> ... If you take only one thing from this essay, it’s that communities are best understood not logically but historically. If you want to understand the Shia, don’t reflect upon the true meaning of Ali being the rightful caliph, understand that a dispute involving Ali initiated ethnogenesis, the resulting culture picked up a bunch of features and became useful to various people, and now here we are. If you want to understand the rationalist community, don’t ask exactly how near you have to think the singularity has to be before you qualify for membership, focus on the fact that some stuff Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote led to certain people identifying themselves as “rationalists” and for various reasons I enjoy dinner parties with those people about 10000% more interesting than dinner parties with randomly selected individuals. nostalgebraist actually summed this up really well: “Maybe the real rationalism was the friends we made along the way.” Maybe that’s the real Shia Islam too, and the real Democratic Party, and so on.

> ... 5. Religious Literalism: One comment complaint I heard during the height of the Atheist-Theist Online Wars was that atheists were a lot like fundamentalists. Both wanted to interpret the religious texts in the most literal possible way. Being on the atheist side of these wars, I always wanted to know: well, why wouldn’t you? Given that the New Testament clearly says you have to give all your money to the poor, and the Old Testament doesn’t say anything about mixing meat and milk, maybe religious Christians should start giving everything to the poor and religious Jews should stop worrying so much about which dishes to use when? But I think this is the same mistake as treating the Sunni as an organization dedicated to promoting an Abu Bakr caliphate. The holy book is the rallying flag for a religion, but the religion is not itself about the holy book. The rallying flag created a walled-off space where people could undergo the development process and create an independent culture. That independent culture may diverge significantly from the holy book. I think that very neurotypical people naturally think in terms of tribes, and the idea that they have to retool their perfectly functional tribe to conform to the exact written text of its holy book or constitution or stated political ideology or something seems silly to them. I think that less neurotypical people – a group including many atheists – think less naturally in terms of tribes and so tend to take claims like “Christianity is about following the Bible” at face value. But Christianity is about being part of the Christian tribe, and although that tribe started around the Bible, maintains its coherence because of the Bible, and is of course naturally influenced by it, if it happens to contradict the Bible in some cases that’s not necessarily surprising or catastrophic. This is also why I’m not really a fan of debates over whether Islam is really “a religion of peace” or “a religion of violence”, especially if those debates involve mining the Quran for passages that support one’s preferred viewpoint. It’s not just because the Quran is a mess of contradictions with enough interpretive degrees of freedom to prove anything at all. It’s not even because Islam is a host of separate cultures as different from one another as Unitarianism is from the Knights Templar. It’s because the Quran just created the space in which the Islamic culture could evolve, but had only limited impact on that evolution...
>
> ... My title for this post is also my preferred summary: the ideology is not the movement. Or, more jargonishly – the rallying flag is not the tribe. People are just trying to find a tribe for themselves and keep it intact. This often involves defending an ideology they might not be tempted to defend for any other reason. This doesn’t make them bad, and it may not even necessarily mean their tribe deserves to go extinct. I’m reluctant to say for sure whether I think it’s okay to maintain a tribe based on a faulty ideology, but I think it’s at least important to understand that these people are in a crappy situation with no good choices, and they deserve some pity. Some vital aspects of modern society – freedom of speech, freedom of criticism, access to multiple viewpoints, the existence of entryist tribes with explicit goals of invading and destroying competing tribes as problematic, and the overwhelming pressure to dissolve into the Generic Identity Of Modern Secular Consumerism – make maintaining tribal identities really hard these days. I think some of the most interesting sociological questions revolve around whether there are any ways around the practical and moral difficulties with tribalism, what social phenomena are explicable as the struggle of tribes to maintain themselves in the face of pressure, and whether tribalism continues to be a worthwhile or even a possible project at all." - [The Ideology Is Not The Movement | Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/)

> "The core concept of Soros’ worldview is that the human mind is an inextricable part of the world that it models. There are two key takeaways that can be derived from this: firstly, mental models of the world affect the state of the world, in what he calls the principle of reflexivity. Secondly, the human mind cannot perceive ultimate truths, so its models are based on incomplete information which is “bound to be either biased or inconsistent or both,” which Soros calls the principle of fallibility. These principles are lifted almost directly from Popper’s work, which argues that empirical truths can never be known with absolute certainty. This innate human uncertainty means that states of true equilibrium, in which subjective mental models correspond to objective reality, are rare. Instead, the basic state of all institutions is disequilibrium.
>
> Since biased and inaccurate mental models are perpetuated socially, any group consensus will necessarily contain misconceptions. The result is an epistemic bubble, and in Soros’ conception these are increasingly unstable the more they diverge from reality. For example, boom and bust cycles in real estate follow this basic pattern. When real estate prices are rising, banks will ease lending standards and allow low introductory interest rates for real estate loans in order to get more customers to buy, which in turn appreciates the price of real estate further. During a boom period it is relatively easy to refinance debt, allowing homeowners to reduce their mortgage payments. But the more the bubble inflates, the more disconnected the market is from reality; home prices do not correspond to their material worth, but instead what the market thinks they are worth. When that bubble bursts, it creates a cascade of feedback in the opposite direction.
>
> The U.S. housing crisis during the mid-2000s shows this theory in action: in a loosely regulated real estate market, subprime lending and adjustable-rate mortgages made home ownership achievable for borrowers during the real estate boom, so long as they were willing to incur debt. But when overvalued housing prices began to decline, it became more difficult for borrowers to refinance their loans, and low introductory interest rates were reset to prohibitively high ones. The result was that homes that had already been purchased became unaffordable for the purchasers, and the resultant foreclosures and mortgage defaults created global economic effects as mortgage-backed securities lost their value. According to Soros, this is why market fundamentalism is a faulty system. A market cannot self-correct when it is in this state, since the participants themselves are driving its behavior away from equilibrium. Instead, markets overshoot or undershoot real conditions to an unsustainable degree, and the boom and bust cycle is the result.
>
> Reflexivity also occurs politically. Since all human perception is subjective, there can be no political ideology in possession of the objective truth. Soros cites communism and fascism as political systems that make this false claim, which Popper did as well. Furthermore, politics are prone to the same cycles of disequilibrium that economics are. As early as 2003, at the peak of America’s Bush-era interventionist fervor, Soros stated that U.S. dominance in global politics and trade was reflexive, in that applications of military and financial might encouraged greater and greater use of those same policies to the point where they became unsustainable. Ultimately, Soros predicted both the 2008 recession and the failures of U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan with the same theoretical framework.
>
> Soros holds that an “open society,” a concept borrowed from Popper, can reduce the severity of reflexivity. In an open society, people are free to hold differing opinions without repression, and it is openly acknowledged that no person or group can be in possession of the ultimate truth, including the government. If disequilibrium grows in such a society, it can be addressed early through planned interventions before it becomes the dominant state. Closed societies can be transformed into open societies through subversions of dominant authority, and once opened, they need to be maintained and protected or else they may backslide into closed societies, which are characterized by their repression. Soros established OSF in 1979 to help these tenets take root in nations with either repressive governments or recently-installed democracies. OSF projects have included researching economic reform in 1980s China, funding scholarships for Black students in apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa, and expanding cultural centers and scientific research in Russia before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
>
> Soros is aware that ideological threats to open societies are pervasive. He has made mostly correct predictions about populist strongmen assuming power soon after a democratic government is installed in previously authoritarian states. Soros’ thoughts on Iraq in 2004 held true for Afghanistan in 2021, having stated that the transfer of power from the U.S. to local militias “prepares the ground for religious and ethnic divisions and possible civil war in the manner of Bosnia rather than Western-style democracy.” He has since seen his native Hungary swing toward authoritarianism despite the establishment of a democratic government in 1989. Though Popper’s conception of open societies conflated democracy with a greater understanding of reality, Soros has found that “it may not be necessary to gain a better understanding of reality in order to obtain the laws one wants. There is a shortcut: 'spinning' arguments and manipulating public opinion to get the desired results. Today our political discourse is primarily concerned with getting elected and staying in power.” Populism and nationalism may be the greatest threats to open societies, and as Soros has seen in post-Soviet Russia, in Hungary, and in the U.S. during the war on terror, there is great potential for authoritarian ideals to take hold within democracies.
>
> Soros’ shifting view of market capitalism has also tempered the initial optimism of the open society project. Though Popper did not specifically associate the open society with democracy or capitalism, interpretations of his work implicitly conflate open societies with liberal democracies, drawing on the notion that liberal democracies are the most open of extant societal models. The open but regulated market is a key feature of liberal democracies. But Soros predicted earlier than most theorists the drawbacks of globalized free market capitalism after the fall of the Soviet Union, theorizing that social Darwinism, coupled with trust in the invisible hand of the free market, would ultimately lead to geopolitical and social strife. Soros cites the dearth of empathy and integration attempts afforded to post-Soviet states by the EU in the 1990s, driven by a Western individualist view that other countries should be left to their own affairs. He further notes that public aid projects like the Marshall Plan could legitimately foster growth, whereas infusions of private capital more often consolidated power in the hands of an oligarchic elite.
>
> This realization has led him to somewhat distrust the systems that allowed him to accrue and deploy his fortune, but not enough to propose abandoning them entirely. Instead, Soros has stated that participants in capitalist democracies should “separate their role as market participants from their role as political participants,” further framing the market as a platform for self-interest and politics as a platform for public interest. This distinction however cannot be cleanly applied to the U.S. context where economic and political decisions are often deeply entangled. Soros seems to believe that he is overly enmeshed in a system that prevents a true open society from taking root, but has struggled to formulate a cohesive compromise.
>
> The open society is a cosmopolitan, internationalist ideal born out of Soros’ upbringing. Soros has been clear that he cannot divorce his progressivism from his experiences as a Jew, which not only include the persecutions of WWII, but also take his family’s educated, secular background into account. Soros specifically values societies that do not pressure minority groups to assimilate the way his family did. In practice, open societies are perpetuated through their cultural hubs, typically universities and publishers, but in his conception these are not means of winning the hearts of the public, but are instead the training grounds of what will eventually become the new elite classes. His beliefs can read as overly pedagogical or even bourgeois depending on the political context, and it is for that reason that the open societies project has considerable ideological negotiation to do before it can have mainstream appeal.
>
> Ultimately, Soros is caught between two ideological structures: the capitalist society that allows him to amass and maintain power, and the open society that espouses a global collectivism contrary to his position as an individual, private funder of societal reform. This may be the reason that attempts at extending open society values into existing political institutions have been ineffective. As a result, Soros’ unique progressivism may end up as a footnote of democratic ideology instead of a foundational theory.
>
> ... The exaggeration of Soros’ influence on Hungarian statehood has parallels in right-wing political discourse globally. Soros is frequently made out to be the mastermind of a globalist conspiracy to undermine national sovereignty, an accusation which draws on anti-Semitic tropes. The Turkish and Polish governments have similarly used Soros as a figurehead to further their protectionist rhetoric, which forced OSF to cease operating in Turkey in 2018. In the U.S., Soros is frequently a scapegoat for right-wing extremists. While it is the case that a full realization of Soros’ policy recommendations would likely entail open borders, which nationalist contingents would logically fear, the exaggeration of Soros’ influence is a product of him being one of the few players on the far left who is able to mobilize significant money toward progressive causes. Still, as much as Soros is able to act unilaterally to distribute humanitarian aid, in terms of policy his progressivism largely gets subsumed in favor of centrist Democratic liberalism. Soros does not play well with existing political institutions, partially due to OSF’s standing as a nonprofit, but also due to personal preference. He has referred to himself as a “political neophyte” and mostly interfaces with the U.S. Democratic party through think tanks and PACs. He is as bothered by partisan appeals from the left as he is from the right, and this leads him to distrust direct political involvement in a general sense.

> Having watched early democratic projects give way to populism, Soros has tempered his optimism for the global democratic project, noting that “democracies suffer from a deficiency of values…[and] are notoriously unwilling to take any pain when their vital self-interests are not directly threatened.” The “global system of political decision-making” that Soros initially envisioned seems prohibitively gauche. Soros was somewhat correct to focus on the elite classes as drivers of social change, but a democracy is founded on the will of the public, and cosmopolitan, liberal democrats cultivated by a Western elite are not a representative sample of the public. As Soros seems to have learned the hard way, if you don’t win the hearts of the majority, someone else will.
>
> ... Soros’ involvement in U.S. politics was minimal until the early 2000s. Angered by the Bush administration’s use of the war on terror to justify the repression of free speech, he began to donate extensively to Democratic presidential candidates, including John Kerry. He helped found the Democracy Alliance after Bush’s reelection, a network of influential and progressive voters who are expected to contribute at least $200,000 annually to the Alliance’s chosen causes. After supporting Obama’s presidential campaign, Soros attempted to maneuver into an advisory role with the administration but was shut down. He was later one of the largest supporters of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Soros has not cultivated live players within the Democratic Party who have nuanced understandings of his views. He conceptualizes his relationship with the Democratic Party as a transactional one, likely because he is aware that his progressivism is at odds with the centrist Democratic position that sustains the party, but is afraid that a shift toward conservatism under a Republican government would deeply harm the U.S.’ position as a global representative of functional democracy. He continues to float vast sums of money toward his chosen candidates and causes, and these are never spurned, but the Democratic Party is oriented toward upholding the status quo rather than reforming institutions for George Soros’ conception of openness, and remains ambivalent about the influence of the billionaire class. In 2019, Soros created the Democracy PAC to influence the 2020 election, donating $28.3 million. Funds received by the PAC go toward Democratic candidates or programs to mobilize Democratic voters. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Soros has donated another $125 million to the PAC, noting that this is a “long-term investment” and that coordination would be handed off to his son, Alexander Soros. This wording is telling; it appears that Soros is stepping down from active involvement, and has awarded Democracy PAC its inheritance.
>
> ... Whether due to age, disillusionment, or institutional capture, Soros has been putting fewer resources into unique geopolitical action and more into conventional Democratic politics. His many efforts to pass on his worldview have not produced a successor with the nuanced understanding necessary to duplicate his goals or methods. Instead, Soros’ successors both in the Open Society Foundation and in his family will most likely follow mainstream Democratic approaches in service of mainstream Democratic goals. In the end, Soros is aware that as a public figure he has no direct contemporaries. When asked to describe his ideology in 2018, Soros responded: “my ideology is nonideological. I’m in the club of nonclubs.” This, perhaps, is his greatest shortcoming. The uniqueness of Soros’ thinking was a great economic asset, since it meant there were few if any competitors who thought as Soros did. This same ideological uniqueness made it challenging to deploy funds. When it comes to organizations, staffing is policy. If the people who understand or are committed to a reform program are too rare to staff organizations, funding becomes an inefficient means of pursuing the desired social reform. This paradox is an unsolved challenge for independently-minded individuals wishing to use wealth to reshape society." - [The Legacy of George Soros’ Open Society, Bismark Analysis](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-legacy-of-george-soros-open-society)


> "The IMF is, in theory, a technocratic institution and its management consists of professional economists. But, in practice, lending is heavily influenced by the interests and foreign policy goals of its wealthiest and largest members, particularly the United States.
>
> ... As a result, the apparently unsustainable domestic policies of politically-favored debtor governments remain unchanged, since government elites know that they will always be able to borrow cheaply from the Fund. In addition, the IMF’s technocrats have often imposed overly complex or fast-paced reform programs that fall apart in the face of domestic political opposition. This, in turn, often leads to political unrest and continued economic weakness in the recipient nations, which in turn perpetuates their dependence on the Fund. From the viewpoint of the IMF’s major donors, however, this continued dependence may be more of a feature than a bug. As long as the technocratic approach continues to fail, the Fund functions as a source of free money for a country’s government elites in exchange for following U.S. or Western European foreign policy preferences.
>
> ... From the viewpoint of the recipients, Chinese loans may be viewed as more desirable than IMF financing. Lower conditionality allows existing elites to avoid disrupting delicate domestic intra-elite and electoral bargains. China is also willing to take in-kind payments in return for loans, such as natural resources or concessions to exploit natural resources, which the IMF is not. As the world’s largest manufacturer, China’s need for these natural resources is very real. The IMF, in other words, asks its loan recipients to potentially compromise their sovereignty through serial reliance on its funding, while China is more interested in acquiring their assets. At least some Chinese lending clearly functions as a substitute for the IMF, notably in oil-exporting countries. Angola, for instance, abandoned talks with the IMF in 2004 after securing oil-backed loans from China.
>
> This pattern of lending means that China is often accused of “debt-trap diplomacy” by U.S. policymakers and commentators, but given the mixed empirical evidence for the economic benefits of IMF programs and the fact that conditionality can itself lead to domestic political disruptions and long-term debt traps, it is not clear which lender even a purely neutral and self-interested government should prefer. Chinese infrastructure investments may be preferred to austerity programs, especially since the latter by themselves can help to stimulate economic activity and help to manage debt-to-GDP ratios through growth.
>
> Argentina, Pakistan and Egypt are all themselves arguably caught in a debt trap to the U.S., through their dependence on the IMF. China has also proved willing to restructure debts when needed, allowing Kenya to postpone payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and taking debt reductions on loans to the Maldives and Malaysia. In no case did China demand that the borrowing states relinquish strategic assets in exchange for debt relief, as would be expected if it were pursuing a deliberate debt-trap diplomacy strategy. In the worst case scenario, whether long-term financial reliance on the IMF or ceding economic assets to Chinese ownership is worse for sovereignty and development is an open question.
>
> If China’s economy continues to grow and its lending continues to scale accordingly, its lending is likely to reach sufficient volumes to have meaningful effects on the IMF’s behavior. The future may be a global competition for strategic lending, rather than the near-monopoly the Fund has enjoyed until now. In such context, loan conditionality is likely to grow even weaker, and the ability of the U.S. to deploy its financial resources to corral its allies may become weaker than has historically been the case. Despite the rise of China as a lender, however, it is very unlikely to entirely replace the IMF’s role, especially in countries without substantial natural resources or where China has no plausible strategic interest. But there will be even greater pressure to reduce the IMF’s technocratic actions and goals in favor of still more loans driven by U.S. foreign policy considerations and strategic competition with China." - [The IMF’s Role As a Foreign Policy Tool, Bismark Analysis](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-imfs-role-as-a-foreign-policy)


> "**ESG Hacks the Bureaucracy**
>
> ESG works by taking advantage of the increasing bureaucratization of the modern investment industry. In the 1980s and earlier, investment and finance were industries relatively dense with live players... But starting in the late 1980s and 1990s, the excesses of the industry would be curbed by regulators, not least through a series of fraud and insider trading investigations. In the 1990s, academic finance emerged as a discipline.
>
> Academic finance had its origins in the 1960s but was mainly concerned with technical means to optimize portfolios. In the 1990s, the discipline started to lay down quantitative criteria by which investments could be evaluated. Academics published papers on what specific strategies could reliably beat average market returns. In response to this, investment professionals became increasingly obsessed with beating these benchmarks. This has become known as “generating alpha” in the industry.
>
> In theory the academicization of the finance industry should have given rise to more robustness and formality in the practices of the professionals that work there. Whether it achieved this or not is an open question. But what it certainly did was generate norms out of which an enormous bureaucracy developed. Every investment now had to have an analyst, a portfolio manager, a risk manager above the portfolio manager, perhaps a portfolio optimizer on hand to control even more risk. Such an organizational structure becomes increasingly focused on minimizing risk and “optimizing” returns and far less focused on investment as it has been traditionally practiced.
>
> ESG effectively hacks this bureaucratic structure, by adding another layer on top of the bureaucratic hierarchy. This layer ensures that even if an investment idea makes its way up the hierarchy of financial professionals, from the analyst to the portfolio manager and past the risk management system, it will now encounter the head of ESG. This additional bureaucracy will, in theory, now screen the investment based on its impact on society and the environment. If the investment is judged poorly, it can be tossed aside, despite otherwise being judged to be a solid investment.
>
> ESG relies on the proliferation of quantitative metrics that have created the tremendous bureaucracy that now constitutes most of the financial industry. But quantitative metrics counterintuitively have a tendency to give rise to nonsense and irrationality, since it is easier to invent new quantitative metrics than it is to ensure they accurately measure something real. ESG is a good example of this, since there is no standardized method of measuring environmental, social, and corporate governance.
>
> When it comes to measuring something like carbon dioxide emissions, for example, creating a metric is straightforward enough. So long as companies are not trying to mislead regulators, they can simply report the amount of carbon dioxide they are releasing. It’s worth noting that even in this straightforward case, major corporations have in fact attempted to mislead regulators with great effort on basic concrete metrics. From 2009 to 2015, Germany’s Volkswagen, the second largest automobile manufacturer in the world, intentionally programmed the diesel engines in its vehicles to activate carbon dioxide emissions controls only during laboratory testing with regulators.
>
> Nevertheless, ESG goes far beyond these sorts of easily measurable categories and in doing so becomes far vaguer and more nebulous. For example, ESG is concerned with corporate impacts on biodiversity and habitats. But how do you measure this? The world’s agricultural industry, for example, relies on pollinating insects, which are by many accounts in serious decline. But the multitude of factors contributing to this problem, including changes in land use, pesticide use, climate change, and more, are nearly impossible to quantify, let alone assign portions of blame to individual companies.
>
> The problem with using measurements this vague is that they effectively become subjective. If this were the case, it would introduce a lot of uncertainty into what ESG is actually measuring and would cast doubt on any claims made by its proponents. For example, one study by researchers from MIT has shown that this is precisely the case when examining ESG ratings promulgated by prominent financial ratings agencies like S&P Global and Moody’s. Massive divergences in ratings mean that one agency might give a company a score of “-2,” while another might give that same company a score of “+2.”
>
> There is a positive correlation between ratings, which is intended to give assurance that the ratings tend to measure something real. But this correlation is likely more explicable by professional consensus between ratings analysts rather than independent empirical confirmation of a company’s impact on society and the environment. The authors of the study note that “ESG rating divergence is not merely a matter of varying definitions, but a fundamental disagreement about the underlying data.” Since ESG is becoming an investment criterion, this is hardly a robust metric.
>
> Despite these problems, proponents of ESG investing argue that ESG investment is not just morally right, but outperforms ordinary investment and generates higher returns. On the face of it, ESG does generate alpha reliably. A representative example is a meta-study from NYU Stern, which was sponsored by Rockefeller Asset Management and surveyed over 1000 studies published between 2015 and 2020. Examining the impact of ESG compliance on both company performance and financial returns for investors, the study concluded that “very few studies” found a negative correlation between ESG and financial performance.
>
> The study concluded that “for investors seeking to construct portfolios that generate alpha, some ESG strategies seem to generate market rate or excess returns when compared to conventional investment strategies, especially for long-term investors, and provide downside protection during economic or social crisis.” This optimistic conclusion was somewhat belied by the study’s own data, which found that 58% of studies examining companies showed a positive impact of having a high ESG score, but only 33% of studies examining investments.
>
> The sheer number of ESG studies being published suggests there are financial incentives at play. Between 2015 and 2020, an average of two hundred studies on ESG and company performance were published every year. Researchers are most likely being paid to generate these studies; the meta-study was itself financed by Rockefeller Asset Management. When studies are being financed in such large volumes, their results become suspect, especially given the wide disparity in findings. Statistical studies of this sort are not hard to hack, whether intentionally or unintentionally. When it is done unintentionally, the researcher tends to focus on the methodology that produces the correct result. So, for example, if they are inclined toward getting a positive result and they get a negative result, they may go back and revise the methodology; but if they immediately achieve a positive result, they will not re-examine the methodology.
>
> Just as quantitative metrics lead to a proliferation of bureaucracy, a potentially lucrative investment field will generate a proliferation of research funding cascading in one direction. While the authors of these studies may be well-meaning, if your ESG study is being financed by an investment company that is benefitting from ESG investing it is not in your interest to generate results that strongly discredit ESG. Your report may not be published, and you are unlikely to get more research funding in your next round.
>
> There is a tremendous disparity between the amount of research done on ESG and investment returns or corporate financial performance, and the amount of research done on the actual outcomes ESG produces. Upwards of two hundred papers are being published per year to examine the impact of ESG on financial performance. In contrast, there is almost no research done on ESG-driven outcomes on society or the environment, which is, in theory, the entire original purpose of ESG. The key reason for this is likely related to the measurement issue with ESG: it is not altogether clear what ESG measures, so it is doubly difficult to try to discern if these measures are increasing or decreasing.
>
> ... According to one study from Harvard Business School, “only a small portion of ESG metrics entering the evaluation of ESG raters is outcomes.” Rather, most of the metrics being evaluated are “policies, principles, management systems, targets, and disclosures.” To the extent that the ratings do focus on outcomes, these tend to be even more difficult to measure. Another Harvard study found that outcome-based metrics generate even more disagreement across ratings agencies than metrics based on evaluating policies, or “input metrics.” The result is that ESG ratings are essentially measuring the theoretical impact on society and the environment of various policies that companies issue, rather than any concrete outcome for society or the environment, and they are unable to agree even on this.
>
> Finally, although not well studied, initial findings suggest that at least some prominent index funds with an ESG mandate rarely vote in line with their stated preferences. For example, Vanguard Social Index Fund has been shown to have voted against almost all the environmental and social resolutions put forward between 2010 and 2019. Their track record on “governance” issues is slightly more mixed, but they have tended to vote against these. Others like the BlackRock DSI ETF have voted more consistently in favor of ESG, so this shows another point of divergence between interpretations of ESG mandates.
>
> What these initial studies seem to suggest is that ESG is mainly about companies advertising that they are engaged in the consensus of responsible business practices. This costs the companies nothing beyond what it costs to create and distribute the marketing material or announce new policies in the workplace. But when adhering to responsible business practices that look like they might harm the bottom line, it appears that ESG proponents vote against them.
>
> **A Bureaucratized Industry is a Controllable Industry**
>
> Perhaps the best way to think about ESG is that it is not about corporate governance. Rather, it serves two purposes. For corporations, it is a form of marketing that is undertaken to improve the public image of the company in question. For investors, it is about opening a very large and profitable space in which quantitative investors can try to find new “factors” that generate “alpha.” Corporations are clearly signing on for the positive public relations boost. But this is not exactly what investors are doing. They are engaged in something different and more subtle.
>
> The proliferation of bureaucracy in the field of investing has given rise to inertia. Investors are becoming increasingly skeptical that highly paid investment managers can generate alpha. There are plenty of popular books showing that the coveted investment alpha is shrinking by the year. Investors argue amongst themselves why this is the case. Some claim that the industry has become overly corporate and bureaucratic, while others argue that competition has squeezed the markets dry of reliable excess returns. Professional investors are having a harder and harder time justifying their own existence.
>
> Enter ESG, a poorly defined, but highly regarded field of inquiry with a lot of institutional money behind it. Because the usual research rules of quantitative finance do not seem to apply in ESG, it becomes a playground for quantitative investors. The slew of studies, mostly financed by the financial industry itself, seems to show that investing in ESG will not only give you excess returns but will also make the world a better place. It is perhaps unsurprising then that this new field is taking over a large part of the capital markets.
>
> For the financial industry, ESG is not appealing because of a genuine desire to improve outcomes for society and the environment. While investment professionals doubtlessly have a genuine desire to do this, the appeal of ESG is rather that it is a new but easily fudgeable metric that can be used to internally justify the existence of many jobs and careers. The proliferation of ESG is then primarily a consequence of the bureaucratization of finance and investment, rather than its own unique merits.
>
> As a result, even if ESG eventually falls out of fashion, one can expect the proliferation of new, similar metrics that serve the same function. These might be justified on similar ideological grounds as ESG in terms of fighting climate change and increasing diversity, but they could also be justified on other grounds entirely. In a future, more technocratic China, for example, ambitious financial professionals might attempt to justify metrics that rate the degree to which a company or investment adheres to Xi Jinping Thought.
>
> For political players, such as the bureaucracies of the United Nations, the appeal of ESG is that it creates a vector with which to influence the deployment of capital both on global markets and within large companies. The vagueness of ESG and the ease with which financial professionals can fudge it would seem to indicate that this is a weak vector for influence. For now, it probably is. But introducing such metrics is only one step in a long process. The vagueness of ESG basically functions as a loophole in a new but informal regulatory framework for business and investment.
>
> Once economic players have already accepted this framework and are benefitting from the loophole, the next step for political players is to introduce a rigorous standard for ESG, something that is difficult to oppose if framed as a way of formalizing consensus and making metrics more reliable. But this new standard will not be defined by financial professionals, but by political players. For example, experts affiliated with the UN might formulate and promote a new way to standardize ESG metrics, which will eventually be adopted in substance by a U.S. financial regulatory institution. As a result, there will be new justifications for political players to intervene much more aggressively in business and investment, on the grounds of enforcing adherence to the new standard, which everyone has already de facto accepted.
>
> ESG has become both a product of and a fig leaf for massively increased bureaucracy in the field of investment. ESG is a result of the academic quantitative finance revolution that turned investment finance from a frontier where live players made their fortunes to an established industry managed by bureaucrats and computer algorithms. As returns continue to fall on average, ESG has proven to be a useful model for these bureaucrats to justify their jobs. If you can’t beat the market, your best bet is to promise to change the world. But once you are changing the world, you are no longer just a financial professional, but a political worker as well." - [How ESG Takes Advantage of Bureaucratic Finance, Bismark Analysis](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/how-esg-takes-advantage-of-bureaucratic)


> "While the majority of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) outstanding loans are used to shore up the state finances of a few large and strategically-relevant countries such as Argentina, Pakistan, Egypt, and Ukraine, the World Bank is a much more dispersed operation, with funding spread more broadly and evenly among poor countries. Like the IMF, it also functions as an economic policy and global development think tank, and much of its work with low-income nations involves policy advice. Although the IMF and World Bank both loan large sums of money to the vast majority of middle-income and low-income governments, there is a difference between their purposes: the IMF’s lending is intended to avert insolvency and political instability caused by financial crises, whereas the World Bank’s lending is intended to continuously spur growth and development over the long term.
>
> The World Bank, however, largely fails to do this, in part because it lacks a coherent theory of development, instead merely following intellectual trends in academic development economics. Although it has always lent money for the construction and modernization of physical infrastructure—including power plants, roads, railways, sanitation systems, irrigation systems, and more—and continues to do so today, the organization has over time focused less and less on industrial development and more on improving outcomes in public health, education, and bureaucratic administration, with the result that probably a majority of its activity today is more akin to consulting, giving out subsidies to government bureaucracies, or even outright charity.
>
> In recent years, climate change has also become a policy focus at the expense of development, with the World Bank claiming that 40% of its annual committed funds are for climate change prevention and mitigation. Although this is almost entirely creative recategorization of projects in order to appear ideologically fashionable, it continues the long-term trend of the World Bank’s institutional decay as it moves away from straightforwardly financing industrial development.
>
> ... The funds for such projects are always lent to national governments, which then designate “implementing agencies” that are typically government bureaucracies, whether at a national, regional, or local level, or state-owned enterprises. As a result, many of the World Bank’s projects amount to financial support for the government institutions of middle-income and low-income nations. Project goals are often loosely defined and the function of the funding is simply to support general government functions, both through supplying funds that the recipient states lack, but also through supplying technical expertise that their bureaucracies lack. A recent $500 million IBRD loan to Peru, for instance, summarizes the goals of the project as “support Government reforms to: (a) strengthen fiscal management, and (b) foster a more productive and greener economy.”
>
> This dynamic has perhaps resulted in the World Bank allocating more and more funds to the public health, education, finance, and administrative bureaucracies of governments too. In Indonesia, $600 million has been allocated to “enhance the delivery of services to accelerate the reduction of stunting.” It is unclear how much of these funds are used to pay for tangible nutritional supplements or immunizations, as opposed to advising Indonesian government institutions on how to acquire and distribute such supplies; neither activity is likely to directly spur economic growth or industrial development. A $600 million education project in Ethiopia to “improve equitable access to basic services and strengthen accountability systems at the decentralized level” lists success metrics including school enrollment and the number of financial audits undertaken by local governments. A $500 million project in Egypt appears to be just providing subsidized housing for poor families.
>
> In this regard, the World Bank appears to be functioning simply as a more diversified and bureaucratized version of the IMF, perhaps with more generous loan terms and less policy conditionality. Moreover, since the World Bank’s funding is less closely tied to fiscal crises and immediate financial demands on states, the funds it does provide are much more easily stolen or misspent, while contracts to provide services on World Bank projects are obtained at some unknown frequency through bribery. High-profile instances of fraud include large-scale theft in a project to repair the water network in Yerevan, Armenia in the early 2000s, and the suspension of funds in two Kenyan projects in 2009. Accounting firm Ernst and Young’s Kenyan subsidiary was recently debarred from providing future services to World Bank projects due its involvement in bribery relating to two recent projects in Somalia.
>
> **How the World Bank is Governed**
>
> ... McNamara’s advocacy of agricultural lending was founded in his belief that developing nations would benefit the most through exploiting their natural comparative advantages of low labor costs, initially through expanding productivity of their large agricultural sectors to compete better in global markets.
>
> In hindsight, this was the completely wrong strategy to drive industrialization and development. Technologically-enhanced overproduction of food in developed countries has driven global agricultural commodity prices to their lowest levels in history, with even relatively developed countries like Argentina failing to make agricultural exports a driver of industrialization. If anything, subsidizing smallholder farmers may have contributed to prolonging poverty and lack of industry. Just before his tenure ended in 1981, McNamara negotiated China’s entry into the World Bank, but the World Bank’s lending volumes to China were trivial relative to China’s large GDP, and the Bank’s relationship with China was one of giving policy advice. It seems that the World Bank played no significant role in China’s economic rise from poverty to global manufacturing superpower, the greatest development success of the last century.
>
> None of McNamara’s successors since 1981 have had the prominence or independent thinking of McNamara. In the absence of a high-level vision for global development, the Bank has become guided by wider intellectual trends in development economics, which shifted towards emphasizing the importance of education and other “human capital” factors such as health as prerequisites for development. Continuing under the aegis of poverty reduction introduced by McNamara, the Bank expanded its remit into lending for education and social safety nets, a role that it had previously shied away from. The Bank also became more responsive to the short-term demands of its shareholders, a factor amplified by the need to replenish the IDA’s funds every three years. Western non-profit organizations found a pathway to influence the Bank by lobbying national parliaments, and the growth of their influence meant that the Bank’s objectives became even more diffuse, incorporating environmentalist and social goals to an ever-increasing extent.
>
> **Development Has Become a Low Priority for the World Bank Out of Necessity**
>
> ... The World Bank’s failures in Africa illustrate why the Bank has slowly deprioritized industrial development over the decades. To successfully build a giant dam or solar farm, it is not enough just to lend the money needed for initial construction, but also necessary to become involved on-the-ground and, in effect, provide or negotiate out the state capacity that is lacking in the first place, from long-term subsidies and administration up to and including physical security.
>
> This is no longer just a financial question, but a political one, requiring not just bureaucratic decision-making but attentive long-term leadership from empowered individuals and live players. Much as China has found with its foreign investment in countries like Pakistan, exporting economic development requires risky and difficult political intervention to first achieve political reform of the factors preventing development in the first place. Although the Bank has the funds to finance such interventions, it has never been configured to provide them, or even seek out and bet on enterprising individuals who might make use of such funds.
>
> Apparently, the opportunities to spur development through conventional profitable bank lending were exhausted by the 1960s. The reforms Robert McNamara introduced during this period also failed to spur development, instead setting the precedent that the World Bank could invent new metrics like poverty reduction, public health access, or most recently climate change mitigation to justify its continued existence. The result is further divergence from industrial development and funds being spent as subsidies or aid. But ultimately, these are less failures of ideology than adaptations of necessity in the face of institutional incapacity to meet a stated mission. This means the World Bank’s profile of activities is unlikely to change in the near future, although it may claim it has pivoted to climate change in addition to existing fashionable goals like ending poverty. In reality, it will simply continue long-running institutional underperformance, acting as a subsidy for Third World governments, until a live player once again thoroughly reforms it." - [The World Bank is Not Driving Economic Growth, Bismark Analysis](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/p/the-world-bank-is-not-driving-economic)
