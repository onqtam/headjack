> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter-intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self-reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Beings are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we are all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)




goal-directedness, dynamic systems theory, attractors & basins of attraction
Not sure if anything (apart from an attractor definition) is usable from this, but worth re-reading. Or maybe the entire paper.

> "ATTEMPTS AT DEFINING GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS
>
> ... the world is full of systems, such as bacteria, cheetahs, people and corporations, which behave as if they are striving to achieve some as yet distant goal state.
>
> ... Perhaps the simplest operational definition of goal-directedness is **equifinality**. This is the notion that different initial states of a system all lead to the same final state... For example, the bacterium will end up at the food source and the hunting cheetah at the gazelle no matter which position they started out from within that goal state’s broad neighborhood... However, this is no longer true for the irreversible dynamics implied by thermodynamics. Here, initial differences tend to be erased by the inexorable increase of entropy. For example, a ball that rolls down into a bowl will come to rest in the lowest point at the bottom of the bowl, having dissipated its energy of motion through friction. It does not matter where in the bowl (initial state) the ball started its trajectory: the end point will always be the same equilibrium state of minimal potential energy. This type of equifinality is not what we would intuitively see as goal-directedness, though. This problem can be avoided by demanding that the final state would be a steady state “far-from-equilibrium”, i.e. a state that requires active intervention and a continuing flow of energy to reach and maintain. Indeed, life is a far-fromequilibrium condition, and organisms cannot survive without a constant source of energy to keep their metabolism going. This also captures our intuitive notion of agency as being active, i.e. mobilizing energy or resources in order to combat physical forces such as dissipation. The ball in the bowl, on the other hand, is merely passively obeying the external forces of gravity and friction. That is why von Bertalanffy restricted equifinality to open systems that exchange resources with their environment.
>
> ... The philosopher Nagel tried to define goal-directedness in a similar vein... he distinguished two requirements for goaldirectedness: **plasticity** and **persistence**. Plasticity is roughly equivalent to equifinality. The agent is “plastic” in the sense that it can adapt to a wide variety of initial conditions and still find a way to end up at the same goal. It is moreover “persistent” in the sense that if that movement is perturbed, so that the agent is made to deviate from its anticipated trajectory, it will establish a new trajectory pointing towards the same target, thus persisting in its movement towards the goal. Note that it can be argued that persistence is not an independent condition, but merely an aspect of equifinality: the deviation merely pushes the agent to a different initial state, from which it will now again hone in on the same end state. For a goal-directed trajectory, it does not really matter whether the initial state was the product of a perturbation or not... Nagel added a third, less well-defined criterion, of which different versions have been echoed by different authors. The idea is that agents make use of a repertoire of complementary actions, components or functions that work together in a coordinated manner in order to achieve the goal... A perhaps better term is what I will henceforth call **concerted action**: the activities of the different components of the system work together in a driven, coordinated manner, so as to efficiently mobilize the resources needed for the achievement of the goal state...
>
> GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS IN CYBERNETICS
>
> A final, and perhaps most elegant, way to operationally define goal-directedness is the one proposed by cybernetics. The cybernetic conception assumes equifinality and persistence, but proposes a precise mechanism through which these are realized: regulation through negative feedback... Cybernetics introduced the notion of circular causality to explain how a goal can causally affect an initial state without contradicting the fact that causes precede effects.
>
> Although apparently paradoxical, circular causality can be implemented simply by feeding the output (effect, result) of some system or process back to its input (cause, initial condition). This is also known as re-entry, and is the basis of what in mathematics and computer science is known as recursion. As I will illustrate further, circular organization, in the sense of the system producing (part of) its own input, makes that system to some degree autonomous, i.e. able to maintain its own dynamics without being at the mercy of external inputs that it does not control. This crucial feature of self-determination can also be seen as a form of bootstrapping: it is as if the system lifts itself up (movement towards the goal) by pulling (output action) on its own bootstraps (input component).
>
> Note that this circularity occurs in space, not in time: the output is redirected to affect the same component or variable of the system that was affected by the input, i.e. where the process started. But that feedback of course cannot arrive before the initial input—though it can be nearly simultaneous, allowing for a practically instantaneous regulation of the input.
>
> For the simplest form of cybernetic regulation, you merely need a feedback that is negative. That means that the effect of the re-entered output is opposite to the effect of the input that caused it. In practice, this means that if some perturbation (input) has made the system deviate from its goal-directed course, then the reaction of the system (resulting output fed back to become a new input) will counteract or compensate that deviation, thus putting the system back on track towards achieving the goal...
>
> A DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS INTERPRETATION OF GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS
>
> ... In the theory of dynamic systems, an attractor is defined as a region in state space that the system can enter, but cannot leave—and that contains no smaller such region. An attractor is surrounded by a basin of attraction. This consists of all the states whose trajectories converge to the attractor. That means that the dynamics of the system is such that if you calculate the trajectory starting from any initial state in the basin, then that trajectory will eventually reach the attractor and stay there. The attractor functions as the final destination of all trajectories that start in its basin. Under conditions that I will further specify, it can therefore be understood as the “goal” or “end” of the system... In practice, however, a real-life system, such as an organism, an ecosystem or an economy, is subjected to various unpredictable perturbations that make it deviate from its initial trajectory. These perturbations result from events that the system does not control, i.e. that are not part of its dynamics as defined by the function f. They typically originate in the system’s environment. Examples are encounters with other organisms, accidents or changes in the weather. Because of such external disturbances, the precise trajectory of a complex system, such as an organism, is in practice impossible to predict. Nevertheless, if we know the attractors and their basins, then the final destination becomes predictable again: as long as the perturbations do not push the system outside of its present basin, its dynamics will sooner or later lead it back to that basin’s attractor... The term “attractor” may be misleading, though. It is not the attractor that exerts some pulling force, attracting the system towards itself. It is the system, because of its own, intrinsic dynamics, that is consistently moving towards the attractor, and that will persist doing so even if pushed away from its initial trajectory by a perturbation (that does not leave the basin)... If we make the additional assumption that the attractor is not an equilibrium state of minimal potential energy, like the ball at the bottom of the bowl, then this attractor-directed movement requires the on-going mobilization of energy-providing resources. This is necessary to climb up any potential energy gradients and to compensate for energy lost through dissipation. Therefore, the system’s moves towards the attractor and against deviations can be interpreted as goal-directed actions. Such a system exhibits a basic form of agency: it actively resists forces pulling and pushing it, rather than passively being subjected to them, like the ball being pulled down by the force of gravity...
>
> CONCERTED ACTION
>
> ... But where did the primary goal of survival come from? This is another way of formulating the origin of life problem: how did an assemblage of physico-chemical processes that were not goal-directed give rise to an organization that was efficiently directed at the goal of self-maintenance? And how did such an organization develop the necessary plasticity and persistence to dependably achieve that goal in a highly variable environment bombarding it with a wide variety of perturbations?...
>
> ATTRACTORS AND BASINS
>
> ... Another common type of attractor is a limit cycle. Here the endpoint of the process is not a single state but a continuously repeating sequence of states... A classic example of this type of attractor can be found in the cyclical increases and decreases in the populations of predators and prey... But a limit cycle could also describe various metabolic cycles inside the organism in which certain molecules or structures are periodically broken down and then rebuilt. Such cycles must be kept going, and any deviation from them must be opposed so that the system converges back to its attractor. The goal here is not a state, but a periodic process...
>
> ... A perhaps unconventional attractor regime can be represented by an infinite line. (Note that the line itself is not strictly an attractor, but a component of an attractor basin that converges toward an attractor lying at infinity.) This can describe processes of on-going growth, where certain variables, such as population, size or experience increase without a priori limit... Such return to an ideal process rather than an ideal state may be called homeorhesis (“flowing the same”) instead of homeostasis...
>
> ... An important issue is that goal-directedness is characterized by sufficient plasticity, persistence and concerted action. All of these imply a large basin of attraction surrounding the attractor/goal. The larger the basin, the larger the number of initial states ending up in the attractor (equifinality, plasticity), the larger the deviations from its initial trajectory the system will be able to compensate (persistence, negative feedback), and the larger the number of variables that it will be able to control in a coordinated, goal-directed manner (dynamical coherence, concerted action). Now, imagine an attractor with a small surrounding basin that extends just a little outside the attractor. The smallest perturbation will be sufficient to push the system across the border of that basin, into the basin of a different attractor. That means that it cannot on its own return to its goal. Goal-directedness here is very weak, because the system is hardly able to resist any perturbation from its preferred configuration. Such a goal configuration is fragile or brittle. The opposite of brittleness is robustness, or more precisely resilience, i.e. the ability to bounce back to the goal configuration after undergoing a more or less intense perturbation. Thus, from the dynamical systems perspective, effective goal-directedness appears equivalent to the resilience of the goal configuration...
>
> Another question worth raising is how a dynamical system can model subordinate goals (e.g. feeding), which are in reality merely way-stations, stepping stones or means that lead to the overall goal or end (e.g. surviving). An attractor by definition is the ultimate outcome of a process. Any intermediate steps towards this end must therefore be situated in the basin, not in the attractor. Yet, they may still be attractors for a subsystem of the overall dynamic system, i.e. a partial system that lacks certain components or variables. For example, the goal of feeding can be modelled as an attractor if we consider “hunger” not as a variable, but as a fixed property with the value “high”. For hungry cheetahs, feeding is the dominant goal. However, if we turn “hunger” into a variable, the model would need to incorporate an additional dynamics which states that hunger decreases sharply after feeding, that the system in a state of low hunger is directed at “resting and digesting”, and that the latter activity slowly increases the value of the variable “hunger”, until we get back to a state where “feeding” is the dominant goal. Such an additional variable plays the role of a control parameter, which changes the dynamics in such a way that stable solutions (attractors) may shift, bifurcate, or disappear while the parameter value changes. An example of such an approach can be found in Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a cybernetics-inspired dynamical model of goal-directed behavior in organisms and people. Here, a goal (reference value to which a negative feedback control loop converges) at a subordinate level is set by the action (output) of a control loop directed at a goal of a higher level. The higher-level control loop takes into account additional perceived variables (such as hunger) to specify which goal (e.g. feeding or resting) the subordinate loop should target. This method of turning a goal state that is fixed at one level into a variable that is controlled at a higher level allows PCT to develop a complex, multilevel hierarchy of goals for describing behavior on both short-term and long-term time scales.
>
> THE ORIGIN OF GOAL-DIRECTED SYSTEMS
>
> ... Implicitly, though, evolutionary theory specifies the most fundamental goal of all: survival. For far-from-equilibrium systems, survival means first of all active self-maintenance: the continuous repair and reconstitution of components and structures that would otherwise be consumed by the inevitable production of entropy. This concerns in particular the dynamical structure that distinguishes the “self”, i.e. the system to be maintained, from its environment, i.e. the perturbations that affect the system’s functioning, but which the system does not control. It is this perspective that led Maturana and Varela to define living systems as autopoietic, i.e. self-producing. Autopoiesis is achieved through organizational closure: the processes inside the system are organized in a circular manner, so that their output becomes part of their input and dynamics, and the different components and processes reconstitute each other. Self-maintenance can be seen as the ultimate goal, value, or end of a living system. For such natural systems, “the purpose of the system is what it does”, to use a famous expression coined by the cybernetician Stafford Beer. The system’s goal is not imposed by some intelligent designer, like in artificial or “allopoietic” systems. Its goal is intrinsic or implicit to the way the system functions: to continue functioning in the same way. Thus, a living system exemplifies a structure with emergent purpose: its components and processes are merely simple causal mechanisms; yet together they form an autonomous “agent” or “self”, i.e. an organizationally (but not thermodynamically) closed whole that acts so as to ensure its continued functioning.

> ... the emergence of goal-directed organizations from simple causal processes is neither mysterious nor improbable, but rather the natural outcome of an evolution that homes in on self-maintaining configurations, while selecting the ones with the greatest ability to survive a wide range of perturbations.

> ... I then showed that goal-directedness is not only consistent with standard, “forward” causality, but that it complements such causal explanations by allowing us to predict the outcome of processes where complexity, stochasticity or external perturbations make step-by-step causal prediction impossible. For example, the assumption that a cheetah’s behavior is directed at the goal of feeding allows you to predict what will happen when the cheetah catches the gazelle it is chasing—no matter how complex and unpredictable the trajectory described by the running cheetah and gazelle.
>
> This feature of diverse and irregular trajectories predictably ending up in the same final state is known as equifinality. Related characteristics of goal-directedness have been formulated as plasticity (being able to reach the same goal under a variety of different circumstances), persistence (continuing to move towards the same goal in spite of perturbations) and negative feedback (neutralizing deviations from the goal by a compensating counteraction). A more complex characteristic is what I have called concerted action: the coordination of the activities of the different components of the system towards the goal.
>
> All of these features can be elegantly explained by means of a dynamical systems model of the goal-directed process. The dynamics of such a system commonly exhibits attractors: regions in the system’s state space to which all trajectories in the attractors’ basin converge, so that the attractor functions as the true “end” of the process. Perturbations are in this case automatically compensated by the dynamics, at least as long as they do not push the system outside of the basin. The attractor/goal does not need to be a fixed state (homeostasis), but can be a complex process that is circular (limit cycle) or ever advancing (homeorhesis).
>
> In order to differentiate a goal-directed system, such as a living organism, from a system that merely settles in a stable equilibrium, such as a ball ending up at the bottom of a bowl, I added the requirement that the attractor should correspond to a far-from-equilibrium configuration, i.e. one that requires input of energy in order to reach and maintain. That fits in with our general intuition of goal-directed agency as actively intervening in the world by mobilizing resources—rather than passively submitting to external forces.
>
> While such dynamical systems may provide a causal model of goal-directed behavior, this invites the question how systems could have originated that have the right configuration of causal processes to produce this kind of dynamics. To elucidate this, I briefly sketched the formal framework of Chemical Organization Theory, which starts from reactions (chemical and other) between resources as elementary causal processes. This framework shows how networks of such reactions tend to self-organize into attractors known as “organizations”, which are characterized by selfmaintenance and closure. Thus, organizations provide a simple and elegant model of the circular, self-producing dynamics that have been postulated in the theories of cybernetics, autopoiesis and autocatalytic cycles as the essence of autonomous agency, and thus of life. While this model requires a bit of abstract mathematics in order to demonstrate the otherwise counterintuitive notion that self-maintenance can emerge spontaneously, its elements, the reactions, represent concrete physical, chemical or biological processes.
>
> Yet, goal-directedness as I defined it, and life as we know it, require more than a self-maintaining configuration. That configuration should moreover be highly resilient, i.e. it should be able to recover from the wide variety of perturbations it is likely to encounter in a natural environment. That in turn requires that the corresponding attractor should be surrounded by a very extensive basin—a requirement equivalent to wide-ranging plasticity, persistence and concerted action..." - [The meaning and origin of goal-directedness: a dynamical systems perspective, by Francis Heylighen](https://cris.vub.be/ws/files/84393768/Goal_DirectednessBJLS_final.pdf)




metamodern sociology
maybe use this as an optional expandable section? or not...

> "And this is where metamodern sociology enters the picture. It begins from a similar move, one of further secularization. If postmodern sociology always posits that there are power structures controlling our behaviors and knowledge claims, metamodern sociology eschews even this belief. Rather, metamodern sociology begins from the proposition that power structures are only truly surface phenomena, shadows of a deeper and impersonal reality: the reality of complex emergences that crisscross one another. There are hence, ultimately, no power structures to “question” or even simply “remove”. Instead, there are processes that guide the emergence of the perspectives in the world, and this in turn guides behaviors and results.
>
> Because we cannot relate to society without taking a position based upon our perspective, the metamodern mind argues, we should own up to the perspective that we take, and the developmental direction implied by that view. We should then deliberately employ the sociological methods to shape society, its culture, institutions and economy, in this desired direction. This sense of direction is held, again, with sincere irony. We may know full well that our perspectives are limited and our visions partly imaginary, but we choose to take the risk, with informed naivety.
>
> Postmodernism can only ever be a critique of the existing modern society, affecting some patterns here and there. Metamodernism, as a movement and sentiment, seeks to suggest new paths for society altogether: a new overarching equilibrium. This has long been taboo in the social sciences. But it is time that the taboo is broken, and that creative minds use the sociological imagination to suggest concrete futures and make visible new potentials.
>
> In this sense, metamodern sociology marries the progressive impetus of modern sociology and its will to take modernity “as an object” that can be shaped and directed, to the multi-perspectival, deconstructive and “ironic” stance of postmodern sociology. This can, admittedly, be done in more or less fruitful manners. At worst, it is a shotgun wedding, where the worst of both worlds are combined – for instance, an undermining of scientic rigor in the name of relativism and unrealistic suggestions about a future utopia. At best, it is a nimble bifurcation between critique and progress, where new suggestions are carefully scrutinized and evolved. Or better yet, borrowing a term from quantum physics: metamodernism holds the modern idea of progress and the postmodern critique in superposition to one another – depending upon the participant perspective of the observer, each new inquiry can lead either to critique and resistance, or towards a path to deep progress.
>
> If modern sociology is about “reality”, the societal facts of the matter, and postmodern sociology is about “perspective”, the differing views of the facts of the matter, then metamodern sociology is about “potentials”, i.e. the larger realm of all possibilities contained within the multiplicity of mutually interacting perspectives. Metamodern sociology thus seeks to reorganize the generative conditions of how all of these perspectives emerge, evolve and interact.
>
> Modern sociology asks: What is society?
>
> Postmodern sociology asks: How is society viewed, by whom, and why?
>
> Metamodern sociology asks: How do these views of society emerge, and how can they be made to emerge in ways that are benecial from a multiplicity of weighted and compared views?
>
> The generative conditions of perspective in its necessary multiplicity. This is the ultimate object of study for a metamodern sociology. Metamodern sociology thus takes up the task of cataloging, understanding, comparing, and non-arbitrarily evaluating the many perspectives of society, self, and reality. The evaluation of perspectives is, of course, only something that can be done by having some over-arching meta-theory or larger conceptual space within which the perspectives can be placed in relation to one another. Hence, the metamodern divorce from the postmodern is completed: the postmodern mind would not have allowed for the formulation of an over-arching meta-theory, a narrative of narratives, a perspective of perspectives. And yet, this is what each metamodern sociologist must work on: a suggested map of meaning, one that can always evolve and be scrutinized by others – or “co-developed”.
>
> This map-making is, naturally, an enormous task that can never be concluded. But it is only through such a work that one can hope to suggest pathways for society which, for all future, will consist of many competing and contradicting perspectives. Deconstructing and critiquing perspectives of others, or even of oneself, cannot be enough. One must, sooner or later, reveal from which meta-theory one is working, and from there on say how and why the great multiplicity of perspectives can be evolved. This is a synthesis of modern and postmodern sociology; but as the metamodern mind also builds upon and attempts to transcend and include the postmodern perspective, it must always remain a proto-synthesis – i.e. not a synthesis held to describe the actual development of what Hegel called the world-soul, but a “good enough for now, safe enough to try” attempt to act in good faith. Hence, beyond its intellectual underpinnings, metamodern sociology is also an act of faith – of ironic piety – or even, if you will, of enlightened madness.

> Describing metamodern sociology...
>
> **Developmentalism of perspectives.** It is a tenet of metamodern sociology that perspectives are not arbitrarily ordered, but that they emerge in recognizable patterns. A poststructuralist critique of literature has never emerged in a tribal society with no writing; quantum theory has never emerged in a traditional, pre-modern, society. Even if strands of thought can be linked backwards in history (process philosophy back to Heraclitus and so forth), there are indeed specic ideas that build upon one another: multiplication builds upon addition. And these sequences are, in turn, always dependent upon social and material – ultimately, even biological – conditions, with which they interact. Postmodernism did not emerge before modernism, nor could it have. For this reason, metamodern sociology always looks for meaningful and explanatory developmental sequences, putting them into relation to one another on some kind of developmental scale. This developmentalism thus accepts at least some minimal form of stage theories; and these stage theories are not mere phases (childhood, maturity, old age) but indeed stages (addition, multiplication, power functions). Each stage must be, in clearly denable terms, either more complex than the former, or, at a minimum, be derived from the former and qualitatively distinct. For instance, one may study how people, such as police ofcers, think about an issue like “race and ethnicity”; some will reect upon these matters in simpler terms, “black people commit more crimes”, others in more nuanced and complex terms “some groups in society are underprivileged and are thus driven into crime more easily”, and some in yet more complex terms “through my work and perspective, I have a role in recreating the crime statistics that keep up the over-policing of some ethnic groups, which breeds exclusion and resentment in these groups”. In the minds of different observers with distinct perspectives, the same phenomenon appears differently, with different conclusions. These three suggested perspectives are not merely outcomes of different personalities, but they build upon one another: there is a developmental sequence – and if more police ofcers are supported to independently being able to think in accordance with the more complex perspective, this is likely to be more aligned with their dealings with the complexities of society and criminal justice. To eschew all developmental sequences of such perspectives is to atten the view, as it were, projecting a three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional surface. This is what the metamodern sociologist calls “developmental blindness”. Unfortunately, postmodern sociology is more or less developmentally blind, which explains a large part of its impotence to create workable pathways for culture and society to take.
>
> **Meta-theory and map-making**. It is another unfortunate limitation to contemporary sociology that students are not taught comprehensive maps of the theoretical landscape of sociological theories, so that choice of theory and perspective can be selected non-arbitrarily, with well-argued motivations. There is a severe lack of meta-theory. Rather, the choice of theory, and indeed, the entirety of academic careers, are based upon which theories happen to “speak to” the individual scholar, often being dened by earlier work on the particular topic of study. Sociologists become “interactionists”, “constructivist feminists”, “Marxists”, “middle-range theory institutionalists” and so forth, depending upon whim and chance, often unable to communicate meaningfully across these sub-disciplinary boundaries. This is an enormous waste of potential, as the meta-theoretical space is sub-optimized. To be fair, prominent sociologists like Jeffrey Alexander and Georg Ritzer have indeed presented meta-theoretical maps of the territory, but these have not taken a central place in the education of sociologists, and a researcher is generally not expected to give convincing reasons for his or her position within a larger meta-theoretical map. Neither do a few courses on the “philosophy of social science” grant students a comprehensive map, as these also simply enumerate a host of competing positions. Metamodern sociology is different: It begins and ends in meta-theory, always naming the underlying meta-theory, one’s own theoretical position within it, and always returning to the metatheoretical map once the theoretical and empirical dive is concluded, feeding something back to this fundamental “ground-level” of social science. A good place to start is Ken Wilber’s comprehensive work on “integral theory”, which includes several important meta-theoretical maps – but it is a telling sign that one must look to relatively esoteric writers beyond the discipline, like Wilber, to nd good material for such mappings. In short, the emergence of the many perspectives in sociology and its large body of theories is not arbitrary; it covers different aspects of injunctions into the nature of society. If there is any one thing that particularly prevents sociology as an academic discipline from becoming a proper “science”, it is this lack of meta-theoretical maps – all the perspectives and injunctions end up beings “smashed together” in a grand, confusing hotchpotch. By going to the source, to the map-making of the sociological territory, one can begin to restore order to this cosmos, and thus specify which truth claims are relevant as basic tenets of each form of injunction, ridding the landscape of redundant and contradictory theories. Metamodern sociology must thus work from a more highly abstracted and complex level, zooming in on different phenomena from different theoretical perspectives, all the time explicating why and how each zoom is made. Naturally, one’s meta-theoretical map – if you will, one’s underlying paradigm made explicit – will also shape one’s view of what society is and how it functions.

>
> To conclude, sociology and metamodernism both share a key concern: to take modern society “as an object” that can be described, interpreted, related to, and ultimately reshaped; both entities work to see through and go beyond the modern. Hence, the argument can be made, that metamodernism belongs at the heart of the future of the sociological discipline, i.e. a sociology true to its own promises must become metamodern in its perspective – and, conversely, that sociology belongs at the heart of metamodernism. When metamodernism attempts to assert itself as a new self-organizing principle of society, it must be able to “see” modernity as the substrate upon which it operates. This follows, as the reader may have noticed, the pattern of subject-object theory: that with which one was earlier identied and took for granted, one’s “subject”, becomes an “object of awareness” from the new and higher vantage point — higher, of course, according to one’s developmentally informed meta-theory." - [An Open Invitation to a Metamodern Sociology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/an-open-invitation-to-a-metamodern-sociology/)

> "Modernism, so conceived, is a bankrupt paradigm. Yes, we can be nuanced, and should be, recognizing that it also brought with it many emancipations, cured many ills and diseases, added many comforts and luxuries, and generally allowed people the opportunity to explore self-actualization as they never could before. For these reasons, metamodernism embraces and takes up the genuine insights of modernism into its worldview. But it also takes up its postmodern critique, which is valid and urgently necessary. For, as we speak, the very suburban wastelands I’ve just described are still spreading, growing, “developing” across the globe. Indeed, is not the meta-crisis itself the cancer created by this modernist metastasis?" - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/post/reflections-on-the-dawn-of-everything#:~:text=Modernism%2C%20so%20conceived,this%20modernist%20metastasis%3F)

> "So, we have four major schools of normative ethics: rule-based ethics, contractualism, virtue-based ethics, and consequentialism. Each, I would claim, come with its own validity claim:
>
> • **The validity claim of rule-based ethics** is that an action has to be in accordance with universal principles that can be justied a priori and deduced from self-evident premises derived from the action itself in order to be considered ethically valid—ultimately regardless of context.
>
> • **Contractualism’s validity claim** is that the rules regulating our conduct have to be based on a priori principles that must be mutually agreed upon by reference to the relationship between actors in order to be considered ethically valid.
>
> • **The validity claim of virtue-based ethics** is that an action cannot merely be judged as good or bad in itself, but what matters is the moral character of the agent which can only be judged a posteriori, and then only by reference to a description of the action or property itself viewed through the lens of its particular social context.
>
> • **Consequentialism’s validity claim** is that actions can only be considered ethically valid if the outcome of these a posteriori happen to have preferable consequences overall, and then only by reference to some collective end based on the relationship between all actors.
>
> ... It should be obvious by now that “taking sides” regarding which school of ethics to follow is a foolish endeavor. The same can be said of any impulse to entirely discard one or more of the schools. Obviously, all four schools have important perspectives to offer. But the question still remains how exactly to use them and how to manage and reconcile their differences. Just knowing about the four schools and how they t into the fours quadrants does not in itself sufce to resolve ethical paradoxes. In the following I will attempt to show not just how the four schools complement each other, but also how they depend on each other and ultimately collapse into each other.
>
> ... The reason that we are still wrestling with the same ethical dilemmas century after century is that we have been accustomed to assuming that the world of ethics is at; that a linear logic permeates the world of normative ethics, so when you reach the end of a world corner (the place where you hit philosophical bedrock), you simply fall of the edge. But the world of ethics is not at. It is round, spherical. Or, rather, toroidal (donut-ical). The moment you hit the edge of one world corner, you end up at the beginning of another. We all need to stop being ethical atearthers. We must all become ethical donuts." - [A Four-Dimensional Fractal Approach to Ethics, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/a-four-dimensional-fractal-approach-to-ethics/)

^^ reread this piece if/when you get serious about ethics in the future


> "Nations, religions, cults, gangs, subcultures, fraternal societies, internet communities, political parties, social movements – these are all really different, but they also have some deep similarities. They’re all groups of people. They all combine comradery within the group with a tendency to dislike other groups of the same type. They all tend to have a stated purpose, like electing a candidate or worshipping a deity, but also serve a very important role as impromptu social clubs whose members mostly interact with one another instead of outsiders. They all develop an internal culture such that members of the groups often like the same foods, wear the same clothing, play the same sports, and have the same philosophical beliefs as other members of the group – even when there are only tenuous links or no links at all to the stated purpose. They all tend to develop sort of legendary histories, where they celebrate and exaggerate the deeds of the groups’ founders and past champions. And they all tend to inspire something like patriotism, where people are proud of their group membership and express that pride through conspicuous use of group symbols, group songs, et cetera. For better or worse, the standard way to refer to this category of thing is “tribe”.

> ... If you take only one thing from this essay, it’s that communities are best understood not logically but historically. If you want to understand the Shia, don’t reflect upon the true meaning of Ali being the rightful caliph, understand that a dispute involving Ali initiated ethnogenesis, the resulting culture picked up a bunch of features and became useful to various people, and now here we are. If you want to understand the rationalist community, don’t ask exactly how near you have to think the singularity has to be before you qualify for membership, focus on the fact that some stuff Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote led to certain people identifying themselves as “rationalists” and for various reasons I enjoy dinner parties with those people about 10000% more interesting than dinner parties with randomly selected individuals. nostalgebraist actually summed this up really well: “Maybe the real rationalism was the friends we made along the way.” Maybe that’s the real Shia Islam too, and the real Democratic Party, and so on.

> ... 5. Religious Literalism: One comment complaint I heard during the height of the Atheist-Theist Online Wars was that atheists were a lot like fundamentalists. Both wanted to interpret the religious texts in the most literal possible way. Being on the atheist side of these wars, I always wanted to know: well, why wouldn’t you? Given that the New Testament clearly says you have to give all your money to the poor, and the Old Testament doesn’t say anything about mixing meat and milk, maybe religious Christians should start giving everything to the poor and religious Jews should stop worrying so much about which dishes to use when? But I think this is the same mistake as treating the Sunni as an organization dedicated to promoting an Abu Bakr caliphate. The holy book is the rallying flag for a religion, but the religion is not itself about the holy book. The rallying flag created a walled-off space where people could undergo the development process and create an independent culture. That independent culture may diverge significantly from the holy book. I think that very neurotypical people naturally think in terms of tribes, and the idea that they have to retool their perfectly functional tribe to conform to the exact written text of its holy book or constitution or stated political ideology or something seems silly to them. I think that less neurotypical people – a group including many atheists – think less naturally in terms of tribes and so tend to take claims like “Christianity is about following the Bible” at face value. But Christianity is about being part of the Christian tribe, and although that tribe started around the Bible, maintains its coherence because of the Bible, and is of course naturally influenced by it, if it happens to contradict the Bible in some cases that’s not necessarily surprising or catastrophic. This is also why I’m not really a fan of debates over whether Islam is really “a religion of peace” or “a religion of violence”, especially if those debates involve mining the Quran for passages that support one’s preferred viewpoint. It’s not just because the Quran is a mess of contradictions with enough interpretive degrees of freedom to prove anything at all. It’s not even because Islam is a host of separate cultures as different from one another as Unitarianism is from the Knights Templar. It’s because the Quran just created the space in which the Islamic culture could evolve, but had only limited impact on that evolution...
>
> ... My title for this post is also my preferred summary: the ideology is not the movement. Or, more jargonishly – the rallying flag is not the tribe. People are just trying to find a tribe for themselves and keep it intact. This often involves defending an ideology they might not be tempted to defend for any other reason. This doesn’t make them bad, and it may not even necessarily mean their tribe deserves to go extinct. I’m reluctant to say for sure whether I think it’s okay to maintain a tribe based on a faulty ideology, but I think it’s at least important to understand that these people are in a crappy situation with no good choices, and they deserve some pity. Some vital aspects of modern society – freedom of speech, freedom of criticism, access to multiple viewpoints, the existence of entryist tribes with explicit goals of invading and destroying competing tribes as problematic, and the overwhelming pressure to dissolve into the Generic Identity Of Modern Secular Consumerism – make maintaining tribal identities really hard these days. I think some of the most interesting sociological questions revolve around whether there are any ways around the practical and moral difficulties with tribalism, what social phenomena are explicable as the struggle of tribes to maintain themselves in the face of pressure, and whether tribalism continues to be a worthwhile or even a possible project at all." - [The Ideology Is Not The Movement | Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/)
