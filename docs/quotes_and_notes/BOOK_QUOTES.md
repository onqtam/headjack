We mean something analogous to the idea of social engineering, a concept that came about at the end of the 19th century that refers to the intentional design of specific social arrangements and ways of operating. The Reddit platform itself is not social technology, but its use of moderators is...
>
> It’s important to note that all except the simplest social technologies are designed. Though many of our crucial social technologies seem like natural parts of reality today, this was not always so. At some point they required intentional construction and adoption. Many social technologies we take for granted, including the very idea of having such critical systems as currency, law, and government, were born from concerted human agency. It is for this reason that we call it social technology, rather than social “norms”, or take a broader anthropological or philosophical approach. Much like material technology, social technology is designed, adopted, and scaled. It is proceduralized and documentable.

The giver and recipient collaborate to publicly assert that the recipient is worthy of prestige, and that the giver has the authority to grant it. Honors are thus acts of an alliance to mutually boost prestige...

> "If one looks closely at any society, one will observe that its rulers—and their prestige—subsidize all other sources of prestige. Thus, when the landscape of power shifts, the landscape of prestige shifts accordingly. It is then critical that rulers are incentivized to allocate prestige well—that is, in accordance with the actual distribution of excellence. If they aren’t, as in the case of Stalin, the resulting distortions in the allocation of prestige produce distortions in their society’s understanding of what is good and what is true. Lysenkoism was an epistemic and moral disaster. This kind of corruption can ultimately have catastrophic effects on the society’s health, because the ability to ascertain the truth is fundamental to the functionality of a society’s people and its institutions." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)
^^ not sure how to use this quote... maybe parts of it?

> "Among the many different kinds of honors, we can pick out two especially common ones: those meant to incentivize a particular achievement with a financial reward, which I call prizes, and those meant to afford prestige on the basis of past achievement, which I call awards. Prizes aim to get some specific thing done, whereas awards aim to affect the distribution of prestige, incentivizing achievement in a more indirect way. With a prize, money is fundamental. With an award, it is incidental. The Millennium Prizes are a prime example of the former, the Academy Awards of the latter.
>
> This distinction is often muddled, leading honors to be less effective than they could be. I have to clarify what I mean by each term, because in practice they aren’t used in a reliable way. There are awards that are called prizes and prizes that are called awards. Despite its name, the Nobel Prize is a hybrid case that is more of an award. Though it comes with a financial reward, it is primarily about affording prestige, and this is what those who try to win it are after. The money is nice, but the glory is better.
>
> It’s for this reason that I think that awards are more effective than prizes in incentivizing the production of knowledge. Glory is a greater motivator than money...
>
> A prize also provides less return on its creator’s investment of social capital than an award. Once the goal is achieved and the prize won, there is no longer a reason for it to exist. It is self-abolishing. An award, on the other hand, can continue to be given out year after year, compounding the investment of prestige." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "The more closely social status corresponds to activity that’s ultimately beneficial for society, the more such activity is incentivized, much more strongly than by even a large financial reward.

> "Status is one of the irreplaceable currencies whose necessary transfer is often denounced in this way. Michael Sauder et al. define status as the relative respect and patterns of deference accorded to people, groups and organizations by wider society... People cannot engage in any common projects without some commonly agreed-upon deference to people, groups or organizations, nor can they engage in common projects without someone or something holding, and yes, spending status. Status is a coordination mechanism, and this makes it valuable.
>
> If we come together to do great things, much status is required, whether vested in an institution or an individual. That someone will be holding status in this sense, personally or as a representative of an organization, then, is an unavoidable consequence of people coming together to do things. Perhaps one can argue for a dispersed distribution of status as the best way for us to organize such efforts, but the fact is that deference by some towards others on technical and resource distribution questions is still the central guiding factor." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

The key problems here are the creation and identification of sufficient skill, together with ensuring the next founder has inherited a position of sufficient power to remake the institution. Of course, even if the succession problem is handled once, it remains a problem for the next generation.
>
> If the succession problem remains unsolved, the only process of institutional reform available is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as “creative destruction”. That our society valorizes rather than bemoans such outcomes unfortunately demonstrates that we have become accustomed to failed succession and notable dysfunction.

> "In the West today, we operate under the influence of our own key philosophy, which we can call scientism: the tendency to rely on scientific claims to describe the functioning of society, even when there is no empirical reason to assume that they apply. We act as if we are already living in a scientifically-planned society, immune to collapse on a timescale that any of us have to worry about. This is very far from the truth. We are certainly living in socially-engineered societies, but they are not scientifically planned in any straightforward way. Our organs of economic management do not secretly know how the economy really works. Our systems of political regulation are operating on the fumes of their institutional inheritance from two or three generations ago—the last spurt of institutional growth in Western societies happened roughly during the 1970s." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "Our society is dominated by large bureaucracies. These bureaucracies break down the processing of physical goods and information into discrete tasks, such as how a factory worker puts doors on a car, or a stock trader buys futures contracts. These tasks are shorn of their context and executed in a systematized environment whose constraints are quite narrow: put the car door in, increase the portfolio value. Our society is thoroughly compartmentalized. This compartmentalization isn’t driven by the division of labor, but rather by the need to make use of misaligned talent without empowering it. By radically limiting employees’ scope of action, you make office politics more predictable. By fragmenting available knowledge, you can leverage information asymmetries to the intellectual or material advantage of the center. Some of this is necessary for scaling organizations beyond what socially connected networks can manage—but move too far towards compartmentalization, and it becomes impossible to accomplish the original mission of the organization." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

Some could be distinguished by their focus on economic concerns, others on scientific, martial, religious, or humanitarian ones. But all of them had a system of awarding, regulating, and seizing status and prestige and, in fact, that system is the engine that drives a society to concern itself with something or other beyond its mere survival... The assignment of status and prestige to one field or another will directly affect how much effort is put into it, and thus how much a society achieves in that field." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)




> "We are bad at allocating attention, both individually and collectively. For example, how much attention do you pay to your friends and family, or to the existential question of the meaning of your life? And how much attention are we paying as humanity to the great challenges and opportunities of our time, such as the climate crisis and space travel? Markets are not able to help us better allocate attention because prices do not, and cannot, exist for many of the issues that we should be paying attention to. Consider paying attention to finding your purpose in life: there is no supply and demand that will form a ‘purpose price’ for an individual; it’s ultimately up to you to allocate enough attention to this existential question." - [The World After Capital, by Albert Wenger](https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/readme#:~:text=We%20are%20bad,this%20existential%20question.)

If we all used bots to interact with Facebook and didn’t like how our newsfeed was prioritized, we could ask our friends to instruct their bots to send us status updates directly, so that we could form our own feeds.

The reason users don’t wield the same power on mobile is that native apps relegate end users to interacting with services using our eyes, ears, brain and fingers. We cannot use the computing capabilities of our smartphones, which are as powerful as supercomputers were until quite recently, in order to interact with the apps on our behalf. The apps control us, instead of us controlling the apps. Like a Web browser, a mobile user agent could do things such as block ads, keep copies of responses to services and let users participate in multiple services simultaneously.

Unfortunately, in the US there are three separate laws that make those steps illegal. The first is the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The second is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). And the third is the legal construction that by clicking ‘I accept’ on an End User License Agreement (EULA) or a set of Terms of Service (TOS), I am legally bound to respect whatever restrictions Facebook decides to impose.

> "It is a matter of power. If we compare the level of voter turn-out in different elections for different forms of political body, a clear pattern emerges. There is a direct link between power and turn-out: the more power is up for grabs, or, to put it another way, the more power is connected to the position or body to which people are being elected, the greater the level of voter interest. This means that the crisis of democracy has nothing to do with a loss of faith in active politicians per se, but is mainly to do with a growing concern about the increasing impotence of politicians. The silent protest of a growing number of couch potatoes is not directed towards politicians’ abuse of power, but towards their loss of power.
>
> This fact is, unfortunately, not particularly 'sexy’, and does not fit in with media dramaturgy; it does not provide any attention-grabbing headlines and it does not provide ammunition for a bout of populist mud slinging. And, above all, it does not serve the interests of the media. So, instead, we are supplied with a constant stream of propaganda telling us about the righteous contempt that the people feel for the corrupt political class, which only serves to weaken the position of politicians still further, which in turn leads to a new round of gauntlet running in the media. This process continues in a vicious circle, the inevitable culmination of which is the death of representative democracy, the complete impotence of politicians and a hyper-real media dictatorship. This process is strengthened by feedback. Through the use of opinion polls, whose questions are obviously phrased by the media to serve their own purposes, the population is told what it thinks and what it is ‘natural’ to think. Then the media go on to show how the adaptable politicians are adapting to this norm, or pretend to be adapting, and so the process goes on and on, ad infinitum. The investigations of the mass media are, on their most profound level, investigations into the mass media themselves. Statistics that purport to represent public opinion are actually the tools used by the media to manufacture opinion." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "Speed and the abolishment of distance hastened the materialization of information. The telegraph revolutionized the transport of information over long distances and, as a consequence, a great deal of contemporary attention was paid to transportation and speed, while other aspects - such as interpretation, context and comprehension - were neglected. A piece of quickly transported information came to be regarded as something valuable in itself, quite regardless of what it meant or could be used for. But the fact that technology solves one problem does not mean that all related problems disappear or become less pressing. Working out how to transport information over great distances does not mean that people know how to interpret and understand the information in a relevant context. What happens is simply that some things are left in the shade when the sun rises over a new paradigm. For every problem solved by a technology, at least one new problem usually appears." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

What we lack today is not information, but overview and context.

> "How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the elite in power within a democracy - the best-organized lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates - can effectively achieve the same result. Against any given collection of Tacts’, another instantly appears; against the report of any given piece of alarming scientific research, another more reassuring one appears. And so on. And afterwards everything gets back to business as usual. It looks like a vital democracy, but it is merely a spectacle for the masses. This torrent of information is thus no unforeseen phenomenon and certainly in no way a fortuitous lottery jackpot for the citizens and consumers, but is actually a conscious strategy for maintaining social control. Powerful interest groups send out murky clouds of distracting information in order to maintain the secrecy of certain essential knowledge. The overload of information and the lack of context are intimately linked, two aspects of the same subject." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

The frequent showers of contradictory information have one single coherent message: don’t trust your experiences and perceptions - listen to The Latest instead. But The Latest is quickly succeeded by The Very Latest, and it is practically impossible to imagine any information, any combination of new facts, that could affect the status quo to any noticeable degree: partly for practical reasons, because facts are so fickle and their rate of replacement so high, partly purely theoretically, because there is an absence of any context that is valid for the whole of the social collective, from which the implications of these facts could be determined.

> The public, consisting of engaged citizens with a common interest in and responsibility for the general good - the classic precondition of democracy - never materialized in reality. Instead, the ever more vocal mass of the population and the ever more ambitious middle class, which had so terrified the privileged elite of the nineteenth century, are being transformed under the relentlessly increasing pressure of information into a divided and ruler-friendly multitude of antagonistic special-interest groups. This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, in other words, all this torrent of new information that is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, ‘precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure’.

> "If the eighteenth century’s newspapers and pamphlets had reflected a genuine, revolutionary opinion that was critical of power, then the press during the nineteenth century was considerably more of an instrument of power with which the public was consciously manipulated and a general opinion manufactured. This means that it is still correct to regard the press, and information, as a weapon. But also that it is important to keep an eye on whose finger is on the trigger, and which interests this person represents. The capitalist elite, like every other, sought to maintain the status quo. The primary task of its propaganda was to protect social, economic and political privileges in an age when privileges were no longer the fashion and when increasing welfare and improved education were leading to demands for more rapid increases in equality. Those in power sought, quite consciously, with the help of the PR experts who were beginning to sharpen their tools by the beginning of the twentieth century, to turn the increase in welfare and the improvements in education to their own advantage and persuade the ambitious middle class of the advantages of entering into a tacit but nonetheless effective pact. The trick was to present the alternative - political change - as something extremely unpleasant. The message was that the newspaper-reading middle class risked losing its hard-won gilt-edged life if the existing order was disturbed: that chaos and mob rule threatened if the winds of change were set free. The trick worked. It was possible, it turned out, to manufacture opinion. PR methods were built on science - what else? The PR experts regarded themselves as scientists." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The electronic mass media offered even better opportunities to set people’s tongues in motion. The printed word still requires a certain level of education in order to be understood, whereas radio, for instance, requires nothing but the flick of a switch and adequate hearing. This gave propagandists of all descriptions an opportunity to get inside people’s homes in a way that was historically unique. Film, and eventually television, offered the opportunity to communicate directly through images. For someone looking at images, either moving or frozen, their perspective and the act of seeing are determined by the originator of the image. This opens what the critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin calls ‘the optics of the unconscious’: a shortcut for the camera to bypass the intellectual censorship that comes into effect when we have to adopt a position towards a message on the abstract level of words; a direct channel into the individual’s private dream factory where unexpressed desires and fears roam about. Anyone who can manage to stay awake will experience a stimulating massage of his or her irrational inner self.
>
> The theatrical presentation of democracy demanded steady direction if it was not to go off the rails: this was the main creed and business idea of the developing PR industry. Historical factors - welfare and education - made it necessary for the ruling and - naturally - responsible elite to develop a well-stocked toolbox of power so as to be prepared for all eventualities. General opinion was in constant need of tending and pruning - no undesirable weeds could be permitted to grow too tall. The masses could easily start to think a mass of foolish ideas. The medicine for this was information, but it must be administered by experts within the mass media and the world of social psychology. With the help of precise science it would be possible, in theory at least, to fine-tune the intellectual and emotional life of the masses.

> "This activity is carried out to an extent unimagined by the general population. One tangible example, taken from the sociologist Stuart Ewen, is how American opinion was programmed fundamentally and in good time for a potential military offensive against Iraq in the early 1990s. One congressional inquiry that gained a great deal of media attention involved a 15-year-old girl from Kuwait, a hospital volunteer who testified that she had witnessed with her own eyes how, after the invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi troops had entered the hospital in Kuwait City, dragged premature babies out of their incubators and left them to die on cold corridor floors. This grim act of barbarism outraged the USA. No one paid any heed to the fact that the girl in question remained anonymous, for the stated reason that her own safety was at risk. Only in retrospect, when the war was long over, did it emerge that the girl was actually Nayirah al-Sabah, daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the USA, and that she could not possibly have seen the things she testified to having seen. It also became apparent that her appearance before the inquiry had been arranged by one Gary Hymel, vice-MD of Hill & Knowlton, one of the largest PR companies in the world, which counted the Kuwaiti royal family among its wealthy clients. Nayirah’s testimony was part of a conscious and successful strategy and was one of a great number of manufactured media events, all designed to direct American fury at Baghdad." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Increased competition is not visible so much in the form of direct confrontations as it is in the division of every market into several smaller, ever more specialized sub-departments. Every player, both individuals and entire cultures, is forced to distil those qualities that are in demand by the particular niche of the market holding sway at that moment, to the detriment of general knowledge and overview. This leads to the development of an increasingly tightly connected, finely meshed network of mutual dependency.

The principle of transparency is that all the members of the network have access to all relevant information, and that at any time they wish they can make their own contribution to the internal debate. All cards are on the table, everyone can form their own opinion and make comments, everyone can participate in the decision-making process. If transparency is the dominant principle in informational society, this will entail a revolution in the labour market. When a traditional business is transformed into a transparent network, the employer can no longer treat employees according to feudal principles governing the exercise of power.

Each successful decision one way or another might lead to spectacular gains, while each unsuccessful decision about access or exclusion might have devastating consequences for the curators’, and therefore the network’s, reputation and credibility. It is reputation, or capital of trust, that is the network’s most important asset; with the help of reputation, attention is attracted to the networks, and there is a great shortage of attention, rather than money, on the net.

The curator will assume the state’s function as moral guardian and will punish all transgressions against netiquette by expelling the delinquent from attractive networks. Exclusion, restricted access to information and other forms of rescinded membership privileges are the netocracy’s methods for deterring and controlling dissidents. Severe limitations of virtual mobility will be the informational equivalent to internment. To protect their common interests and make the administration of the networks more effective, the curators will establish their powerful meta-networks for policy questions about net policing.

> "So much ideological capital has been invested in the idea of bourgeois democracy that every attempt to examine its propaganda critically and every discussion of possible faults in the democratic theory have been rejected with distaste and labelled as heresy by the immense forces guarding this myth. A cult has been constructed around democracy and its rituals: a cult with strikingly irrational elements, a mass movement whose cohesive idea is the notion that the magical power of the correct political procedure can solve, or at least ameliorate, all serious social problems. The forms of democracy themselves are believed to conjure up sound political content. The correct method of making decisions always results in wise decisions, according to this most potent of democracy’s dogmas. The self-appointed representatives of political goodness have persuaded themselves, and anyone who has cared to listen, that there is no difference between the correct method of making decisions and wise decisions, and whenever someone has the bad manners to point out that the Nazis, to take one striking example, came to power as a result of democracy and parliamentary elections, the response is always a series of diffuse explanations about the German population’s ‘democratic immaturity’, and the existence of that specific situation at that particular time. There is seldom or never a recognition that democracy itself is no guarantee for good and wise decision making.
>
> Every exception is turned around so that it confirms the general rule: as soon as the democratic maturity of the population has reached a certain acceptable level, democracy will automatically produce wise decisions like a well-oiled political machine. This faith in the process of democratic maturity of the population is as unshakeabie as it is unfounded. It is a matter of religious faith rather than empirical knowledge. According to the axiom, voters cannot vote wrongly, and if the people should nonetheless do so - like the Austrian people did when a populist rightwing party was elevated to government in the dying weeks of the twentieth century, a result which the rest of the European Union strongly opposed - then it is simply a matter of pronouncing loudly that a mistake has been made and bringing about a correction through suitable actions.
>
> This is all about the bourgeoisie’s parading democracy as if it in itself were something holy, yet being unable to accept democracy when it conflicts with the bourgeoisie’s own interests. There is a considerable amount of hypocrisy in the ceremonial rhetoric of democracy. What is at best a problematic and fragile compromise between conflicting political forces, and at worst a method of legitimizing the decisions that the elite wants to force through, is elevated as something good, eternal and beyond all doubt - something in accordance with the laws of nature. Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The real traditional family is something entirely different: an economic union and socialization project that links various generations together. The nuclear family - which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another late-twentieth-century phenomenon, nuclear weapons - ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of late-capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital (once again in the same boat), that people develop into ‘independent individuals’ rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realization, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.
>
> The nuclear family arose because it was the smallest, most individualized social entity that was feasible once the necessary requirements of reproduction had been taken into consideration. But as far as the state, and capital, are concerned, it does not need to be stable at all. A single parent is more dependent upon subsidies than a couple, and is therefore more submissive and more easily controlled. A marked increase in the number of single-occupancy homes also means, naturally, that consumption increases dramatically. The ideal would be for everyone to live alone in their own home, with their own car, so that optimal demand for houses, cars, sofas, cookers, etc., could be achieved. The path of the isolated, independent individual towards self-realization always passes through increased consumption." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Similarly, if we ask ourselves what politics really is, the answer is that politics is merely a continuation of religion by other means. And it definitely not only applies to Bolshevism or to other more or less doctrinal and airy-fairy movements with distinct features of sectarianism.

This is what people do and devote their lives to. We are, as Haidt writes, no saints, but sometimes we are really good team players. “Religion is loyalty to the world”, as the forefather of syntheism Alfred North Whitehead puts it." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "We all constantly act like believers in our everyday lives... We are all laymen in all conceivable subject areas that lie outside our own professional fields. We have first-hand knowledge of extremely little of everything that lies at the core of our existence and our societies. Accordingly, we choose our authorities on more or less arbitrary grounds, and we then choose to believe in what they claim without being able to investigate the matter to any extent at all. Dennett uses the formula e=mc2 as an example. Do we believe in it? Many of us have heard about it, and many believe they know it to be accepted by a number of experts within physics, which makes it appear truthful and plausible. But few of us can actually explain in any detail why, because few of us can be said to understand the formula in any reasonable sense of the word “understand”. So how can we believe in something we do not understand?
>
> What we do, according to Dennett, is believe that anything asserted about the formula e=mc2 is actually true. But in truth we do not know. And for this reason, it is impossible to attain anything even resembling consensus on, for example, the issue of the climate crisis. What opinion the layman has about it depends largely on what authorities he chooses to believe in, which in turn is governed by his political positions on issues that pertain to economic growth and government regulation, among other things. We believe in what agrees with what we already believe in. We are religious...
>
> The new, rational human being, freed from superstition and systematic self-delusion by the sciences that are making heroic progress, is a completely unrealistic utopia without any foundation in what research actually tells us about how people really function. We are religious, whether we understand it or not. We believe, and believe that we know much more than we actually do know. And actually it really does not matter at all what content is proclaimed from pulpits or in scripture. The person who enters into a discussion about the apparent self-contradictions or absurdities in a religious doctrine is barking up the wrong tree. Some believe in God X, endowed with certain attributes and preferences, while others believe in something else, which is either called God or something else. What is important and interesting is whether, and in that case how, religion actually works. Trying to understand religion’s tenacity and fervour by studying various ideas of God is, writes Jonathan Haidt, like trying to understand the attraction of football games to their audience by studying how the ball moves on the pitch.
>
> Religion has developed through cultural evolution, just like all other social-collective phenomena. Today we can reject a number of features of the content of many religions – it would be strange if it were not so – but we can hardly deny that they have served certain purposes under certain historically determined sets of conditions; and nor can we reasonably deny that they have in fact served these purposes with considerable success; otherwise religions would have perished without leaving many traces. But they did not. Along with psychologists such as Haidt and anthropologists such as Scott Atran and Joe Henrich we argue that the main reason is that this cultural innovation increased the coherence within groups and made them cooperate better internally compared to other groups. This did not necessarily mean that the other groups were outcompeted, but rather that they allowed themselves to be absorbed by the more effective religions.
>
> The crucial point of having a god is that the god is said to reward loyalty and cooperation, while punishing selfishness and mendacity. An all-seeing god is particularly effective in such a context, since people cheat less when they feel that they are being watched. Common sacrifices and collective rites increase coherence, which creates the trust within the group that enables intimate and trusting cooperation outside the circle of family members. According to Haidt with support from Charles Darwin and the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, the main function of religion is that it produces groups whose coherence makes them function like organisms. The biologist David Sloan Wilson writes in his book Darwin’s Cathedral that religions primarily exist in order for it to be possible for people to accomplish together what they cannot accomplish on their own.
>
> This productive coherence exercises a powerful allure for reasons that we need not address further. We humans are social creatures who experience well-being by doing things together with others, and its contrast – alienation and isolation – is not something on which one can build dynamic and prosperous societies. This in turn means, as Haidt points out, that in the sense of being modern people, enlightened and rational, we can choose to reject organised religion, but even if we do so, we cannot emancipate ourselves just like that from the basic religious psychology that we are concerned with here. However, we can, as stated, always manipulate the terminology and imagine that religion is something other than religion, because we have decided to call it something else, if this makes us feel modern and clear-thinking.
>
> Thus we have actually answered our opening question. God does exist. At least and without a doubt in an ontological sense. We have ourselves created the idea, just as we have created the ideas of democracy and art and a host of others. Religion lives, even among those who believe they have left it. Everything is religion and everyone is a believer. Anyone claiming the opposite, is truly, literally speaking, blinded by their faith. The really interesting question which thereby opens up is what to do with God and religion in the Internet age, when all the basic assumptions of our lives and existence are changing. How can God and religion become relevant, credible and engaging concepts for us and for future generations? That is the question which Syntheism seeks to answer." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The term religion stems from Medieval French where it signified the strong and heartfelt sense of community that prevails within a collective, a group of people who make up a congregation through establishing this loyalty to each other. This French term in turn originates from the Latin re-ligare: to reconnect with somebody or something, to connect again with those who, for some reason or other, have lost contact with each other but who ought to, and/or want to, belong together. So if we follow this term back to its source, we find that in its original sense religion ought to be seen as a social practice, organised with the purpose of creating strong and enduring ties between people, an affinity that in some cases, but far from always, also includes affinity between people and a set of gods, a theism.
>
> According to the Austrian monk David Steindl-Rast, religious practice starts with doctrine, which is followed by ethics and finally consummated in ritual – all with the purpose of creating a social emergence, to unite people around an entity that they experience as greater than themselves individually, and greater than the sum of the group of individuals. This is definitely something worth bearing in mind: the original point of religion was to create affinity and loyalty within a dynamic collective. In this context, God is no more than the arbitrarily chosen name for the sense of belonging that people seek. Nowhere is this usage of God as a productive object of projection clearer than in the person who has failed in life in his or her own mind and is bravely struggling for self-restitution. When Bill Wilson founds Alcoholics Anonymous in the United States in the 1930s for example, it was with the unshakeable conviction that religion – in whichever form it appears, as long as it preaches a sense of belonging that is greater and mightier than the small, cramped prison, which is how the addict experiences his/her own subjectivity – is the best possible springboard out of alcohol addiction. Religion is that within us which is greater than ourselves and for precisely this reason it is closer to our hearts than our fragile little egos." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

And if we do not find any such patterns, we don’t hesitate to quite simply invent them. With a utopia on the horizon, we give our lives a direction and a context. God is another name for utopia, and utopia is another name for God.
>
> The productive and fruitful response to atheism is not to indifferently accept the death of God, but to instead realise that it was a mistake to place God in the past as the ageless progenitor of us and the cosmos. We have already killed the God of the past by producing and accumulating large quantities of knowledge with which this divinity is not compatible. God as a functional utopia is instead the name of what we dream of creating; God is Syntheos, the created rather than the creating God. God is not (any longer) dead, since (we have now realised that) God has never been born: God belongs to us because God belongs to the future, and we already live in the future. The French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux expresses the syntheist passion in the words: “God is too important a concept to be left in the hands of the religious.”" - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

The Internet is thereby transformed from a technological into a theological phenomenon. The Internet is the God of the new age, and furthermore extremely appropriate for an age characterised by an unlimited faith in the possibilities of creativity. Thus, the Internet is a god that even those who regard themselves as atheists can devote themselves to. Syntheologically, we express this state of affairs as that the Internet is a manifestation of Syntheos, the new god that we humans are creating rather than the old god which, according to our ancestors, is said to have created us once upon a time in a distant past." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "If there is anything we can say with certainty, it is that alienation in the new network society will increase dramatically. A growing alienation is the price we pay for every increase in the technological and social complexity that we are experiencing now and for years to come. With the Internet’s breakthrough, it is literally exploding. And there is only one functional weapon against alienation, namely its opposite: religion. Traditional religion’s mistake was to place the name of its longing for another world, God, in the past (theism, belief in a preordained God), when the logically correct and only reasonable manoeuvre of course is to place the object of all human longing, God, in the future (syntheism, the belief in a God that man himself creates).
>
> The atheism that denies longing – between theism and syntheism – has played out its role as the necessary antipole between thesis and synthesis. For in its lack of content, and as pure negation, atheism is completely meaningless as the goal of the dialectical process. This acute lack of essence explains why atheists have never succeeded in building any cathedrals or anything at all except vapid paper monuments to their own excellence. It is like a philosophical temperance movement: you meet and are sober together, totally oblivious of the ecstatic party that is going on somewhere else entirely. Classical atheism can only say what it is not, but not what it de facto is. This purely negative and in essence substance-less doctrine is quite simply a worthless weapon against alienation. It consoles no one and explains nothing." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Only through a new syntheistic meta-narrative, constructed on the utopian conviction that humanity’s only possible salvation is through its creation of Syntheos, can the ecological apocalypse be avoided. It is not possible to preserve human life on the planet with any amount of politics. For politics is subservient to the capitalist death drive – there is no chance of becoming a leading politician without first becoming dependent on the statist-corporativistic power structure – which does its utmost to grind on relentlessly with its ruthless plundering of resources until the planet is uninhabitable and lifeless.

The Western welfare state, which is based on precisely such institutionalised wishful thinking about strong and continuous growth, is looking more and more like a cynical pyramid scheme.

> "If history is viewed as a Hegelian dialectics, we see a clear pattern: monotheism is the thesis, individualism is the antithesis and syntheism is the synthesis. That syntheism is the synthesis in this dialectical process is a consequence of the fact that theism and atheism can never meet; they are fundamentally and definitionally incompatible. Syntheism should absolutely not be understood as a compromise between theism and atheism – in Hegelian dialectics, a synthesis is something considerably more sophisticated than just a banal coalescence of thesis and antithesis – rather, it is a necessary continuation of theism’s and atheism’s combined dichotomy, the only possible way out of the paralysing deadlock that arises when theism and atheism are pitted against each other. As the logical synthesis of this pair of opposites (theism versus atheism), syntheism offers a possibility for the atheist to go further and uncompromisingly deepen atheism...
>
> Only through perfecting the individualist paradigm can mankind grasp its terrible consequences, and then, and only then, the door to the syntheist possibility swings open... Atheism robs the human being of her access to the holy and the divine by first sharing theism’s conviction that the holy and the divine must be synonymous with the transcendental, and then murdering the transcendental and thus reducing the human being to a cold and indifferent immanence, which is axiomatic for atheism. What syntheism does is that it picks up mankind in precisely the immanence where atheism has abandoned him and makes him apprehend the immanent as the truly holy and divine without any nostalgic longing for transcendentalism at all.

> "German philosopher Jürgen Habermas launches intersubjectivity as the highest truth that humans can aspire to after Kant has shifted objective reality to where it is hopelessly out of reach. According to Habermas, the absence of this objectivity can only be confronted and militated against by an extensive plurality of subjective voices. Habermas imagines that intersubjectivity is negotiated between actors on an equal footing in the public sphere, which is both laborious and time-consuming, but which in the end nonetheless yields a satisfactory result, due to lots of subjective positions confronting and interacting with each other. To take one example, the credibility of science is based on the conviction that intersubjective truth can be fished out through the process referred to as peer review.

> "If religion happens to be the answer, which it apparently has been in every type of society that we know of throughout all of human history up until today – what then is the question? What is it that makes the religious memeplex in particular so attractive and successful in the cultural evolutionary process?
>
> To start with, we cannot help but note that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to eagerly welcome religious memes and become a believer brain. Being part of the religious community is thus something that in one way or another feels satisfying for the individual member of the congregation, while the religious collective gains competitive advantages in relation to other groups because of their special form of cohesion and mutual understanding which creates trust, impetus and efficiency to an extent that is hard to top. Moreover, at least in the transition from the nomadic existence of hunters and gatherers to a settled agricultural one, religious memes are blessed with dedicated propagandists and watchdogs, who regard it as their mission in life to spread these memes in particular further, and to protect them from dangerous competitors in the struggle for survival.
>
> So what is it then that religion has to offer and that makes up for the small and big sacrifices that have always been connected with the practice of religion?...
>
> But the crass and simple answer to the question of what value religion – or what we call religion today – had and still has to offer its practitioners, is survival. Man is a flock animal and can only cope with the hard struggle for survival to the extent that he can create well-functioning groups. A lone individual is easy prey on the savannah. In order to achieve a well-functioning group, at least two things are required: effective communication, and mutual trust which functions best when in it based on common values. And it is precisely that you share the values and feelings of the collective which the devoted practice of religion signals to the world around you. You show that you can be trusted, that your loyalties are the right ones, and that you are a worthy member of the community. Therefore, there are also invariably costs involved in the practice of religion: through paying what it costs to demonstrate your commitment and loyalty to the continued existence of the group you signal that you are prepared to set aside self-interest. A religion, argues the anthropologist William Irons, is basically a control system where the loyalty and devotion of the members of the congregation is monitored by examining the zeal with which they carry out the mandated and preferably also costly rituals.
>
> In this way, you lay the foundation for the necessary trust within the group, and also lay the foundation for the body of regulations that has the task of governing the actions of its individual members, which in turn creates order and security within the system. Accordingly, the selfish deviant is provided with strong incentives to align herself with the group and subordinate herself to its values and set of beliefs. Or at least act as if subservience were the obvious choice. The alternative would be ostracisation or some other powerful sanction. And considering that our hunting and gathering forefathers in principle were constantly at war with other groups of species kinsfolk, who constituted their determined and dangerous competitors in the daily struggle for crucial resources, the cohesion of the collective has always been of the greatest importance. With time Man develops such an intense dependence on the chemicals serotonin and oxytocin, which are released in a torrential stream right at the point when feelings of belonging to the collective are felt, that this dependence in itself appears to be an equally strong foundation for Man’s special status as language or consciousness are.
>
> Warfare necessitates collaboration, in both people and ants, as the science journalist Nicholas Wade observes in his perceptive book The Faith Instinct. For both these species, it is necessary to be able to reliably identify group membership. The ants handle this exclusively with the aid of chemical signals and therefore, in contrast to humans, have no need for religious symbolism. In this context and from this point of view, the fear of the wrath of all-seeing divinities is a good thing: it increases the precision of the signalling system. People believe that selfish behaviour is punished and therefore submit to the given rules. The stronger this fear, the stronger the fabric that binds the society together will be. And the stronger this fabric, the more powerfully the chemical-hormonal reward system that the human being partly shares with the ant will be strengthened. This explains why soldiers who return from the most brutal conflicts often long to be back on the battlefield so intensely that they find it completely impossible to adapt to the peaceful environment at home. They quite simply lack the intense fellowship in the trenches and the chemical-hormonal rewards this sense of belonging is associated with – an experience whose strength only war and religion have succeeded in matching throughout history. With this fact in mind, it is not particularly easy for pacifist atheists to find satisfaction in life.

> Islam originally means precisely submission and every faithful Muslim submits to a strictly circumscribed way of life filled with more or less arduous duties in the form of daily prayers, fasts, pilgrimages, etc. The believer thus becomes a small but significant cog in an infinitely much greater machinery. In key respects, religion is precisely this: a liberation from the petty perspective of one’s own ego and the limited possibilities for asserting oneself in the world, which leads to a merging into a collective organism with everything that this means in terms of the feelings of expansion and ecstasy associated with coordinated behaviour, that is, participation in a socio-cultural emergence process. Singing, dancing, speaking in tongues: through various types of liturgical rites, religion binds the collective together emotionally and creates at least one convincing illusion of access to the transcendental. Personal antipathies and conflicts are lessened or disappear in the rhythmically synchronised intoxication of the community." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "Everything is religion, but everything is also politics. And politics is religion, and religion is to a high degree politics. Without utopias there are no visions, and without visions there is no collective and organised hope of a better life in a society that has undergone desirable changes. In a society without utopias, cynical isolationism reigns supreme in the public arena. For this reason, such a society is the most dangerous society of all. Each and every person at the most cares about herself and her loved ones, but displays a programmatic disinterest in how everyone else fares. This lack of social cohesion sooner or later leads to societal collapse within all key areas. The opposite of utopia is, as we know, dystopia. The approaching ecological apocalypse has emerged as our time’s great and dominant dystopia. The fateful question that will be decisive for the 21st century is how the approaching ecological apocalypse is to be prevented or at least tackled in order to ameliorate or postpone it if possible.
>
> We thus live in an age that lacks a credible utopia, but that at the same time is coloured by a doomsday narrative that is every bit as powerful as it is threatening in the political discourse. Environmental issues are constantly on the agenda, as is the collective guilty conscience because these issues are constantly being down-prioritised by politicians who instead give priority to short-term measures on hip-pocket issues, measures that might perhaps yield the odd job opportunity but that also damage or preclude the necessary improvements in the environment. The growing plurarchy in a society where everyone talks at cross purposes, and increasingly vociferously focuses on pseudo-issues, evokes a paralysing state of hypercynicism (see The Netocrats). At the same time it is at precisely chaotic points in history of this type that new metaphysical systems are established – with Pauline Christianity in the crumbling Roman Empire and Kantian individualism in conjunction with the French Revolution as two very clear examples – and there is no reason to believe that our age should be any different in this respect.
>
> The hypercynical state is namely due to the fact that the prevailing ideological paradigm is no longer in step with its surrounding material reality. Rather, the lack of utopianism and the abundance of dystopianism is the final proof of the prevailing paradigm having reached the end of the road and lost all remaining remnants of relevance." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is hardly a coincidence that these two movements are arising in the same places in the world – namely in Northern Europe and along the coasts of North American – since it is in these places that the expansion of the Internet is most powerful, psychedelic experimentation most extensive, and thus the insight into the planet’s vulnerability is being disseminated most rapidly and is gaining first a foothold. These two movements are, quite simply, two sides of the same metaphysical coin, and it is syntheism that is the coin itself." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The key issue when we are talking about a free and open Internet is of course how much transparency a society should and can handle. It is then important to understand that the problem with transparency is never the transparency itself – to confess, to lay bare one’s heart of hearts for one’s fellow sisters and brothers in the community, is also a holy act within syntheism – but how it affects the network pyramid in question, that is, who lays himself bare for whom and thereby risks, at least in the short-term, a possible loss of power first? Does the current transparentisation strengthen the top, middle or bottom of the prevailing power structure in the society? Is the power structure levelled out in the direction of the syntheist utopia’s radical equality, or is the prevailing power structure reinforced in such a way that social inequality is preserved?
>
> We seek the answers to these questions for example in the French philosopher Michael Foucault’s pragmatist ethics: If the transparentisation begins from the top down – that is, if it is the rulers who have all of their secrets exposed first – it can be implemented painlessly throughout the entire power structure from the top and all the way down. On the other hand, if the transparentisation begins from the bottom up, the consequence will no doubt be a capitalist police state, and thereby – apart from all the other misery that such a development would entail – the ecological apocalypse would soon be unavoidable. It is the citizens who must first know everything about the activities of the nation state and the major corporations rather than the statist-corporatist establishment being allowed to bug and register the citizens’ opinions and preferences.
>
> Therefore, according to syntheism the battle of WikiLeaks and other whistle-blower organisations to disclose cover-ups of the activities of people in power is a sacred project, while conversely the attempts of the nation states and the major corporations to bug and register the views of citizens represent a flagrant violation of universal, human rights. Transparentisation in an increasingly transparent society must quite simply spread from the top down by being switched on from the bottom up. The order must be the following: first the person in power bares himself, then the citizen bares herself. And it is precisely here that the antagonism between the new syntheist netocracy and the old statist-corporatist power structure becomes most apparent. The netocracy regards the Internet as a relationalist phenomenon: to be a netocrat is to identify with the network itself, to act as the Internet’s agent. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, regard the Internet as a correlationist object, alien to and hostile towards the individualist subject and therefore a troubling object that must be tamed and controlled, by force if necessary." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Accordingly, the fight for the free and open Internet is the answer to what must be done; it is the engine that drives the new utopia rather than the brake that hinders the old dystopia. What we are talking about here is far more than just parallel phenomena in the market for the shaping public opinion: syntheism is de facto the name of the digital integrity movement’s underlying metaphysics. This explains why the fight for the free and open Internet is the central political struggle in the 21st century. All other important political conflicts that play out during, and contribute to giving colour to, informationalism’s growth, are completely dependent on how this conflict unfolds. It concerns far more than the growing netocracy’s striving to ignore the ruling bourgeoisie, which has controlled the world since the paradigm of the printing press gained broad acceptance. Beyond the fight for the free and open Internet, the approaching ecological apocalypse is rearing its ugly head: a potential catastrophe that capitalism is responsible for and at the same time evidently lacks the ability to prevent." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is difficult to think of a clearer illustration of how the democratic system de facto has collapsed under late capitalism and has now definitively morphed into a chaotic plurarchy. If an intelligence agency can grab the power from elected representatives, the word democracy loses all meaning. This is no longer about a democracy but about a massive, paranoid bureaucracy that does not need to take into account at all any form of democratic or even judicial influence over how certain State agencies operate. Late capitalism’s obsession with security, which is constantly mistaken for safety, could hardly have been exposed any more clearly.

This applies not least to the country that, more than any other, has acted as the emblem of liberal democracy, the USA. This once proud defender of universal freedom – in pace with an increasing number of hysterical narratives of fabricated external threats having been put forward – has been reduced to a lobby-controlled plurarchy in the hands of religious extremists and intelligence bureaucrats that operate in secret, backed up by interests that represent an enormous and thus depleting drain on resources (such as the NSA). It has gone so far that it is no longer the dream of individual freedom that is the engine in the American identity, but instead the collective paranoia.

Therefore new laws are constantly being produced, new crime classifications, new pathologies, new defects, new failures to rectify, new problems to investigate, which one can later expand on even further, rather than rectify them. Postmodern society offers no catharsis and lacks a narrative of how the capitalist tragedy is to be brought to an end. Capitalism quite simply lacks an exit strategy. Liberal democracy’s dilemma is not primarily that it is based on obsolete individualism – liberalism is individualism’s political ideology par excellence – but rather that it is based on the myth of the invisible hand’s mystical self-regulation. But such a hand does not exist, an unregulated market always moves towards sundry variants of corrupt monopolies or oligopolies as their terminuses. The invisible hand cannot do anything itself to stop this; that can only be done by visible hands. Pragmatism defeats liberalism every day of the week in actual politics.

Such a question of course assumes that we are intimately acquainted with some kind of god who does not exist anyway nor has ever existed, and beforehand at that. The correctly posed syntheological question is instead which god might come to exist, and the answer to this question is always synonymous with the core of the vision that is driving the paradigm in question. The syntheological response runs as follows: Tell me your utopia, and I will tell you what god you are seeking and following.

When given drugs that increase serotonin levels, rats smack their lips less to good food and shake their heads less to bitter food. This is also what we would expect given the evolutionary origin of serotonin: serotonin is the satiation, things-are-okay-now, satisfaction chemical, designed to turn off valence responses.

To solve the temporal credit assignment problem, brains must reinforce behaviors based on changes in predicted future rewards, not actual rewards. This is why animals get addicted to dopamine-releasing behaviors despite it not being pleasurable, and this is why dopamine responses quickly shift their activations to the moments when animals predict upcoming reward and away from rewards themselves." - [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050269-a-brief-history-of-intelligence)

In the transition to vertebrates, however, this good-things-are-nearby signal was elaborated to not only trigger a state of wanting but also to communicate a precisely computed temporal difference learning signal. Indeed, it makes sense that dopamine was the neuromodulator that evolution reshaped into a temporal difference learning signal, as the signal for nearby rewards it was the closest thing to a measure of predicted future reward. And so, dopamine was transformed from a good-things-are-nearby signal to a there-is-a-35 percent-chance-of-something-awesome-happening-in-exactly-ten-seconds signal. Repurposed from a fuzzy average of recently detected food to an ever fluctuating, precisely measured, and meticulously computed predicted-future-reward signal." - [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050269-a-brief-history-of-intelligence)

Even though you might not want to use Instagram, the same way gamblers don’t want to gamble or drug addicts don’t want to use anymore, the behavior is subconsciously reinforced, making it harder and harder to stop. Gambling and social feeds work by hacking into our five-hundred-million-year-old preference for surprise, producing a maladaptive edge case that evolution has not had time to account for. Curiosity and reinforcement learning coevolved because curiosity is a requirement for reinforcement learning to work. With the newfound ability to recognize patterns, remember places, and flexibly change behavior based on past rewards and punishments, the first vertebrates were presented with a new opportunity: for the first time, learning became, in and of itself, an extremely valuable activity. The more patterns a vertebrate recognized and the more places she remembered, the better she would survive. And the more new things she tried, the more likely she was to learn the correct contingencies between her actions and their corresponding outcomes. And so it was 500 million years ago in the tiny brain of our fish-like ancestors when curiosity first emerged." - [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050269-a-brief-history-of-intelligence)

In this same way, the power of language is not its products (better teaching, coordinating, and common myths) but the process of ideas being transferred, accumulated, and modified across generations. Just as genes persist by hopping from parent cell to offspring cell, ideas persist by hopping from brain to brain, from generation to generation. And as with genes, this hopping is not uniform but operates under its own quasi-evolutionary rules—there is a continual selecting of good ideas and pruning of bad ideas. Ideas that helped humans survive persisted, while those that did not perished." - [A Brief History of Intelligence: Evolution, AI, and the Five Breakthroughs That Made Our Brains](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62050269-a-brief-history-of-intelligence)

The bedrock of this hive brain is our language.

The fact that science could dependably produce reliable knowledge—in the form of theories or models that accurately predict the lawful or probabilistic behavior of the world—told Popper that science uses some kind of formal method to solve problems, unlike guessing or relying on gut instinct. In other words, the scientific method is an algorithm, a specific set of rules that can be followed to find a solution to a certain type of problem...

You have a problem that you believe can be solved, you make an informed guess or conjecture, then you see if your theory can be refuted—proved false—by testing its predictions (along with exposing it to criticism).

This little statement may not sound paradigm shifting, but it has some pretty far-reaching implications. A functional equivalence between the mechanisms driving evolution, learning, and science suggests that adaptation and scientific knowledge are actually the same thing. Biological adaptation represents knowledge of the environment, and the knowledge we acquire through learning and science reflects adaptation to the environment. If you think about it, there really is no meaningful distinction between adaptive information and scientific knowledge—both allow life to predict an uncertain world, control matter, constrain chaos, and construct order from disorder. The very same property that is responsible for life leaving the planet in spaceships is what permits an organism to climb uphill.

Adaptive complexity must continually expand the size of its repertoire of cognitive states to deal with the growing list of thermodynamic challenges it faces (those problems that threaten its far-from-equilibrium existence). By growing more intelligent, the biosphere, an interconnected, interdependent, integrated computational network, dissipates the solar-induced gradient more efficiently, producing thermal entropy at the fastest rate allowed by the laws of physics.

Agency only requires that a system have a world model—an internally embedded statistical mapping that represents the biologically relevant regularities in the environment. But the mere presence of a world model doesn’t mean that the contents of the model are being experienced by an observer. Subjective experience is always witnessed by a “self,” which forms the seat of a first-person perspective. So, it seems that progress in solving the hard problem of consciousness can be made by identifying the mechanism that brings about an observer with a point of view. What, then, is the source of the self?

> According to the cognitive philosopher Douglas Hofstadter, for a point of view to emerge, the agent’s world model must model itself. We call this example of self-reference self-modeling, and for reasons that will soon be explained, it is an ability that would seem to require a brain. If Hofstadter’s model of minds as models with self-models is correct—which he described in qualitative detail in his 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop—we finally have a relatively precise answer for when consciousness comes into the picture as a result of cosmic evolution. Mind, in the full sense of the word, emerges with brain. Self-modeling as the source of self might sound too obvious, but sometimes the answers to problems that appear difficult are staring us in the face.

The popular saying “What would Jesus do?” reveals that Christians who ask this question have modeled their deity and look to that model for advice, support, and existential insight. The same goes for every other religion, and when we realize this, we see why there can be practical benefits to modeling abstract entities that have useful characteristics or properties. This general process has been called “thinking through other minds” by the same researchers who have applied the Bayesian brain hypothesis/free-energy principle to high-level hierarchical systems beyond brains, like ecosystems and societies.

Now ask yourself, how accurate is your model of you?" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Hofstadter believes that the self, the I, the conscious observer, has true causal power on the world. He also gives us a vague but powerful insight into how this observer capable of causation comes into existence. By his account, the self emerges from self-reference “via a kind of vortex whereby patterns in a brain mirror the brain’s mirroring of the world, and eventually mirror themselves, whereupon the vortex of ‘I’ becomes a real, causal entity.”" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Details aside, the brain generates conscious experience when coordinated global activity emerges from the local electrical interactions of billions of neurons—the synchronous firing of those neurons integrates information from multiple processing streams into a single field of experience. It is not that synchronous firing of any kind produces conscious states, as we also see long-range synchronies with epilepsy. So, it is more careful to say that coordinated global firing at a particular synchrony (thought to be ~40 Hz) is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. This global activity is made possible by a phenomenon we are now quite familiar with, thanks to cybernetics: feedback. Feedback loops running from the thalamus to the cortex—so-called thalamo-cortical loops—integrate information and bind features into a cohesive perceptual landscape.
>
> When does consciousness disappear? When the feedback loops disappear, because it is these loops that entrain the activity of the component parts, bringing about the global integration of information. Whenever there is feedback, there is some form of self-reference at play, and in brains, it can be a signature of self-modeling. Without feedback, the brain still functions as a physiological organ controlling autonomic functions, but consciousness fades into nonexistence. We know the mental model is still encoded in the neuronal architecture of the brain, but what disappears is the observer, the self, which comes from the self-reference we get from real-time self-modeling. When the strange loop is disrupted—the multilevel feedback loop that mirrors itself—consciousness fades. So, the mind should no longer be thought of as a nonphysical entity moving things around; it is a multilevel cybernetic controller with causal power over itself and its environment." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Global neuronal workspace theory proposes a computational model for how separate processing streams are integrated into a unified conscious perception through emergent synchronous activity that produces a “global workspace.” If the global workspace is the mental workspace that we call the conscious mind, how exactly is that workspace created?
>
> We can answer that question by recognizing that the workspace corresponds to a neural attractor, and loops are obviously involved in the formation and maintenance of any attractor. It is specifically fronto-parietal loops that create the global workspace—or loops between functionally connected regions in the frontal lobes and the parietal lobes. When the activity of neurons in these areas become coordinated past a certain critical threshold, waves of global order propagate through the network, synchronous brain-wide firing occurs, and a global attractor of persistent electrical activity emerges from a phase transition that Dehaene calls an “ignition event.”
>
> This phase transition in the brain broadcasts the information in the global workspace to other neural modules that typically process information separately, leading to what Daniel Dennett calls “fame in the brain.” Now the information in the conscious representation is available for all kinds of additional processing not possible without the global workspace. Specifically, information in the workspace becomes the focus of selective attention, and its contents can be manipulated by working memory, or it can be used to make high-level decisions that the brain has no stored solution for. Planning and imagination are also made possible by the global workspace, which momentarily subsumes those independently working systems into the neural attractor, allowing minds to do things that can’t be done without consciousness, like running mental simulations of possible futures in order to select the one that is most desirable. Why should we think the global workspace has something to do with self-modeling? Because, again, we see feedback loops, and when the loops disappear, so does the mental workspace. Conscious processing of globally available information is disrupted and higher-level cognition dissipates.
>
> So, the neuroscience suggests that Hofstadter is right. It is the causal loops running across levels that create consciousness, what neuroscientist Anil Seth characterizes as a “controlled hallucination,” which is a step up from “illusion,” as Dennett described it in his landmark 1991 book Consciousness Explained." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "In this way, the continuation of cosmic evolution toward higher complexity and greater knowledge crucially depends on intelligent agents that can and will exercise free will. It is the power to simulate counterfactuals, or “what if” scenarios, that will illuminate the causal path that is consistent with the continued persistence of life in the cosmos. By using our conscious mind to imagine the future implied by an open-ended evolutionary process, we can see that intelligence-aided recursive self-organization will continually add new levels to the growing hierarchy of life and mind, making metasystems of increasing computational complexity, causal power, and self-referential richness. That gives us a duty to fulfill as sentient citizens of the cosmos.
>
> In the model of reality proposed by poetic meta-naturalism, there is room for destiny and free will. Because the future is not determined in the strict sense imagined by Laplace, there is no paradox. As individuals, we are truly free to choose our future path, but because it is in our nature to try and survive, our actions are not random; they are directed toward a goal, a goal that we all share as living agents. This shared goal—evading equilibrium—harmonizes our collective activity, and because human civilization learns from its mistakes, progress becomes inevitable.
>
> Since cosmic evolution inexorably generates increasingly robust and powerful multilevel cybernetic control systems, the emergence and outward expansion of intelligence in the cosmos was predestined, but in a completely natural sense of the word, as Christian de Duve, Freeman Dyson, Harold Morowitz, Ray Kurzweil, Christof Koch, and other renaissance men of science have argued. The freedom is at the level of the agent who exercises conscious causal control, not the aggregate behavior of humanity, which settles into increasingly stable and integrated attractors as knowledge accumulates in cultural memory." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "If we are to take the idea of multiple realizability (substrate independence) seriously, then minds can be realized on different mediums and on different scales, as long as the relevant causal and computational mechanisms are duplicated in brain-like hardware. If this is true, we must entertain the idea that an information-processing system like the internet, which in this definition includes the humans it connects, can possess conscious states similar to those generated by a biological nervous system. As long as information is being integrated by feedback loops that generate models of the world and the self—in this case, the “self” being the system that is the global brain—mind will presumably emerge." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Cosmic teleology is a worldview that recognizes the goal-directed nature of our universe, a dynamical system that is becoming increasingly complex and sentient as time moves forward and natural processes play out. The cosmic teleology presented in this book is an entirely natural teleology—specifically an evolutionary-computational teleology that is fully compatible with the laws of physics—and a scientifically rigorous theory, as it can be described in quantitative terms and makes testable predictions.
>
> Because in the past the word “teleology” has sometimes been associated with a religious belief in a supernatural or mystical force that guides evolution toward progress, the label will undoubtedly bother some skeptics and atheists who have an aversion to religion. But this should not deter us from using the most appropriate and recognizable terminology. It is worth reiterating that the cosmic self-organization process being described here is entirely mechanistic—a sort of “blind groping” toward an increasingly complex state, driven by the universe’s proclivity to process information and accumulate knowledge in the architecture of adaptive complexity. It is not guided by any external force or metaphysical entity; functional organization is internally generated from the physical laws and the evolutionary dynamics that emerge from the constraints those laws impose on matter in motion." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "A modern cosmic teleology—a computational or Darwinian teleology—eliminates all “explanatory gaps” in the evolutionary story, shattering the creationist’s claim of “irreducible complexity,” and in turn putting the nail in the coffin for any “intelligent design” theories that invoke the supernatural to explain life’s origin. But reducing the teleological development of the cosmos to a series of natural mechanisms does not explain away the mystery of why we find ourselves in a self-organizing world that becomes increasingly self-aware and computationally powerful through a series of inevitable emergences. We no longer have “irreducible complexity” in the creationist’s sense, but we have irreducible emergent phenomena like life and consciousness, which can’t be explained away reductively—that is, in terms of atoms following fixed trajectories—without losing something critical in the explanation." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

If we care about the futures of our children, and their children, such a task is a moral obligation. If we want to see a universe that isn’t cold and lifeless, but increasingly sentient and creative, then it is also a spiritual obligation.
>
> Many assume that when you get down to the nuts and bolts of nature, a spiritual worldview is simply incompatible with a scientific one. While that is the common assumption, it couldn’t be more wrong. Spirituality simply refers to a sense of connection to something larger than oneself, and it has nothing to do with the supernatural. To quote Carl Sagan again, “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.”9 Einstein not only shared this view but also believed that the only path to true spiritual enlightenment was the trail we travel along when we pursue scientific discovery. “The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.”10" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it – in a decade, a century, or a millennium – we will all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise?"
John Archibald Wheeler, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 480 (1986)

> "All progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal, cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations. This simple relationship between the cosmic and the human is a hint of a central role of people in the cosmic scheme of things." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

> "There is no inconsistency in having multiple explanations of the same phenomenon, at different levels of emergence. Regarding microphysical explanations as more fundamental than emergent ones is arbitrary and fallacious." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

> "13 - Choices
>
> ... The truth is simpler: if your conception of justice conflicts with the demands of logic or rationality then it is unjust. If your conception of rationality conflicts with a mathematical theorem (or, in this case, with many theorems) then your conception of rationality is irrational. To stick stubbornly to logically impossible values not only guarantees failure in the narrow sense that one can never meet them, it also forces one to reject optimism (‘every evil is due to lack of knowledge’), and so deprives one of the means to make progress. Wishing for something that is logically impossible is a sign that there is something better to wish for...
>
> We need something better to wish for. Something that is not in - compatible with logic, reason or progress. We have already encountered it. It is the basic condition for a political system to be capable of making sustained progress: Popper’s criterion that the system facilitate the removal of bad policies and bad governments without violence. That entails abandoning ‘who should rule?’ as a criterion for judging political systems. The entire controversy about apportionment rules and all other issues in social-choice theory has traditionally been framed by all concerned in terms of ‘who should rule?’: what is the right number of seats for each state, or for each political party? What does the group – presumed entitled to rule over its subgroups and individuals – ‘want’, and what institutions will get it what it ‘wants’?
>
> So let us reconsider collective decision-making in terms of Popper’s criterion instead. Instead of wondering earnestly which of the self-evident yet mutually inconsistent criteria of fairness, representativeness and so on are the most self-evident, so that they can be entrenched, we judge such criteria, along with all other actual or proposed political institutions, according to how well they promote the removal of bad rulers and bad policies. To do this, they must embody traditions of peaceful, critical discussion – of rulers, policies and the political institutions themselves.
>
> In this view, any interpretation of the democratic process as merely a way of consulting the people to find out who should rule or what policies to implement misses the point of what is happening. An election does not play the same role in a rational society as consulting an oracle or a priest, or obeying orders from the king, did in earlier societies. The essence of democratic decision-making is not the choice made by the system at elections, but the ideas created between elections. And elections are merely one of the many institutions whose function is to allow such ideas to be created, tested, modified and rejected. The voters are not a fount of wisdom from which the right policies can be empirically ‘derived’. They are attempting, fallibly, to explain the world and thereby to improve it. They are, both individually and collectively, seeking the truth – or should be, if they are rational. And there is an objective truth of the matter. Problems are soluble. Society is not a zero-sum game: the civilization of the Enlightenment did not get where it is today by cleverly sharing out the wealth, votes or anything else that was in dispute when it began. It got here by creating ex nihilo. In particular, what voters are doing in elections is not synthesizing a decision of a superhuman being, ‘Society’. They are choosing which experiments are to be attempted next, and (principally) which are to be abandoned because there is no longer a good explanation for why they are best. The politicians, and their policies, are those experiments.
>
> When one uses no-go theorems such as Arrow’s to model real decision-making, one has to assume – quite unrealistically – that none of the decision-makers in the group is able to persuade the others to modify their preferences, or to create new preferences that are easier to agree on. The realistic case is that neither the preferences nor the options need be the same at the end of a decision-making process as they were at the beginning.
>
> Why don’t they just . . . fix social-choice theory by including creative processes such as explanation and persuasion in its mathematical model of decision-making? Because it is not known how to model a creative process. Such a model would be a creative process: an AI.
>
> The conditions of ‘fairness’ as conceived in the various social-choice problems are misconceptions analogous to empiricism: they are all about the input to the decision-making process – who participates, and how their opinions are integrated to form the ‘preference of the group’. A rational analysis must concentrate instead on how the rules and institutions contribute to the removal of bad policies and rulers, and to the creation of new options.
>
> Sometimes such an analysis does endorse one of the traditional requirements, at least in part. For instance, it is indeed important that no member of the group be privileged or deprived of representation. But this is not so that all members can contribute to the answer. It is because such discrimination entrenches in the system a preference among their potential criticisms. It does not make sense to include everyone’s favoured policies, or parts of them, in the new decision; what is necessary for progress is to exclude ideas that fail to survive criticism, and to prevent their entrenchment, and to promote the creation of new ideas.
>
> ... SKIPPING STUFF ABOUT COALITIONS AND PROPORTIONALITY ALTHOUGH IT IS GOOD ...
>
> ... A successful truth-seeking system works its way towards broad consensus or near-unanimity – the one state of public opinion that is not subject to decision-theoretic paradoxes and where ‘the will of the people’ makes sense. So convergence in the broad consensus over time is made possible by the fact that all concerned are gradually eliminating errors in their positions and converging on objective truths. Facilitating that process – by meeting Popper’s criterion as well as possible – is more important than which of two contending factions with near-equal support gets its way at a particular election.
>
> ... Apportionment systems, electoral systems and other institutions of human cooperation were for the most part designed, or evolved, to cope with day-to-day controversy, to cobble together ways of proceeding without violence despite intense disagreement about what would be best. And the best of them succeed as well as they do because they have, often unintentionally, implemented solutions with enormous reach. Consequently, coping with controversy in the present has become merely a means to an end. The purpose of deferring to the majority in democratic systems should be to approach unanimity in the future, by giving all concerned the incentive to abandon bad ideas and to conjecture better ones. Creatively changing the options is what allows people in real life to cooperate in ways that no-go theorems seem to say are impossible; and it is what allows individual minds to choose at all.
>
> The growth of the body of knowledge about which there is unanimous agreement does not entail a dying-down of controversy: on the contrary, human beings will never disagree any less than they do now, and that is a very good thing. If those institutions do, as they seem to, fulfil the hope that it is possible for changes to be for the better, on balance, then human life can improve without limit as we advance from misconception to ever better misconception.

That omits the most important element of decision-making, namely the creation of new options. Good policies are hard to vary, and therefore conflicting policies are discrete and cannot be arbitrarily mixed. Just as rational thinking does not consist of weighing the justifications of rival theories, but of using conjecture and criticism to seek the best explanation, so coalition governments are not a desirable objective of electoral systems. They should be judged by Popper’s criterion of how easy they make it to remove bad rulers and bad policies. That designates the plurality voting system as best in the case of advanced political cultures." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

>
> ... Although we do not know exactly how creativity works, we do know that it is itself an evolutionary process within individual brains. For it depends on conjecture (which is variation) and criticism (for the purpose of selecting ideas). So, somewhere inside brains, blind vari - ations and selections are adding up to creative thought at a higher level of emergence.
>
> ... But merely being present in a mind does not automatically get a meme expressed as behaviour: the meme has to compete for that privilege with other ideas – memes and non-memes, about all sorts of subjects – in the same mind. And merely being expressed as behaviour does not automatically get the meme copied into a recipient along with other memes: it has to compete for the recipients’ attention and acceptance with all sorts of behaviours by other people, and with the recipient’s own ideas.
>
> ... The successful meme variant is the one that changes the behaviour of its holders in such a way as to make itself best at displacing other memes from the population. This variant may well benefit its holders, or their culture, or the species as a whole. But if it harms them, or destroys them, it will spread anyway. Memes that harm society are a familiar phenomenon. You need only consider the harm done by adherents of political views, or religions, that you especially abhor. Societies have been destroyed because some of the memes that were best at spreading through the population were bad for a society.
>
> ... Most ideas within a brain are created by it for the very purpose of trying them out in imagination, criticizing them, and varying them until they meet the person’s preferences. In other words, meme replication itself involves evolution, within individual brains. In some cases there can be thousands of cycles of variation and selection before any of the variants is ever enacted. Then, even after a meme has been copied into a new holder, it has not yet completed its life cycle. It still has to survive a further selection process, namely the holder’s choice of whether to enact it or not. Some of the criteria that a mind uses to make such choices are themselves memes. Some are ideas that it has created for itself (by altering memes, or otherwise), and which will never exist in any other mind. Such ideas are potentially highly variable between different people, yet they can decisively affect whether any given meme does or does not survive via a given person. Since a person can enact and transmit a meme soon after receiving it, a meme generation can be much shorter than a human generation. And many cycles of variation and selection can take place inside the minds concerned even during one meme generation. Also, memes can be passed to people other than the holders’ biological descendants. Those factors make meme evolution enormously faster than gene evolution, which partly explains how memes can contain so much knowledge. Hence the frequently cited metaphor of the history of life on Earth, in which human civilization occupies only the final ‘second’ of the ‘day’ during which life has so far existed, is misleading. In reality, a substantial proportion of all evolution on our planet to date has occurred in human brains. And it has barely begun. The whole of biological evolution was but a preface to the main story of evolution, the evolution of memes.
>
> ... Present-day methods of education still have a lot in common with their static-society predecessors. Despite modern talk of encouraging critical thinking, it remains the case that teaching by rote and inculcating standard patterns of behaviour through psychological pressure are integral parts of education, even though they are now wholly or partly renounced in explicit theory. Moreover, in regard to academic knowledge, it is still taken for granted, in practice, that the main purpose of education is to transmit a standard curriculum faithfully. One consequence is that people are acquiring scientific knowledge in an anaemic and instrumental way. Without a critical, discriminating approach to what they are learning, most of them are not effectively replicating the memes of science and reason into their minds. And so we live in a society in which people can spend their days conscientiously using laser technology to count cells in blood samples, and their evenings sitting cross-legged and chanting to draw supernatural energy out of the Earth.
>
> ... The Enlightenment is the moment at which explanatory knowledge is beginning to assume its soon-to-be-normal role as the most important determinant of physical events. At least it could be: we had better remember that what we are attempting – the sustained creation of knowledge – has never worked before. Indeed, everything that we shall ever try to achieve from now on will never have worked before. We have, so far, been transformed from the victims (and enforcers) of an eternal status quo into the mainly passive recipients of the benefits of relatively rapid innovation in a bumpy transition period. We now have to accept, and rejoice in bringing about, our next transformation: to active agents of progress in the emerging rational society – and universe.

> Cultures consist of memes, and they evolve. In many ways memes are analogous to genes, but there are also profound differences in the way they evolve. The most important differences are that each meme has to include its own replication mechanism, and that a meme exists alternately in two different physical forms: a mental representation and a behaviour. Hence also a meme, unlike a gene, is separately selected, at each replication, for its ability to cause behaviour and for the ability of that behaviour to cause new recipients to adopt the meme. The holders of memes typically do not know why they are enacting them: we enact the rules of grammar, for instance, much more ac curately than we are able to state them. There are only two basic strategies of meme replication: to help prospective holders or to disable the holders’ critical faculties. The two types of meme – rational memes and antirational memes – inhibit each other’s replication and the ability of the culture as a whole to propagate itself. Western civilization is in an unstable transitional period between stable, static societies consisting of anti-rational memes and a stable dynamic society consisting of rational memes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, primitive societies are unimaginably unpleasant to live in. Either they are static, and survive only by extinguishing their members’ creativity and breaking their spirits, or they quickly lose their knowledge and disintegrate, and violence takes over. Existing accounts of memes fail to recognize the significance of the rational/anti-rational distinction and hence tend to be implicitly anti-meme. This is tantamount to mistaking Western civilization for a static society, and its citizens for the crushed, pessimistic victims of memes that the members of static societies are." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

Given the character of the forces of change, we may be stuck for decades in this ungainly posture. You who are young today may not live to see its resolution. Famous landmarks of the old regime, like the daily newspaper and the political party, have begun to disintegrate under the pressure of this slow-motion collision. Many features we prized about the old world are also threatened: for example, liberal democracy and economic stability. Some of them will emerge permanently distorted by the stress. Others will just disappear. Many attributes of the new dispensation, like a vastly larger sphere for public discussion, may also warp or break from the immoveable resistance of the established order." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The incumbent structure is hierarchy, and it represents established and accredited authority—government first and foremost, but also corporations, universities, the whole roster of institutions from the industrial age. Hierarchy has ruled the world since the human race attained meaningful numbers. The industrial mind just made it bigger, steeper, and more efficient. From the era of Rameses to that of Hosni Mubarak, it has exhibited predictable patterns of behavior: top-down, centralizing, painfully deliberate in action, process- obsessed, mesmerized by grand strategies and five-year plans, respectful of rank and order but contemptuous of the outsider, the amateur.
>
> Against this citadel of the status quo, the Fifth Wave has raised the network: that is, the public in revolt, those despised amateurs now connected to one another by means of digital devices. Nothing within the bounds of human nature could be less like a hierarchy. Where the latter is slow and plodding, networked action is lightning quick but unsteady in purpose. Where hierarchy has evolved a hard exoskeleton to keep every part in place, the network is loose and pliable—it can swell into millions or dissipate in an instant.
>
> Digital networks are egalitarian to the brink of dysfunction. Most would rather fail in an enterprise than acknowledge rank or leaders of any sort. Wael Ghonim’s passionate insistence on being an ordinary Egyptian rather than a political leader was an expression of digital culture. Networks succeed when held together by a single powerful point of reference—an issue, person, or event —which acts as center of gravity and organizing principle for action. Typically, this has meant being against. If hierarchy worships the established order, the network nurtures a streak of nihilism." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "I was trained, as even the youngest of us were, to think in terms of the old categories: to think, for example, that the direction of American politics depended on the balance between Democrats and Republicans. Yet both parties are, in form and spirit, organizations of the Center. Both are heavily invested in the established order, offering the public minor differences in perspective on the same small set of questions. Surprises in America’s political trajectory are unlikely to come from the alternation of Democrat and Republican." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "For a public to exist it had to achieve self-consciousness—some irritation or dissatisfaction was needed to pry it apart from the elites. For the public to voice its thoughts and opinions, and thus transform itself, potentially, into a political actor, required a means of communication. This became a possibility only after the spread of the printing press." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Of course dictatorships wish to manipulate media of all kinds to influence opinion. In the industrial age, however, they did so boldly and officially, from authority, while under the new dispensation despots must try to impersonate the public to have any hope of influencing it. Instead of injecting slogans into the brains of the masses by means of banner headlines on People’s Daily or a televised speech of the lider maximo, they are now forced to ride the tiger of real opinion, and face the consequences should it turn against them." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "This anxiety to control information in those who already controlled the guns should alert us that political power may be less “hard,” and more intangible, than supposed.
>
> Power, from our perspective, is a particular alignment between the will of the elites and the actions and opinions of the public: a matter of trust, faith, and fear, apportioned variously but involving both sides. Brute force plays a part, but as the fall of the brutal Muammar Qaddafi demonstrated, no government can survive for long solely on the basis of killing its opponents. A significant fraction of the public must find the status quo acceptable, and the larger the number of true believers, the more solid the foundation underneath a regime. Thus the potential influence of information over political power flows more from its fit into stories of legitimacy than from, say, investigative reporting or the dispensing of practical knowledge." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "That single independent channel of information thus holds the potential for radical change. It broadens Homo informaticus’s field of vision to encompass alternative values and systems. Most importantly, it shatters the illusion that his way of life is inevitable and preordained, a first, necessary step toward revolution. Whether revolution will ultimately happen will of course depend on a multitude of factors, many of which have little to do with information. The transition from negative to positive effects must end in nonlinearity, but we can say with confidence that it won’t be triggered unless the public is shown a differently-ordered world: a choice." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "When judging his government, H. informaticus can then do so in light of alternative possibilities—different views of the same policy or event, different values invoked for an action or inaction, different performance by other governments, real or imagined. The first step toward skepticism is doubt, and H. informaticus, exposed to an independent channel, must confront choices and doubts when constructing his story of the world.
>
> As this evolutionary fable approaches the present moment, content proliferates. A vast global information sphere, churning with controversies, points of view, and rival claims on every subject, becomes accessible to our hero. Its volume and variety exceed that of the controlled media by many levels of magnitude. If H. informaticus were to try to absorb this mass, his head would explode. This is not what transpires. He will pick and choose. So will other members of the public. By that very selectivity, that freedom to choose its channels of information, the public breaks the power of the mediator class created by mass media, and, under authoritarian rule, controlled by the regime. 
>
> The fall of the mediators, all things being equal, means the end of the regime’s ability to rule by persuasion. Governments of every stripe have had trouble grasping the sudden reversal in the information balance of power. Proud in hierarchy and accreditation, but deprived of feedback channels, the regime is literally blind to much global content... Most significantly, the regime in its blindness fails to adjust its story of legitimacy to make it plausible in a crowded, fiercely competitive environment.
>
> An accurate representation based on volume would show state media to be microscopic, invisible, when compared to the global information sphere. This is how H. informaticus experiences the changed environment: as an Amazonian flood of irreverent, controversy-ridden, anti-authority content, including direct criticism of the regime.
>
> The consequences are predictable and irreversible. The regime accumulates pain points: police brutality, economic mismanagement, foreign policy failures, botched responses to disasters. These problems can no longer be concealed or explained away. Instead, they are seized on by the newly-empowered public, and placed front-and-center in open discussions. In essence, government failure now sets the agenda.
>
> As the regime’s story of legitimacy becomes less and less persuasive, Homo informaticus adjusts his story of the world in opposition to that of the regime. He joins the ranks of similarly disaffected members of the public, who are hostile to the status quo, eager to pick fights with authority, and seek the means to broadcast their opinions and turn the tables on their rulers.
>
> The means of communication are of course provided by the information sphere. The unit of broadcasting can be a single individual—a Hoder, a Wael Ghonim, any member of the public, including Homo informaticus. The level of reach is billions, distributed across the face of the world. 
>
> At this stage, the public, clustered around networked communities of interest, has effectively taken control of the means of communication. Vital communities revolve around favorite themes and channels, which in the aggregate reveal the true tastes of the public, as opposed to what mass media, corporations, or governments wish the public to be interested in.
>
> Under authoritarian governments, vital communities will tend to coalesce in political opposition as they bump into regime surveillance and control. The regime still controls the apparatus of repression. It can deny service, physically attack, imprison, or even kill H. informaticus—but it can’t silence his message, because this message is constantly amplified and propagated by the opposition community. Since the opposition commands the means of communication and is embedded in the global information sphere, its voice carries beyond the reach of any national government.
>
> This was the situation in Egypt before the uprising of January 25, 2011. This is the situation in China today. The wealth and brute strength of the modern state are counterbalanced by the vast communicative powers of the public. Filters are placed on web access, police agents monitor suspect websites, foreign newscasters are blocked, domestic bloggers are harassed and thrown in jail—but every incident which tears away at the legitimacy of the regime is seized on by a rebellious public, and is then broadcast and magnified until criticism goes viral.
>
> The tug of war pits hierarchy against network, power against persuasion, government against the governed: under such conditions of alienation, every inch of political space is contested, and turbulence becomes a permanent feature of political life.
>
> Objective conditions and the nature of the political system must be accounted for, when it comes to the evolutionary process I have just described. The viciousness of the regime matters. It was safer to protest against Ben Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt than against Qaddafi in Libya or Assad in Syria— or, for that matter, the Kim dynasty in North Korea.
>
> But the rise of Homo informaticus places governments on a razor’s edge, where any mistake, any untoward event, can draw a networked public into the streets, calling for blood. This is the situation today for authoritarian governments and liberal democracies alike. The crisis in the world that I seek to depict concerns loss of trust in government, writ large. The mass extinction of stories of legitimacy leaves no margin for error, no residual store of public good will. Any spark can blow up any political system at any time, anywhere.
>
> I began by posing a question about how something as abstract as information can influence something as real as political power. Let me end the chapter by proposing an answer, in the form of three claims or hypotheses.
>
> 1. Information influences politics because it is indigestible by a government’s justifying story.
>
> 2. The greater the diffusion of information to the public, the more illegitimate any political status quo will appear.
>
> 3. Homo informaticus, networked builder and wielder of the information sphere, poses an existential challenge to the legitimacy of every government he encounters." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Propaganda was the totalitarian’s admission that his power wasn’t total. Unlike democratic politicians, leaders of mass movements lacked feedback mechanisms: they had no idea what the masses were thinking, and could only hope to inject the desired opinions directly into the brains of their followers." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "My story—I repeat—concerns the tectonic collision between a public which will not rule and institutions of authority progressively less able to do so. My misgiving is that democracy will be ground to pieces under the stress. An immense psychological distance separates the two sides, even as they come together in conflict. This gulf is filled with dark matter: distrust. The elites who control the institutions have never really trusted the public, which they considered animalistic and prone to bouts of destructiveness. In effect, they sought to neuter the public by herding it into a mass and attaching it to established hierarchies. A glimpse at any American airport today will confirm that this horror of the top for the bottom has, if anything, grown more intense. What has changed, then, is the public’s distrust for authority—and its increased power, in the age of the Fifth Wave, to translate that distrust into action." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Modern governments can keep an eye on a thousand moving parts, but they can’t predict discontinuity. They can’t comprehend phase change. When the crisis arrives, they are slow to grasp its dimensions. When the effects become palpable, they reflexively reach for the crude tools they have at their disposal, whether or not these will improve the situation. In essence, governments can throw money at unwanted change, or they can hurl bombs and policemen." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Like money and marriage, legitimacy exists objectively because vast numbers of the public agree, subjectively, that it does exist. If enough people change their minds, the authorizing magic is lost." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Authority, as I use the term, flows from legitimacy, derived from monopoly. To some indeterminate degree, the public must trust and heed authority, or it is no authority at all. An important social function of authority is to deliver certainty in an uncertain world. It explains reality in the context of the shared story of the group. For this it must rely on persuasion rather than compulsion, since naked force is a destroyer of trust and faith. The need to persuade in turn explains the institutional propensity for visible symbols of authority—the patrician’s toga, the doctor’s white frock, the financier’s Armani suit. Authority being an intangible quality, those who wield it wish to be recognized for what they are. And they have been, historically, the only actors in the social drama, with the public relegated to the audience, able only to weep or applaud. Authority is an expansion of author, which originally meant something like “initiator”—the active human element in an otherwise inert population. Current structures of authority are a legacy of the industrial age. The public, when it needs answers, turns to institutions rather than to charismatic individuals. These institutions have been subjected to a Taylorist process of rationalization: they are, without exception, top-down, specialized, professionalized, prone to pseudo-scientific rituals and jargon. To enter such a precinct of authority requires a long and costly accreditation process—years of academic education and apprenticeship. Many are called, few are chosen. The elect believe themselves to be unquestioned masters of their special domain— and so they were for many years. From the middle of the nineteenth to the end of the twentieth centuries, the public lacked the means to question, much less contradict, authoritative judgments derived from monopolies of information. Most people in authority today came to their positions in that happy time. On moral as well as intellectual grounds, they dismiss the outsider out of hand. Their reflexive loathing of the amateur trespasser inspired Hoder’s 19½-year sentence and the mutual annihilation lawsuits against Shawn Fanning and Napster. Of course, the ferocity of this response can be explained in part by a fear of losing access to power and money. Authority has been closely associated with both—it’s a natural connection. Power needs accurate intelligence on which to act. Monopoly has always been a position from which to exploit the market. If I stop thinking in generalities and imagine a concrete person in authority, I’ll conjure up a policeman, a politician, a banker. The links between authority on one side and power and money on the other are dense and often invisible to the public. But each exerts a discrete influence on social relations, and of the three, I believe authority to be easily the most consequential. Even in purely practical terms, persuasion has always trumped compulsion or bribery. The authorizing magic of legitimacy can channel social behavior more deeply and permanently than the policeman’s club or the millionaire’s check. These propositions should be considered truisms, but they are not. Not by the public, which, as we have seen, assumes that every failure of authority must be explained by a collusion of money with power...
>
> When asked about the impact of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai was supposed to have responded: “It is too soon to say.” In that one instance, if true, Zhou spoke as an honest political analyst rather than a revolutionary prophet. The crisis of authority hollowing out existing institutions didn’t arise because these institutions prostituted themselves to power or money. That was an explanation after the fact—one that happened to be believed by much of the public and many experts. The fact that needed to be explained, however, was failure: the painfully visible gap between the institutions’ claims of competence and their actual performance. The gap, I maintain, was a function of the limits of human knowledge. It had always been there. What changed was the public’s awareness of it. In the industrial age, the pratfalls of authority had been managed discreetly, camouflaged by the mystique of the expert at the top of his game. Today failure happens out in the open, in public, where everyone can see. With the arrival of the global information sphere, each failure is captured, reproduced, multiplied, amplified, and made to stand for authority as a whole. Crisis has followed logically from the destruction of the persuasive power—the legitimacy and credibility—possessed by established institutions. The focus of this book has been on politics, because I am personally concerned about the future of democracy, but also because I was an analyst of political events for most of my life. That was my own special domain. But I could just as well have made the precarious future of scientific institutions or the universities the overarching theme of my book. The battleground is everywhere. The assault on authority has expanded to virtually every point in the social landscape where an established hierarchy confronts a public in command of the new platforms of communication." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Much has been claimed for the scientific method, but the only method to which all scientists subscribe is the peer review process. It too has been under strain. Peer review presupposes the existence of independent-minded experts who evaluate manageable data sets. Often, in the age of the Fifth Wave, neither condition applies. Scientists today work in teams, and the subject matter can be so specialized that only a handful of individuals will be able to understand and review the literature. Authors and reviewers can trade places in a chummy circle of mutual admiration and protection. In extreme cases, this constriction of knowledge leads to what one analyst has called “research cartels,” which actively stifle minority or unorthodox views.
>
> At the same time, as in every other domain, the volume of data which must be reviewed has proliferated beyond the capacity of the establishment to absorb. Complicated computer programs have become necessary to array and model the data, and high-level statistical skills are routinely required to assess the validity of any finding. Many scientists, including reviewers, have not been up to the job. The peer review process, relic of a simpler time, has thus become progressively less able to guarantee the integrity and legitimacy of research in many fields of science.
>
> Since 1919, in sum, the practice of science migrated from the sectarian Border, where Einstein clearly originated, to a Center dominated by large, bureaucratic institutions. Practicing scientists were absorbed into hierarchies responsive to command from the top. The distance between professional and amateur—Einstein, let us recall, was one of the latter—grew immensely, and the usual barriers were erected to keep out trespassers from the inner temple of authority. The cost of scientific journals, for example, became prohibitive, so that only institutions could afford a subscription. Titles and tenure and awards proliferated. In this regard, the behavior of the scientific establishment paralleled that of government, the news industry, and the other institutions of the industrial age. All claimed monopolies over information to justify an assertion of unquestioned authority.

> "The emails showed the world’s leading climatologists busily working to organize a research cartel. Peer review was a legitimate source of authority when the process supported their positions. It was compromised, if not malicious, when it offered critics of the orthodoxy a platform. The wish to crush dissenting views, in their minds, had become indistinguishable from the pursuit of truth. In this attempt they ultimately failed, but not, the emails revealed, for lack of trying." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "People on the left believe that science is a tool of Big Business, that scientists are willing to poison us with genetically modified food and torture laboratory animals to earn a bigger profit for their paymasters. This may be an exaggeration, but, as a general proposition, it’s accurate enough. Corporations undeniably pay for and control a substantial percentage of all scientific research.
>
> For people on the right, science has become the handmaiden of Big Government, raising climate and environmental scares to justify the imposition of ever more restrictive political controls over every aspect of life. And this, too, while overstating the case, is generally correct. Government favor is the single most important factor in science research today. It’s disingenuous to imagine that such favor would be granted without considerations of power and political advantage." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The public can strike at a corporation, ferociously and with the speed of light, when it feels that its peculiar interests have been threatened. An example was the backlash against GoDaddy, after that company announced its support of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a measure which sought to expand the reach of copyright law over web content. A boycott organized online was so successful that within 24 hours GoDaddy had caved in and proclaimed its opposition to SOPA. The incident was short-lived: once GoDaddy changed its stand, the protests ended. But it demonstrated the public’s ability to unleash chaos on the marketplace, if it were interested in doing so." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Beyond the intrusion of business consultants skimming billions off their corporate clients, little has changed structurally since Henry Ford’s day. If change does arrive—if the speed and freedom of networking can somehow be wedded to the mass and stability of hierarchy—it will represent a transformation in human relations as radical as any in history. Until that apocalyptic moment, I imagine that the savage churning of corporate births and deaths will continue to accelerate." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "If I were a doctor attempting to diagnose this particular sickness—the crisis of authority—I would look for definite causal patterns and symptoms. Among the patterns I would include exaggerated expectations by the public, abetted by exaggerated claims of competence by authority. I must believe that seismologists can save me from earthquakes, that the chairman of the Fed has tamed the business cycle: and these authorities must either believe the same thing, or, at a minimum, collude in my delusions.
>
> A second causal pattern would be the elites’ loss of control over the story told about their performance, particularly when it has failed to meet expectations. Such control, I noted, is a function of monopoly, so another way to diagnose this pattern is to determine whether the public has broken the institutions’ grip on information and communication. Climatologists conspiring to silence dissident views must believe that their data is a professional secret and their private emails are inviolable, while the public must be able to see the emperor in all his nakedness, and to disseminate that unimpressive image globally. The effect will be a growing distrust and loss of legitimacy.
>
> A third pattern would be the rise of alternative centers of authority. This is a corollary of the loss of monopoly. Once the conversation broadens and the public takes command, the dynamic isn’t that of Einstein scrutinizing the cosmos from his mountaintop, but of Michael Mann and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change looking over their shoulders at Steve McIntyre and his blog. Each vital community formed by amateurs interested in an affair becomes a threat to the authority of the institutions." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The political and expert classes claimed competence over settled truth. That’s who they were, what they did: they produced certainty and erased doubt. But if certainty is a function of authority, then a symptom of authority’s decline will be a radical and generalized uncertainty surrounding important questions. Alas, no instrument exists to measure certainty or its lack: but it is instructive to compare our mindset on this question with that of our parents and grandparents.
>
> Sixty years ago, Einstein spoke with the voice of God. Thirty years ago, Walter Cronkite every day told us “the way it is,” and the New York Times delivered to our doorsteps “All the news that’s fit to print.” Twenty years ago, Alan Greenspan applied infallible formulas to ensure our prosperity. When I was a boy and factual disputes arose in my family, they were settled by consulting the Encyclopedia Britannica. Back then, the world of information was shaped like a pyramid. Those at the top decided signal from noise, knowledge from fraud, certainty from uncertainty. The public and mass media embraced this arrangement. All things being equal, authority was trusted and relied on.
>
> Today we drown in data, yet thirst for meaning. That world-transforming tidal wave of information has disproportionately worsened the noise-to-signal ratio. According to Taleb, “The more data you get, the less you know what’s going on.” 67 And the more you know, the less you trust, as the gap between reality and the authorities’ claims of competence becomes impossible to ignore. If the IPCC climatologists fear a dispute with skeptics, how can they be believed? If the Risk Commission seismologists can’t warn us about catastrophic risk, who will? As I tried to show in this chapter, the public has lost faith in the people on whom it relied to make sense of the world—journalists, scientists, experts of every stripe. By the same process, the elites have lost faith in themselves.

> And the magisterial Encyclopedia Britannica? Gone the way of the dodo. Its place has been taken by Wikipedia, which, with its “edits” and “reverts” for many entries, leaves the reader uncertain about the agenda of any given version.
>
> Lack of certainty isn’t ignorance: it’s a splinter of doubt festering in all we know, a radical disillusionment with the institutions of settled truth.

> "Uncertainty, in this struggle, reflects a negation of the standing structures of knowledge. Impermanence signifies the demolition of the current structures of power and money. A large empty space, a conceptual hole, a nothingness, is in the process of creation, where once a complex society wrestled institutionally with its own contradictions and fallacies. Liberal democracy has been the chief mechanism for mediating such internal flaws. The question of nihilism, now inextricably tangled with the crisis of authority, will be answered in terms which either affirm or negate the legitimacy of the democratic process." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The aims of democratic government have shifted, even if the language of politics has yet to catch up. High modernist government was an austere prophet, demanding the destruction of the muddled present to make room for the perfect future. Late modernist government is more like a kindly uncle, passing out chocolate chip cookies to his favorite nieces and nephews. He doesn’t wish to transform them. He just wants them to be happy—most particularly, with him.
>
> If high modernism in power was an engine of perfection, late modernism has become a happiness machine. It feels bound to intervene anywhere it has identified groups that were somehow victimized, disabled, troubled, below average, offended, uncomfortable—actually or potentially unhappy. Its actions are the political equivalent of handing out a chocolate chip cookie: government today desperately wishes to be seen doing something, anything, to help, and be recognized for its good intentions. There are no boundaries to intervention, but no epic outcomes either. Elected officials know perfectly well that the public is on the move, and are terrified of the consequences. Their chief ambition is to persuade us that they feel our pain, are on our side, have given a little money to our favorite cause, if only we, the public, allow them to last out their terms in peace." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

Hierarchy, slow to respond and easy to surprise, has lost the argument in the information sphere before it began. Trust and legitimacy have bled away from those whose task it is to summon the collective will to action. Rulers everywhere are pale, trembling prisoners of their own rhetoric.

> "A vast structural collision—pre-eminently, the revolt of the public against authority—has left democratic governments burdened with failure, democratic politics far removed from reality, and democratic programs drained of creative energy, and thus of hope. At this point, the nihilist makes his appearance. He is not a philosopher with an elaborated ideology, or a political figure leading an organization. Membership in the Nihilist Party cannot be had for love or money. Rather, the nihilist is merely reacting, as all human beings must, to the pressures applied by his environment: which means, in this case, that he is acting to destroy that environment.
>
> If I’m correct with this line of analysis, the nihilist, while essentially at war with himself, will happily bring down the entire edifice of democracy as part of his suicide pact. He has taken radicalism to its logical extreme.

That has been the business of Christian bishops and White House press secretaries: to impose the justifying story on the chaos of events. But we have seen that the evolution of technology hasn’t been kind to mediators. The public’s conquest of the information sphere has meant the overthrow of the gatekeepers —often accompanied by the collapse of the stories which imbued their institutions with authority and prestige." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

Deep beneath the mass extinction of justifying stories, beneath the failure of government and the living death of democracy, the slow- motion collision of the public against authority, at once cause and consequence of those surface dramas, grinds on. Elites can’t preserve a status quo that the public is unwilling to transform. Turbulence sweeps the landscape but never arrives at the next stage, as if the world-historical clock, the Big Ben of human events, has stopped dead at midnight. That is where we are today. We may be here a long time yet." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

It must erupt out of the depths and become personal. By this I mean that, in a world of contingent outcomes, each of us will be faced with choices, and that our choices will come wrapped in a fatal question.
>
> The choices are the obvious ones of picking sides, of involvement and non- involvement. The question will relate to the vastness of the system within which the conflict is taking place, and the smallness of each person. If modern government, for all its wealth and power, can’t ordain the future of complex systems, what difference can it possibly make whether we, in our smallness, embrace one side or the other, choose this rather than that?" - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The habits of high modernism have led to certain default assumptions: that only the top of the pyramid can impose meaningful social, political, and economic change, for example. Only the highest reaches of government, therefore, have the capacity to choose the path ahead. The rest of us belong to the inert masses. These assumptions were always undemocratic in spirit, but, more importantly, they have been falsified by the experience of the last 50 years. Heroic top-down initiatives have failed, habitually and in their own terms. The masses have awakened to political life in the unruly public, and the tremendous energies released by the Fifth Wave have surged entirely from below. Ideologies justifying hierarchical control over society have faltered, fallen, and begun to go extinct.
>
> The central theme of this book has been the war of the two worlds, high and low, but that has entailed a radical reversal of roles, with amateurs, people from nowhere, swarming up the slopes of the pyramid to trample on the preserves of the chosen few. The simple world of the public, now networked and online, has thoroughly perturbed the complex system administered, for better or worse, by the elites. The question I have is whether the two spheres can be brought into better alignment from the perspective of representative democracy." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Industrial organization, with its cult of the expert and top-down interventionism, stands far removed from the democratic spirit, and has proven disastrous to the actual practice of representative democracy. It has failed in its own terms, and has been seen to fail, and it has infected democratic governments with a paralyzing fear of the public and with the despair of decadence." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Politics is nothing like baseball. In the end, the most persuasive story wins, not the highest score. That is true whenever government tries to impose a specific outcome on a complex system. In the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, for example, the tally of dead American military personnel has been used as a surrogate measure, but the success or failure of war policies have depended entirely on who wins the argument about the rightness of the cause." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "In the best of all possible circumstances, government will assume the shape that dominates the imagination of a historical period. Modern government, creature of the industrial age, would give way to networked government, able to exploit “small world” links to reduce, formally, the distance between power and the public. Political issues—proposed legislation, for example—would be debated and resolved on a much vaster virtual stage, on which ordinary people, no less than elected or bureaucratic elites, have their say. The output of government would be crowd- sourced and thus sanity-checked." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Alternatively, government can opt to participate in its historical realignment with the public, and retain a measure of control by moving information online in ways that are legible to the bottom of the pyramid. Even if interactivity—the back-and-forth of a truly networked system—is restricted, the production process of government can be made manifest at every step. Networked government, I said, is today a utopian ideal: open government, in my judgment, remains a possibility." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Brevity from government isn’t a crazy dream. If our grandparents could deliver Social Security in 37 pages, we can produce much less consequential tax or budgetary decisions on a similar scale. It’s the government’s call.

> That is only one speculative illustration of what might happen if government chose to work its drafts out in the open, online. The legal and pseudo-technical jargon clogging most official communications would also be reduced to a minimum. The current incentives for opaqueness would be replaced by a need for persuasiveness. Bureaucracy would behold itself through the cold eyes of the public. That alone might be transformative. The interventions and interpretations of regulators would be compared, transparently, to the original intent of a law. Instead of 11,000 agency websites there would a single matrixed .gov web, extending as deep into the global information sphere as our elected officials can tolerate.
>
> This can be tried step-by-step. It can be embraced sequentially by portions of the Federal government in a rare shot at trial and error. But something along these lines will either be done by the government or likely will be done to it. The public is on the move. The age, recall, is stuck at midnight. I don’t do prophecy, so call it speculation: but I feel certain that, to the extent government stands aloof from the global information sphere, to that exact degree the information sphere, in the form of Tea Party-like revolts and Wikileaks-style revelations, will burst back, uninvited and destructive, into the precincts of power." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "By placing before the public the early drafts of government business, elected officials and their expert-bureaucrats will bring themselves down to earth. They will allow the public to catch them in the act of making assumptions, trade-offs, best guesses. Government will be demystified, as nature was after the scientific revolution. This will temper the public’s expectations of the outcome. If the minutes of the Risk Commission’s meeting in L’Aquila had been immediately posted online, the criminal prosecutions that ensued probably would have been avoided: scientific failure would have been understood to be a consequence of the limits of human knowledge.

> "Some have gone over the edge. Failure has bred frustration, frustration has justified negation, and negation has paved the way for the nihilist, who acts, quite sincerely, on the principle that destruction of the system is a step forward, regardless of alternatives." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Fukuyama, a Hegelian, argued that Western democracy had run out of “contradictions”: that is, of ideological alternatives. That was true in 1989 and remains true today. Fukuyama’s mistake was to infer that the absence of contradictions meant the end of history. There was another possibility he failed to consider.
>
> History could well be driven by negation rather than contradiction. It could ride on the nihilistic rejection of the established order, regardless of alternatives or consequences. That would not be without precedent. The Roman Empire wasn’t overthrown by something called “feudalism”—it collapsed of its own dead weight, to the astonishment of friend and foe alike. The centuries after the calamity lacked ideological form. Similarly, a history built on negation would be formless and nameless: a shadowy moment, however long, between one true age and another.
>
> The end of the Cold War, in which Fukuyama discerned the millennial triumph of democracy, appears in hindsight to have been the high-water mark for the prestige and legitimacy of this system. Once the external pressure applied by communism was removed, democratic countries lost their internal cohesion, and began the slow descent into negation. The failures of high modernism became painfully evident, when detached from the epic canvas of a life-and-death struggle. The industrial mode of organization, with its militaristic respect for rank, had placed democratic government at a great distance from the governed. Lacking a shared enemy and the urgency of a war footing, public and authority discovered they stood on the opposite sides of many questions.
>
> Then the Fifth Wave swept over the political landscape, giving voice and image and persuasive power to the insistent negations of the public. The result, if my analysis has any validity, has been the bleeding out of legitimacy and living death of many democratic institutions." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The democratic process is in peril of self-negation. The public’s mood swings are driven by failures of government, not hope for change. Each failure bleeds legitimacy from the system, erodes faith in the machinery of democracy, and paves the way for the opposite extreme. Democracy lacks true rivals today as an ideal and an ideology. Fukuyama was indeed half right. But there is a decadence in certain historical moments, an entropy of systems, propelled by an internal dynamic, that makes no demands for alternative ideals or structures before the onset of disintegration. At some point, failure becomes final." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Extremist kooks and cranks have always enjoyed wild conspiracy-mongering more than dull reality. With the collapse of the mediator class, this toxic mindset is seeping into the mainstream. When the neo-Nazis of The Stormer look on America, they see a “race war” against whites and “filthy Jew terrorists” in charge of the government. That is crazed bigotry posing as truth. But when the elites look on the neo-Nazis, they don’t see a tiny band of attention-starved bigots: they discern instead the awful consequences of Donald Trump in power. Nazis become a symbolic judgment on Trump—much as, for Trump, electoral fraud is a symbolic judgment on his enemies. Even if objectively false, both propositions embody truth as it should be. Once that door is open, strange things start to happen. The very liberal news media has glamorized neo-Nazis and racialists by lavishing attention on them wholly disproportionate to their numbers, making creepy marginal characters seem like important actors in US politics." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The recovery of truth requires the restoration of trusted authority." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "To have any hope of reversing this trend, the elites must counter negation with a positive vision—a shared adventure—that includes and persuades the public. Politicians must tell a story about the world that stirs the imagination of voters. The people at the top must raise the public’s understanding to a higher plane. In the attempt, however, they will collide head-on with the social imperatives of the system they represent. The industrial model of liberal democracy isn’t particularly democratic in structure. It’s a steep hierarchy that operates in broadcast mode only. The distance between top and bottom is very great. The chasm of distrust will be difficult to bridge. And as elite fear and loathing of the public has increased, so has the craving for distance and isolation.
>
> Elites today have no idea how to speak to the public or what to say to it. They have shown little interest in trying. The hyper-educated individuals who ran the Clinton campaign were utterly indifferent to public opinion: they believed in big data. An algorithm nicknamed “Ada” delivered “simulations” of opinion to the campaign staff. 127 Ada was the public as elites wish it would be: safe, clean, and speaking only when spoken to. The voter in the flesh was clearly perceived by this group as an alien and frightening brute. His very existence was deplorable. The shock of Election Day followed naturally from such distortions of distance." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Once government goes digital, it becomes possible to alter its structure, even to redirect its purpose. As imagined by the Pirate Party of Iceland, government can evolve into more of a transactional platform—part Facebook page, part Amazon marketplace—and less of an all-knowing solver of problems. Political expectations would be drastically adjusted. So would the relationship of information and power, reversing, at last, the pathological imbalances of the Fifth Wave. Direct democracy, in the form of referendums, would be invoked regularly, to good ends and bad.
>
> To ask why these changes aren’t happening is to circle back to the beginning of the conversation. The people at the top are unable and unwilling to reform or adapt. The distance to the bottom has protected the elites from their own inertia and decadence. If, as the evidence suggests, that distance is rapidly decreasing, then an entire ruling class, and a familiar mode of dealing with and talking about politics and the uses of power, face the possibility of extinction." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The revolt of the public... is a technology-driven churning of new people and classes, a proliferation and confusion of message and noise, utopian hopes and nihilistic rage, globalization and disintegration, taking place in the unbearable personal proximity of the web and at a fatal distance from political power." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The great motive power of the revolt isn’t economic resentment but outrage over distance and failure. Everyday life is increasingly digital and networked. From dating to hailing a cab, most social and commercial transactions occur at the speed of light. This mode of life incessantly collides with the lumbering hierarchies we have inherited from the industrial age. Modern government, above all, is institutionally unable to grasp that it has lost its monopoly over political reality. It behaves as if imposture and depravity will never be found out: but under the digital dispensation, everything is found out. The public is accustomed to proximity but finds the exercise of power removed an impossible distance away: reasons are never given, questions are never answered...
>
> The immediate target of revolt is an elite class that has failed persistently, on its own terms. The elites once were wrapped in the mantle of authority and delivered grandiose national projects, but now the public knows them too well, and they can only mutter and stammer, demoralized. They loathe the public for their humiliation. Politicians have lost faith in the idea of service, or the common interest, or the promotion of some universal cause or ideology: they exist, in office, merely to survive, or more accurately to be seen surviving, to suck up the attention of mass and social media. It has come to pass that presidents are chosen from the casts of reality TV shows. Political actors more and more resemble the real actors in Hollywood, whose company they keep and whose perverse predilections they seem to share.
>
> ...
>
> Liberal democracy predates the industrial world and is now struggling to survive it. It must shake off many of the forms and the rhetoric of the past 150 years in the manner of a snake shaking off its skin, and for the same reason: in order to grow. The digital universe has brought into being an overactive public whose numbers are unprecedented in human experience. Political room must be found for it somehow. The current elite class is probably unable and certainly unwilling to entertain this transformation. So far as the public is concerned, the elites have forsaken their function and thereby lost any claim to legitimacy.
>
> Yet democracy in a complex society can’t dispense with elites. That is the hard reality of the situation. Much more is involved than a need for specialized or esoteric knowledge. Today’s tastes may run to egalitarianism, but across history and cultures the only way to organize humanity, and get things done, has been through some level of command and control within a formal hierarchy. We are probably hard-wired to respond to this pattern. The pyramid can be made flatter or steeper, and a matrix of informal networks is invariably overlaid on it: but the structural necessity holds. Only a tiny minority can be bishops of the church. This may seem apparent when it comes to running a government or managing a corporation, but it applies with equal strength to the dispensation of certainty and truth.

> If my analysis is anywhere close to the mark, the re-formation of liberal democracy, and the recovery of truth, must wait on the emergence of a legitimate elite class." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "How does one group replace another at the top of the pyramid? The study of social change is burdened with many preconceptions regarding the primacy of economic factors, the exploitation and liberation of minority groups, the rise and fall of the bourgeoisie or the proletariat, and so forth. By a stroke of luck, I lack the erudition to take a stand on any of these weighty subjects. Instead, I’ll revert to an old analytic trick and pose a simpler question.
>
> How is a legitimate hierarchy formed? ...
>
> Hierarchy arises out of a natural impulse to self-improvement, and is legitimate when, in an almost Darwinian manner, it is “selected.”
>
> Ortega held the process to be the driving force of history. The “reciprocal action between the masses and select minorities,” he wrote, “is the fundamental fact of every society and the agent of its evolution for good or evil.” Ortega’s masses we now call the public. By “select minorities” he meant the admirable few: elites who, at their best, lavish their creative energies on the effort to sustain and enrich the fabric of contemporary life. These are the truly superior artists and technologists, preachers and politicians.
>
> In the right relation between elites and the public, the former act as exemplars to the latter. They embody and live out the master narratives. We can think of George Washington returning to his farm after the Revolution as a striking example. Abe Lincoln in his childhood log cabin and Tom Edison chasing the perfect filament also fit the type. It almost didn’t matter what these historic figures were like in person: whether they were lovable or jerks. The outline of their lives had displayed magnificently admirable traits, and previous generations of Americans agreed with Ortega on the power of exemplarity to raise human life to a higher plane.
>
> The quality that sets the true elites apart—that bestows authority on their actions and expressions—isn’t power, or wealth, or education, or even persuasiveness. It’s integrity in life and work. A healthy society is one in which such exemplary types draw the public toward them purely by the force of their example. Without compulsion, ordinary persons aspire to resemble the extraordinary, not superficially but fundamentally, because they wish to partake of superior models of being or doing. The good society, Ortega concluded, was an “engine of perfection.
>
> In a sickly society, the force of exemplarity is reversed. Elites seek to flatter and imitate the public. They make a display of popular tastes and attitudes, even as they retreat behind barricades of bodyguards and metal-detecting machines. This, of course, is what I meant by distance: a moral alienation felt even more keenly than the structural divide.
>
> Relations between top and bottom, Ortega asserted, were “reciprocal.” Elites are in some sense selected by the public. If we were to ask how that selection works, Ortega would reply: by aspiration. When elites fail the test of exemplarity— when, as is the case today, they repel rather than attract—they are unselected. They are stripped of legitimacy and authority...
>
> ... Legitimacy depends on a shared interpretation of events: and to be shared, to be perceived equally by contradictory perspectives, a story must go light on raging at symbolic phantoms in favor of the demonstrable and the concrete.
>
> ...
>
> The present need is for a re-formation of the system and the restoration of authority. The practice of democracy must accommodate the existence of an enormous and super-opinionated public. Political action must approach the speed and proximity expected by an electorate that lives, works, and shops on digital media. The change can occur in many different ways, but a few hard truths are apparent from where I stand. The top-down political style, a relic of the last century, today appears false and fraudulent even when it is sincere. The extension of social distance as a reward for political success is perceived, rightly, as contrary to the democratic spirit. The elites now directing our great institutions are unalterably wedded to top-down control and increased distance from the rabble. Their resistance will make the necessary changes very difficult to achieve.
>
> As members of the public, we—by which I mean you, reader, and I—are not helpless. We are not inert. We retain the power to select and unselect, and we wield that power constantly—not only in our political participation, our votes and donations, but in the books we read, the television we watch, the performances we attend, the products we purchase. If, as I believe, Ortega’s framework of legitimacy was broadly correct, we can replace a failed elite class with another that is worthier of our aspirations. Fundamental change is possible, and can come peacefully and quickly. That’s the good news.

> The big question is where to find a “select minority” that embodies the set of virtues required to lead democracy into the digital age, and can draw the public, by force of example, toward those virtues." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The qualities I would look for among elites to get politics off this treadmill are honesty and humility: old-school virtues, long accepted to be the living spirit behind the machinery of the democratic republic, though now almost lost from sight. The reformers of democracy must learn to say, out loud for all to hear, “This is a process of trial and error,” and, “We are uncertain of the consequences,” and even, “I was wrong.” Elected officials must approximate the ability of scientists and businessmen—and, for that matter, ordinary households —to identify failure and move on. Honesty means that the relationship to truth, as truth is perceived, matters more than ambition or partisan advantage. Humility means that the top of the pyramid looks to the public as a home it will return to rather than a carnivorous species from which to hide. Truth must be spoken even when it hurts the speaker or the audience. Distance must be reduced to a minimum, even at the risk of physical danger." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The crucial move if we are to surmount our predicament isn’t transformation but reorientation, a turn in direction away from top-down control, bureaucratic power, and the high valuation of distance as a reward for political success. Such a reorientation strikes me as perfectly possible.
>
> In the end, everything will hinge on the public: on us. If Ortega was correct, then we have lost the right to rant about our rulers. Instead, we must go about the job of selecting their successors. We can lavish our attention and our energies strictly on politicians who seem unwilling to lie or simplify or distort to advantage. We can identify and raise up those who refuse to climb above us. That’s one fork in the path ahead: another leads to nihilism. Either way, the choice is ours." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

The world cannot be run by such a minority of escaped and re-educated minds alone, with all the rest of the heap against them.

The leaders in every great religious movement have considered it necessary that it should explain itself in the form of history and a cosmogony. It has been felt necessary to say Why? and To what end? Every religion therefore has had to adopt the physical conceptions, and usually also to assume many of the moral and social values, current at the time of its formation. It could not transcend the philosophical phrases and attitudes that seemed then to supply the natural frame for a faith, nor draw upon anything beyond the store of scientific knowledge of its time.

The great majority of human beings have still to see the human adventure as one whole; they are obsessed by the air of permanence and finality in established things; they accept current reality as ultimate reality. As the saying goes, they take the world as they find it." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G. Wells](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1303661h.html)

> "Let us make clear what sort of government we are trying to substitute for the patchwork of to-day. It will be a new sort of direction with a new psychology. The method of direction of such a world commonweal is not likely to imitate the methods of existing sovereign states.

> "The fundamental organization of contemporary states is plainly still military, and that is exactly what a world organization cannot be. Flags, uniforms, national anthems, patriotism sedulously cultivated in church and school, the brag, blare, and bluster of our competing sovereignties, belong to the phase of development the Open Conspiracy will supersede. We have to get clear of that clutter. The reasonable desire of all of us is that we should have the collective affairs of the world managed by suitably equipped groups of the most interested, intelligent, and devoted people, and that their activities should be subjected to a free, open, watchful criticism, restrained from making spasmodic interruptions but powerful enough to modify or supersede without haste or delay whatever is weakening or unsatisfactory in the general direction.
>
> A number of readers will be disposed to say that this is a very vague, undefined, and complicated conception of world government. But indeed it is a simplification. Not only are the present governments of the world a fragmentary competitive confusion, but none of them is as simple as it appears. They seem to be simple because they have formal heads and definite forms, councils, voting assemblies, and so forth, for arriving at decisions. But the formal heads, the kings, presidents, and so forth, are really not the directive heads. They are merely the figure heads. They do not decide. They merely make gestures of potent and dignified acquiescence when decisions are put to them. They are complicating shams. Nor do the councils and assemblies really decide. They record, often very imperfectly and exasperatingly, the accumulating purpose of outer forces. These outer really directive forces are no doubt very intricate in their operation; they depend finally on religious and educational forms and upon waves of gregarious feeling, but it does not in the least simplify the process of collective human activity to pretend that it is simple and to set up symbols and dummies in the guise of rulers and dictators to embody that pretence. To recognize the incurable intricacy of collective action is a mental simplification; to remain satisfied with the pretensions of existing governmental institutions, and to bring in all the problems of their procedure and interaction is to complicate the question.
>
> The present rudimentary development of collective psychology obliges us to be vague and provisional about the way in which the collective mind may best define its will for the purpose of administrative action. We may know that a thing is possible and still be unable to do it as yet, just as we knew that aviation was possible in 1900. Some method of decision there must certainly be and a definite administrative machinery. But it may turn out to be a much slighter, less elaborate organization than a consideration of existing methods might lead us to imagine. It may never become one single interlocking administrative system. We may have systems of world control rather than a single world state. The practical regulations, enforcements, and officials needed to keep the world in good health, for example may be only very loosely related to the system of controls that will maintain its communications in a state of efficiency. Enforcement and legal decisions, as we know them now, may be found to be enormously and needlessly cumbrous by our descendants. As the reasonableness of a thing is made plain, the need for its enforcement is diminished, and the necessity for litigation disappears.
>
> The Open Conspiracy, the world movement for the supercession or enlargement or fusion of existing political, economic, and social institutions must necessarily, as it grows, draw closer and closer to questions of practical control. It is likely in its growth to incorporate many active public servants and many industrial and financial leaders and directors. It may assimilate great masses of intelligent workers. As its activities spread it will work out a whole system of special methods of co-operation. As it grows, and by growing, it will learn the business of general direction and how to develop its critical function. A lucid, dispassionate, and immanent criticism is the primary necessity, the living spirit of a world civilization. The Open Conspiracy is essentially such a criticism, and the carrying out of such a criticism into working reality is the task of the Open Conspiracy. It will by its very nature be aiming not so much to set up a world direction, as to become itself a world direction, and the educational and militant forms of its opening phase will evoke, step by step, as experience is gained and power and responsibility acquired, forms of administration and research and correlation." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

> "But as soon as this time-honoured preoccupation with the allotment of the shares of originators, organizers, workers, owners of material, credit dealers, and tax collectors in the total product, ceases to be dealt with as the primary question in economics; as soon as we liberate our minds from a preoccupation which from the outset necessarily makes that science a squabble rather than a science, and begin our attack upon the subject with a survey of the machinery and other productive material required in order that the staple needs of mankind should be satisfied, if we go on from that to consider the way in which all this material and machinery can be worked and the product distributed with the least labour and the greatest possible satisfaction, we shift our treatment of economic questions towards standards by which all current methods of exploitation, employment, and finance can be judged rather than wrangled over. We can dismiss the question of the claims of this sort of participant or that, for later and subordinate consideration, and view each variety of human assistance in the general effort entirely from the standpoint of what makes that assistance least onerous and most effective.
>
> The germs of such really scientific economics exist already in the study of industrial organization and industrial psychology. As the science of industrial psychology in particular develops, we shall find all this discussion of ownership, profit, wages, finance, and accumulation, which has been treated hitherto as the primary issues of economics, falling into place under the larger enquiry of what conventions in these matters, what system of money and what conceptions of property, yield the greatest stimulus and the least friction in that world-wide system of co-operation which must constitute the general economic basis to the activities of a unified mankind.
>
> Manifestly the supreme direction of the complex of human economic activities in such a world must centre upon a bureau of information and advice, which will take account of all the resources of the planet, estimate current needs, apportion productive activities and control distribution. The topographical and geological surveys of modern civilized communities, their government maps, their periodic issue of agricultural and industrial statistics, are the first crude and unco-ordinated beginnings of such an economic world intelligence. In the propaganda work of David Lubin, a pioneer whom mankind must not forget, and in his International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, there were the beginnings of an impartial review month by month and year by year of world production, world needs and world transport. Such a great central organization of economic science would necessarily produce direction; it would indicate what had best be done here, there, and everywhere, solve general tangles, examine, approve and initiate fresh methods and arrange the transitional process from old to new. It would not be an organization of will, imposing its will upon a reluctant or recalcitrant race; it would be a direction, just as a map is a direction.
>
> A map imposes no will on anyone, breaks no one in to its "policy." And yet we obey our maps.
>
> The will to have the map full, accurate, and up to date, and the determination to have its indications respected, would have to pervade the whole community. To nourish and sustain that will must be the task not of any particular social or economic division of the community, but of the whole body of right-minded people in that community. The organization and preservation of that power of will is the primary undertaking, therefore, of a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity. And through that will it will produce as the central organ the brain of the modern community, a great encyclopædic organization, kept constantly up to date and giving approximate estimates and directions for all the material activities of mankind.
>
> The older and still prevalent conception of government is bullying, is the breaking-in and subjugation of the "subject," to the God, or king, or lords of the community. Will-bending, the overcoming of the recalcitrant junior and inferior, was an essential process in the establishment of primitive societies, and its tradition still rules our education and law. No doubt there must be a necessary accommodation of the normal human will to every form of society; no man is innately virtuous; but compulsion and restraint are the friction of the social machine and, other things being equal, the less compulsive social arrangements are, the more willingly, naturally, and easily they are accepted, the less wasteful of moral effort and the happier that community will be. The ideal state, other things being equal, is the state with the fewest possible number of will fights and will suppressions. This must be a primary consideration in arranging the economic, biological, and mental organization of the world community at which we aim.
>
> We have advanced the opinion that the control of population pressure is practicable without any violent conflict with "human nature," that given a proper atmosphere of knowledge and intention, there need be far less suppression of will in relation to production than prevails to-day. In the same way, it is possible that the general economic life of mankind may be made universally satisfactory that there may be an abundance out of all comparison greater than the existing supply of things necessary for human well-being, freedom, and activity, with not merely not more, but infinitely less subjugation and enslavement than now occurs. Man is still but half born out of the blind struggle for existence, and his nature still partakes of the infinite wastefulness of his mother Nature. He has still to learn how to price the commodities he covets in terms of human life. He is indeed only beginning to realize that there is anything to be learnt in that matter. He wastes will and human possibility extravagantly in his current economic methods.
>
> We know nowadays that the nineteenth century expended a great wealth of intelligence upon a barren controversy between Individualism and Socialism. They were treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, instead of being questions of degree. Human society has been is and always must be an intricate system of adjustments between unconditional liberty and the disciplines and subordinations of co-operative enterprise. Affairs do not move simply from a more individualist to a more socialist state or vice versa; there may be a release of individual initiative going on here and standardization or restraint increasing there. Personal property never can be socially guaranteed as the extremer individualists desired, nor can it be "abolished" as the extremer socialists proposed. Property is not robbery, as Proudhon asserted; it is the protection of things against promiscuous and mainly wasteful use. Property is not necessarily personal. In some cases property may restrict or forbid a use of things that could be generally advantageous, and it may be and is frequently unfair in its assignment of initiative, but the remedy for that is not an abolition but a revision of property. In the concrete it is a form necessary for liberty of action upon material, while abstracted as money, which is a liquidated generalized form of property; it is a ticket for individual liberty of movement and individual choice of reward.
>
> The economic history of mankind is a history of the operation of the idea of property; it relates the conflict of the unlimited acquisitiveness of egoistic individuals against the resentment of the disinherited and unsuccessful and the far less effective consciousness of a general welfare. Money grew out of a system of abstracting conventions and has been subjected to a great variety of restrictions, monopolizations, and regulations. It has never been an altogether logical device, and it has permitted the most extensive and complex developments of credit, debt, and dispossession. All these developments have brought with them characteristic forms of misuse and corruption. The story is intricate, and the tangle of relationships, of dependence, of pressure, of interception, of misdirected services, crippling embarrassments, and crushing obligations in which we live to-day admits of no such simple and general solutions as many exponents of socialism, for example, seem to consider possible.
>
> But the thought and investigations of the past century or so have made it clear that a classification of property, according to the nature of the rights exercisable and according to the range of ownership involved, must be the basis of any system of social justice in the future.
>
> Certain things, the ocean, the air, rare wild animals, must be the collective property of all mankind and cannot be altogether safe until they are so regarded, and until some concrete body exists to exercise these proprietary rights. Whatever collective control exists must protect these universal properties, the sea from derelicts, the strange shy things of the wild from extermination by the hunter and the foolish collector. The extinction of many beautiful creatures is one of the penalties our world is paying for its sluggishness in developing a collective common rule. And there are many staple things and general needs that now also demand a unified control in the common interest. The raw material of the earth should be for all, not to be monopolized by any acquisitive individual or acquisitive sovereign state, and not to be withheld from exploitation for the general benefit of any chance claims to territorial priority of this or that backward or bargaining person or tribe.
>
> In the past, most of these universal concerns have had to be left to the competitive enterprise of profit-seeking individuals because there were as yet no collectivities organized to the pitch of ability needed to develop and control these concerns, but surely nobody in his senses believes that the supply and distribution of staple commodities about the earth by irresponsible persons and companies working entirely for monetary gain is the best possible method from the point of view of the race as a whole. The land of the earth, all utilizable natural products, have fallen very largely under the rules and usages of personal property because in the past that was the only recognized and practicable form of administrative proprietorship. The development both of extensive proprietary companies and of government departments with economic functions has been a matter of the last few centuries, the development, that is to say, of communal, more or less impersonal ownership, and it is only through these developments that the idea of organized collectivity of proprietorship has become credible.
>
> ...
>
> But when we have stipulated for the replacement of individual private ownership by more highly organized forms of collective ownership, subject to free criticism and responsible to the whole republic of mankind, in the general control of sea and land, in the getting, preparation, and distribution of staple products and in transport, we have really named all the possible generalizations of concrete ownership that the most socialistic of contemporaries will be disposed to demand. And if we add to that the necessary maintenance of a money system by a central world authority upon a basis that will make money keep faith with the worker who earns it, and represent from first to last for him the value in staple commodities he was given to understand it was to have, and if we conceive credit adequately controlled in the general interest by a socialized world banking organization, we shall have defined the entire realm from which individual property and unrestricted individual enterprise have been excluded. Beyond that, the science of social psychology will probably assure us that the best work will be done for the world by individuals free to exploit their abilities as they wish. If the individual landowner or mineral-owner disappears altogether from the world, he will probably be replaced over large areas by tenants with considerable security of tenure, by householders and by licensees under collective proprietors. It will be the practice, the recognized best course, to allow the cultivator to profit as fully as possible by his own individual productivity and to leave the householder to fashion his house and garden after his own desire.
>
> Such in the very broadest terms is the character of the world commonweal towards which the modern imagination is moving, so far as its direction and economic life are concerned. The organization of collective bodies capable of exercising these wider proprietorships, which cannot be properly used in the common interest by uncorrelated individual owners, is the positive practical problem before the intelligent portion of mankind to-day. The nature of such collective bodies is still a series of open questions, even upon such points as whether they will be elected bodies or groups deriving their authority from other sanctions. Their scope and methods of operation, their relations to one another and to the central bureau of intelligence, remain also to be defined. But before we conclude this essay we may be able to find precisions for at least the beginning of such definition.
>
> Nineteenth-century socialism in its various forms, including the highly indurated formulae of communism, has been a series of projects for the establishment of such collective controls, for the most part very sketchy projects from which the necessary factor of a sound psychological analysis was almost completely wanting. Primarily movements of protest and revolt against the blazing injustices arising out of the selfishly individualistic exploitation of the new and more productive technical and financial methods of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they have been apt to go beyond the limits of reasonable socialization in their demands and to minimize absurdly the difficulties and dangers of collective control. Indignation and impatience were their ruling moods, and if they constructed little they exposed much. We are better able to measure the magnitude of the task before us because of the clearances and lessons achieved by these pioneer movements." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

It is not a creative effort in a clear field; it is a creative effort that can hardly stir without attacking established things. It is the repudiation of drift, of "leaving things alone." It criticizes everything in human life from the top to the bottom and finds everything not good enough. It strikes at the universal human desire to feel that things are "all right."
>
> One might conclude, and it would be a hasty, unsound conclusion, that the only people to whom we could look for sympathy and any passionate energy in forwarding the revolutionary change would be the unhappy, the discontented, the dispossessed, and the defeated in life's struggle. This idea lies at the root of the class-war dogmas of the Marxists, and it rests on an entirely crude conception of human nature. The successful minority is supposed to have no effective motive but a desire to retain and intensify its advantages. A quite imaginary solidarity to that end is attributed to it, a preposterous, base class activity. On the other hand, the unsuccessful mass—"proletariat"—is supposed to be capable of a clear apprehension of its disadvantages, and the more it is impoverished and embittered, the clearer-minded it becomes, and the nearer draws its uprising, its constructive "dictatorship," and the Millennium.
>
> No doubt a considerable amount of truth is to be found in this theory of the Marxist revolution. Human beings, like other animals, are disposed to remain where their circumstances are tolerable and to want change when they are uncomfortable, and so a great proportion of the people who are "well off" want little or no change in present conditions, particularly those who are too dull to be bored by an unprogressive life, while a great proportion of those who actually feel the inconveniences of straitened means and population pressure, do. But much vaster masses of the rank and file of humanity are accustomed to inferiority and dispossession, they do not feel these things to the extent even of desiring change, or even if they do feel their disadvantages, they still fear change more than they dislike their disadvantages. Moreover, those who are sufficiently distressed to realize that "something ought to be done about it" are much more disposed to childish and threatening demands upon heaven and the government for redress and vindictive and punitive action against the envied fortunate with whom they happen to be in immediate contact, than to any reaction towards such complex, tentative, disciplined constructive work as alone can better the lot of mankind. In practice Marxism is found to work out in a ready resort to malignantly destructive activities, and to be so uncreative as to be practically impotent in the face of material difficulties. In Russia, where—in and about the urban centres, at least—Marxism has been put to the test, the doctrine of the Workers' Republic remains as a unifying cant, a test of orthodoxy of as little practical significance there as the communism of Jesus and communion with Christ in Christendom, while beneath this creed a small oligarchy which has attained power by its profession does its obstinate best, much hampered by the suspicion and hostility of the Western financiers and politicians, to carry on a series of interesting and varyingly successful experiments in the socialization of economic life. Here we have no scope to discuss the N.E.P. and the Five Year Plan. They are dealt with in The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind. Neither was properly Communist. The Five Year Plan is carried out as an autocratic state capitalism. Each year shows more and more clearly that Marxism and Communism are divagations from the path of human progress and that the line of advance must follow a course more intricate and less flattering to the common impulses of our nature.
>
> The one main strand of truth in the theory of social development woven by Marx and Engels is that successful, comfortable people are disposed to dislike, obstruct and even resist actively any substantial changes in the current patchwork of arrangements, however great the ultimate dangers of that patchwork may be or the privations and sufferings of other people involved in it. The one main strand of error in that theory is the facile assumption that the people at a disadvantage will be stirred to anything more than chaotic and destructive expressions of resentment. If now we reject the error and accept the truth, we lose the delusive comfort of belief in that magic giant, the Proletariat, who will dictate, arrange, restore, and create, but we clear the way for the recognition of an élite of intelligent, creative-minded people scattered through the whole community, and for a study of the method of making this creative element effective in human affairs against the massive oppositions of selfishness and unimaginative self-protective conservatism.

> Now, certain classes of people such as thugs and burglars seem to be harmful to society without a redeeming point about them, and others, such as racecourse bookmakers, seem to provide the minimum of distraction and entertainment with a maximum of mischief. Wilful idlers are a mere burthen on the community. Other social classes again, professional soldiers, for example, have a certain traditional honourableness which disguises the essentially parasitic relationship of their services to the developing modern community. Armies and armaments are cancers produced by the malignant development of the patriotic virus under modern conditions of exaggeration and mass suggestion. But since there are armies prepared to act coercively in the world to-day, it is necessary that the Open Conspiracy should develop within itself the competence to resist military coercion and combat and destroy armies that stand in the way of its emergence. Possibly the first two types here instanced may be condemned as classes and excluded as classes from any participation in the organized effort to recast the world, but quite obviously the soldier cannot. The world commonweal will need its own scientific methods of protection so long as there are people running about the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons, offering violence to their fellow men and interfering with the free movements of commodities in the name of national sovereignty.
>
> And when we come to the general functioning classes, landowners, industrial organizers, bankers, and so forth, who control the present system, such as it is, it should be still plainer that it is very largely from the ranks of these classes, and from their stores of experience and traditions of method, that the directive forces of the new order must emerge. The Open Conspiracy can have nothing to do with the heresy that the path of human progress lies through an extensive class war.
>
> Let us consider, for example, how the Open Conspiracy stands to such a complex of activities, usages, accumulations, advantages as constitutes the banking world. There are no doubt many bankers and many practices in banking which make for personal or group advantage to the general detriment. They forestall, monopolize, constrain, and extort, and so increase their riches. And another large part of that banking world follows routine and established usage; it is carrying on and keeping things going, and it is neither inimical nor conducive to the development of a progressive world organization of finance. But there remains a residuum of original and intelligent people in banking or associated with banking or mentally interested in banking, who do realize that banking plays a very important, interesting part in the world's affairs, who are curious about their own intricate function and disposed towards a scientific investigation of its origins, conditions, and future possibilities. Such types move naturally towards the Open Conspiracy. Their enquiries carry them inevitably outside the bankers' habitual field to an examination of the nature, drift, and destiny of the entire economic process.

> Now the theme of the preceding paragraph might be repeated with variations through a score of paragraphs in which appropriate modifications would adapt it to the industrial organizer, the merchant and organizer of transport, the advertiser, the retail distributor, the agriculturalist, the engineer, the builder, the economic chemist, and a number of other types functional in the contemporary community. In all we should distinguish firstly a base and harmful section, then a mediocre section following established usage, and lastly, an active, progressive section to whom we turn naturally for developments leading towards the progressive world commonweal of our desires. And our analysis might penetrate further than separation into types of individuals. In nearly every individual instance we should find a mixed composition, a human being of fluctuating moods and confused purposes, sometimes base, sometimes drifting with the tide and sometimes alert and intellectually and morally quickened. The Open Conspiracy must be content to take a fraction of a man, as it appeals to fractions of many classes, if it cannot get him altogether.
>
> This idea of drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection is a fairly obvious one—and yet it has still to win practical recognition. Man is a morbidly gregarious and partisan creature; he is deep in his immediate struggles and stands by his own kind because in so doing he defends himself; the industrialist is best equipped to criticize his fellow industrialist, but he finds the root of all evil in the banker; the wages worker shifts the blame for all social wrongs on the "employing class." There is an element of exasperation in most economic and social reactions, and there is hardly a reforming or revolutionary movement in history which is not essentially an indiscriminate attack of one functioning class or type upon another, on the assumption that the attacked class is entirely to blame for the clash and that the attacking class is self-sufficient in the commonweal and can dispense with its annoying collaborator. A considerable element of justice usually enters into such recriminations. But the Open Conspiracy cannot avail itself of these class animosities for its driving force. It can have, therefore, no uniform method of approach. For each class it has a conception of modification and development, and each class it approaches therefore at a distinctive angle. Some classes, no doubt, it would supersede altogether; others—the scientific investigator, for example—it must regard as almost wholly good and seek only to multiply and empower, but it can no more adopt the prejudices and extravagances of any particular class as its basis than it can adopt the claims of any existing state or empire.
>
> When it is clearly understood that the binding links of the Open Conspiracy we have in mind are certain broad general ideas, and that—except perhaps in the case of scientific workers—we have no current set of attitudes of mind and habits of activity which we can turn over directly and unmodified to the service of the conspiracy, we are in a position to realize that the movement we contemplate must from the outset be diversified in its traditions and elements and various in its methods. It must fight upon several fronts and with many sorts of equipment. It will have a common spirit, but it is quite conceivable that between many of its contributory factors there may be very wide gaps in understanding and sympathy.

A group or movement of students may find itself capable of little more than self-education and personal propaganda; a handful of middle-class people in small town may find its small resources fully engaged at first in such things as, for example, seeing that desirable literature is available for sale or in local public library, protecting books and news vendors from suppression, or influencing local teachers. Most parents of school children can press for the teaching of universal history and sound biology and protest against the inculcation of aggressive patriotism. There is much scope for the single individual in this direction. On the other hand, a group of ampler experience and resources may undertake the printing, publication, and distribution of literature, and exercise considerable influence upon public opinion in turning education in the right direction." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

A phase when there will be a special educational system for the Open Conspiracy seems, therefore, to be indicated. Its children will learn to speak, draw, think, compute lucidly and subtly, and into their vigorous minds they will take the broad concepts of history, biology, and mechanical progress, the basis of the new world, naturally and easily. Meanwhile, those who grow up outside the advancing educational frontier of the Open Conspiracy will never come under the full influence of its ideas, or they will get hold of them only after a severe struggle against a mass of misrepresentations and elaborately instilled prejudices.

> "The bent for reciprocal exchange is not the only aspect of human nature that helps propel society toward complexity. Evolutionary psychologists—and, for that matter, non-evolutionary psychologists—have shown that human beings naturally pursue social status with a certain ferocity. We all relentlessly, if often unconsciously, try to raise our standing by impressing peers. And we naturally, if unconsciously, evaluate other people in terms of their standing. We especially value the friendship of high-status people (since alliance with the powerful tends to come in handy), and we especially fear their disfavor (since the enmity of the powerful tends not to). Human beings evolved amid social hierarchies, and our minds are designed to negotiate them.
>
> This gives social complexity a head start in at least two ways. First, deference to the high and mighty (though the deference is far from reflexive, as we’ll see) paves the way for complex hierarchical organization. Hunter-gatherer peoples may or may not have a formally designated “headman,” but they recognize a leader when the occasion demands. Just look at how readily a Shoshone “rabbit boss” pops up when the rabbits do.
>
> Second, the ongoing quest for social status is a great spur to cultural innovation. We don’t know who invented the rabbit net, but we can safely assume it didn’t hurt his or her popularity. And so it is in all societies: one sure way to elevate your standing is to create something that is widely adopted and praised.
>
> There is an irony here. To compete for high-status positions is to play a zero-sum game, since they are by definition a scarce resource. Yet one way to compete successfully is to invent technologies that create new non-zero-sum games. This is one of various senses in which the impetus behind cultural evolution, behind social complexification, lies in a paradox of human nature: we are deeply gregarious, and deeply cooperative, yet deeply competitive. We instinctively play both non-zero-sum and zero-sum games. The interplay of these two dynamics throughout history is a story that takes some time to tell. For now I’ll just say that, though they have been responsible for much suffering, the tension between them is, in the end, creative." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The mixture of cooperative and competitive human instincts, the subtle but potent quest for status, the ingenuity it fuels—these were evident long before Darwinian theory came along to explain their reason for being. In the eighteenth century, for example, Immanuel Kant noted the “unsocial sociability” of man, with special emphasis on the “unsocial” part and its ironic consequences. “Through the desire for honor, power or property, it drives him to seek status among his fellows, whom he cannot bear yet cannot bear to leave.”41 Via this quest for status, “the first true steps are taken from barbarism to culture, which in fact consists in the social worthiness of man.” Thus commences “a continued process of enlightenment” as “all man’s talents are now gradually developed, his taste cultivated.”
>
> Without these “asocial qualities (far from admirable in themselves),” human beings “would live an Arcadian, pastoral existence of perfect concord, self-sufficiency and mutual love.42 But all human talents would remain hidden forever in a dormant state, and men, as good-natured as the sheep they tended, would scarcely render their existence more valuable than that of their animals.” In that event, “the end for which they were created, their rational nature, would be an unfilled void. Nature should thus be thanked for fostering social incompatibility, enviously competitive vanity, and insatiable desires for possession or even power.”
>
> Kant made those remarks in an essay called “Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose,” which suggested that human history embodied a “hidden plan of nature.”43 Perhaps as history unfolds, he wrote, we will see “how the human race eventually works its way upward to a situation in which all the germs implanted by nature can be developed fully, and in which man’s destiny can be fulfilled here on earth.” Kant imagined that this destiny would include enduring peace among nations, ensured by a kind of world governance—a final, ironic payoff for millennia of antagonism and “unsocial” striving.
>
> This was all conjecture, Kant stressed. Writing in 1784, before the harnessing of electricity, before the telegraph or typewriter or computer, he admitted that so far there was just “a little” evidence of such a “purposeful natural process.” Only time would tell. “For this cycle of events seems to take so long a time to complete, that the small part of it traversed by mankind up till now does not allow us to determine with certainty the shape of the whole cycle, and the relation of its parts to the whole.” Well, that was then." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

the whole of chapter 4 "the invisible brain" is a worthy quote

> "To say that writing transformed the potential for non-zero-sum interaction comes close to redundancy. For the link between information and non-zero-sumness is so basic that it’s hard to imagine deep changes in the former that wouldn’t deeply change the latter. Indeed, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that non-zero-sum dynamics are the reason information gets transmitted in the first place. As the pioneering game theorist Thomas Schelling has observed, in a purely zero-sum relationship, there is no rational reason to communicate. Opposing coaches have no cause to speak before a game. If you see them in extended conference, they’re probably talking about some non-zero-sum realm, where their interests partly overlap. Both want to avoid injured players, and may decide to reschedule a game in bad weather. But neither coach has an interest in honestly communicating anything about the game itself." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "If indeed barriers to information are one of the two basic impediments to non-zero-sum gain, then obviously new information technologies might unlock some positive sums. Yet the more dramatic effect of writing may have been to overcome the second barrier, the trust barrier. In ancient Mesopotamia, a lender didn’t have to fear that the borrower would deny all recollection of the loan, and the borrower didn’t have to fear that the lender would exaggerate it." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Writing was hardly the only thing in the ancient states of Asia, the Middle East, and Mesoamerica that helped solve the trust problem. Another was the systematization of justice: the assurance that cheaters will be punished. But even here, writing helps; legal codes carry more precision and heft when etched in something solid. The code of the Mesopotamian city of Eshnunna—written a century before the more famous code of Hammurabi—left no doubt what would happen if you paid a man a shekel to harvest your field and he never got around to it: he would pay you ten shekels... So the government had to build a new anti-cheating technology, a new technology of trust—trust not just in economic justice, but in the larger social contract, the mutual nonaggression pact that, by relieving people of fear and suspicion, smooths all kinds of cooperative efforts" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” depends on an invisible brain. And invisible brains depend on information technology. Not just conspicuous information technologies, like the abacus (though its “rediscovery” around A.D. 1,000, after centuries of European neglect, did help) or writing (though the growing literacy of the Middle Ages helped, too) or money (though the revival of currency was vital). At least as crucial was information technology in a subtler sense: what you might call information metatechnologies—social algorithms guiding the use of such information technologies as money. In particular, what made the later Middle Ages a bridge between ancient times and the industrial revolution was the rudimentary metatechnology of capitalism.
>
> Today we take for granted that the people who start a business and the people who provide the money for it are often not the same people. We have stock markets, limited partnerships, bank loans, and various other ways of turning John’s profits into Mary’s seed money. But this basic idea—efficiently converting savings into investment—had to be invented, and at the time the western Roman Empire fell apart, Europe’s machinery for capital formation had been crude. The Middle Ages changed that.
>
> In southern Europe the contratto di commenda, in use by the tenth century, allowed investors large and small to underwrite a ship’s trading expedition. They were guaranteed in writing a share of “the capital and the profit which God shall have granted.” The commenda was just one of many medieval tools for linking savings to investment. (By the fourteenth century, Venetian bankers had realized that they could lend out a fraction of their deposits, since depositers were unlikely to all withdraw their cash at once. The rest is European banking history.) All such instruments had this in common: they were distinct steps toward modern capitalism. Europe had long had markets for goods and services. Now it had markets for capital. It also had new ancillary metatechnologies of capitalism, such as insurance and double-entry bookkeeping.
>
> All to the good. But does this really answer the question of why the economic complexity of the late Middle Ages had been so slow in coming? If the missing ingredients were the various metatechnologies of capitalism, then the question becomes: Why had they taken so long to evolve? After all, once you’ve got coins and writing, all that stands between you and capitalism is a little imagination. In principle, there could have been stock exchanges—which finally showed up in the seventeenth century A.D.—in the seventh century B.C, when the Lydians started coining money. Why did nearly two millennia pass before European capitalism got off the ground?
>
> Maybe part of the answer lies in where exactly it did finally get off the ground: not in Byzantium, where ancient government and social structure endured, but in the west, where central rule collapsed, and tumult came and went and came, and authority was often dispersed. The average ancient ruling class, after all, would have blanched at full-fledged capitalism. For ordinary people to have potent ways of turning savings into investment meant a loss of leverage for aristocrats. What ships and grand buildings to build, and what to do with them—more and more of these decisions would now be made diffusely, by diverse investors and entrepreneurs, not centrally by the government and the entrenched elite. What’s more, the fruits of investment would now be hard to monopolize.
>
> This points to a general problem faced by ruling classes. To stay strong, a society must adopt new technologies. In particular, it must reap the non-zero-sum fruits they offer. Yet new technologies often redistribute power within societies. (They often do this precisely because they raise non-zero-sumness—because they expand the number of people who profit from the system and so wield power within it.) And if there is one opinion common to ruling classes everywhere, it is that power is not in urgent need of redistributing. Hence the Hobson’s choice for the governing elite: accept valuable technologies that may erode your power, or resist them so well that you may find yourself with nothing to govern. Maybe it was western Europe’s freedom from ancient elites that helped hasten the coming of capitalism.
>
> To be sure, western Europe in the Middle Ages, like ancient Rome, had elites who disliked big power shifts. The instinct of feudal lords was to exploit the emerging class of merchants with tolls at bridges and feudal bounds. But it didn’t take merchants long to sense their common interest. They united into guilds and demanded the freedoms necessary for commerce: not just freedom from outrageous tolls, but freedom to buy or sell property, freedom to enter into contracts—and freedom to decide what other freedoms they needed. Increasingly, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, towns won the right of self-government, complete with their own courts and tax collection. What’s more, feudal lords soon realized that local prosperity was good for them, and that prosperity required a bit of this freedom. Some started not just granting charters of self-governance to towns, but founding towns in order to grant the charters.
>
> Why were these ruling elites more open to change than Rome’s ruling elites? One reason, some historians say, was the decentralized nature of feudalism. Feudal lords often had the leeway to rewrite the rules in their territory, and they also had the incentive—competition with neighboring lords. As savvy lords tried to foster more prosperity than their neighbors, the many fractal units of feudalism became, in effect, laboratories for non-zero-sumness, competing with each other to raise productivity. This creative tension is what forced rural aristocrats to strike their dangerous bargain with capitalism: fostering the power of the merchant class as an asset in external competition, thus empowering upstart urbanites who might then turn around and challenge aristocratic dominance." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The story of the Middle Ages is the story of new technologies of non-zero-sumness restructuring society in their image. Their upshot ran counter to, and ultimately prevailed over, the generic ambitions of ancient imperial regimes. Once the synergistic power of these technologies crystallized in the form of capitalism, they would allow the entire populace—including descendants of slaves and serfs—to play complex non-zero-sum games with people they would never meet. The bounty would not fall evenly across the populace, but it would fall more evenly than bounty in that part of the world was accustomed to falling. Political power would be more widely diffused than any ancient imperial government had been prepared to contemplate.
>
> This basic drama—the aggrandizing instincts of powerful people versus the decentralizing tendencies of technology, especially information technology—would play out again and again. By that I don’t just mean that free markets would clash recurrently with old regimes, and would win and finally permeate the world (though that seems to be one story line of the past half-millennium). I mean that new information technologies in general—not just money and writing—very often decentralize power, and this fact is not graciously conceded by the powers that be. Hence a certain amount of history’s turbulence, including some in the current era." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "At the end of the Middle Ages, as monolithic China turned inward, Europe was crystallizing into a land of nation-states, and so its contentious dynamism persisted. By their nature, Europeans were just as capable of formulating self-defeating policies as Ming emperors were. It’s just that, in a more immediately competitive environment, someone else was bound to try a better policy, so bad policies came back to haunt you sooner. And once somebody did try a good idea, it could spread to competing polities fast by emulation.
>
> Columbus himself illustrates the point. He sought Portuguese financing, but the king of Portugal turned him down—rather as the Chinese government had decided half a century earlier that long westward voyages weren’t worthwhile. But there was one difference: Portugal, unlike China, had lots of neighbors that were a stone’s throw away. Columbus went to Spain, got support, and came back from the New World triumphant. Within a few years Portugal was playing the discover-America game, too. The “sail westward” meme, having proved its value, proliferated.
>
> As consequential as this meme was, the more important thing, for this book’s purposes, is how memes in general exploited the political landscape of Europe. In this hothouse of interstate competition, technologies of energy, of materials, of information—including algorithms of capitalism and of political governance—were bound to keep sprouting and spreading. For example, patent rights, which helped make initiative worthwhile, were granted in Venice in 1474 and diffused to much of Europe by the middle of the next century.
>
> In this light, Europe’s eventual triumph is not just consistent with a directional theory of cultural evolution; the theory virtually predicts such a triumph. After all, the speed of any evolutionary process depends heavily on two factors: how fast potentially fruitful novelties arise, and how fast manifestly fruitful novelties spread. Europe in the fifteenth century, teeming with competitive but mutually communicative polities, scored higher in both categories than any other part of Eurasia. In such a setting the “sail westward” meme—and profitable memes in general—were (a) likely to take root in one polity or another; and (b) having proved their worth, likely to spread.
>
> ...
>
> All told, if the key to the “European Miracle” lies in geography, it is not so much Europe’s and China’s relative proximity to America as it is Europe’s and China’s political geographies.

The lower the cost of transmitting information, the more broadly and intricately productive a society’s invisible brain can be, both in the short-run sense of everyday economics and the long-run sense of technological advance.

This is truly a trend worth celebrating—especially if you recall the starker concentrations of power that (so far as we can tell) were common in chiefdoms and ancient states.

> Finding predictive value in trends makes me guilty of “historicism.” According to Popper, historicism involves the belief that insight into the future can be had by discovering “the ‘rhythms’ or the ‘patterns,’ the ‘laws’ or the ‘trends’ that underlie the evolution of history.” Popper considered historicism not just misguided, but dangerous. For example, people persecuted under Hitler were victims “of the historicist superstitions of the Third Reich.” Popper failed to note that by his definition the Enlightenment-era thinkers who founded American democracy, with their progressivist view of history and their attendant sense of mission, harbored “historicist superstitions” as well.

If it is, then maybe extrapolating from trends isn’t quite the muddled and heinous endeavor that Popper alleged it to be.

> "With the coming of TV, the computer, the microcomputer, and allied technologies, this century has seen breakthroughs in information technology that rival all past such breakthroughs, even the inventions of writing, money, and the printing press. Given the centrality of information technology to non-zero-sumness, and the centrality of non-zero-sumness to social structure, is it possible that we are passing through a true threshold, a change as basic as the transitions from hunter-gatherer village to chiefdom, from chiefdom to ancient state?
>
> And if so, what lies on the other side? Is it the promised land? After eons of oppression can liberty at last blossom worldwide? After millennia of mindless strife can there be peace?...
>
> For the basic arrow of history—the conversion of non-zero-sumness into sums that are on balance positive, and the attendant creation of yet more non-zero-sumness—does seem to have entailed a certain kind of moral progress. By this I don’t mean that savages are savage, barbarians barbaric, and civilized peoples civilized. Indeed, it would be hard to argue that there was net moral gain between the hunter-gatherer and ancient-state phases of cultural evolution. The Egyptians had slaves—which virtually no known hunter-gatherer societies had—and their soldiers returned from wars of conquest proudly brandishing the severed penises of slain foes." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "As we’ve seen, in the process of expanding, non-zero-sumness has brought not only more respect for more people, but more liberty for more people. The point isn’t just—as such thinkers as Adam Smith have been saying since the eighteenth century—that free markets are best operated by free minds. The point is that the ongoing evolution of information technology heightens this synergy, underscores it, makes it something rulers can less and less afford to ignore.

> "World government—a single, centralized, planetary authority—may or may not arrive, but something firm enough to warrant the name world governance is in the cards. World governance, you might say, is human destiny, the natural outgrowth of the millennia-old expansion of non-zero-sumness among human beings." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The reason to expect the eventual triumph of global governance lies in three observations. (1) Governance has always tended to expand to the geographic scope necessary to solve emerging non-zero-sum problems that markets and moral codes can’t alone solve. (2) These days many emerging non-zero-sum problems are supranational, involving many, sometimes all, nations. (3) The forces behind this growing scope of non-zero-sumness are technological and, for plain reasons, bound to intensify." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Today, as commerce swamps the borders of nation-states, there are many sources of potential friction and disruption. One is trade disputes, which carry the threat of trade wars. Another, put on display during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, is lack of “transparency,” of good financial data about ostensibly healthy nations—a shortcoming that can lead finally to a panicked and ruinous exit of foreign investment.
>
> Both of these problems raise the “trust” barrier to non-zero-sum gain. And trust barriers generally get breached by governance in one sense or another. Among the emerging institutions of world governance that address these particular trust problems are the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. The WTO rules on trade disputes (much as national courts resolve quarrels between companies, though with less binding authority, at least for now). The International Monetary Fund lends money to troubled nations to prevent panics (the rough global analogue of a nation’s bank deposit insurance) and tries in exchange to get sound management and clean bookkeeping—transparency.
>
> It is easy to laugh at nationalist fanatics who see these bodies as embryonic threats to free nations everywhere, who rail against the “secret tribunals” of the World Trade Organization. Chances are, after all, that your home has never been searched by an officer wearing a badge that says “IMF” or “WTO.”
>
> Still, if what authority these bodies do have exists in response to increasingly non-zero-sum relations among nations, and if technology is very likely to sustain this trend, then it doesn’t take a wild-eyed visionary to imagine more and more authority migrating to the global level. Indeed, the Asian financial crisis, by reminding the world of its interdependence, brought calls for stronger international authority from such non-wild-eyed people as the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. As the New York Times summarized the post-Asia conventional wisdom, “only the most dogmatic free market ideologues think the increasingly integrated global economy can get by without a super-national organization to serve as financial watchdog, scold, mediator and lender of last resort.”
>
> Watchdog, scold, mediator, lender—these don’t sound very forceful. But to be a “lender of last resort”—to lend when the private sector refuses to—is to subsidize, and with subsidy comes power. Indeed, much of the American government’s power over states consists not of legalized coercion, but of strings attached to subsidies. Mainstream plans for post-Asia reforms of the IMF followed this model of government control—a stronger role as lender of last resort, along with tighter strings: more financial disclosure, more fiscal discipline, closer regulation of banking.
>
> As the Asian crisis subsided, the more ambitious of these plans began to fade. Even so, by the spring of 1999, the IMF had voted to set up a permanent “contingent credit line” for emergency use by countries that had met IMF standards of transparency and austerity. Since countries certified as eligible for these bailouts will presumably have an easier time attracting foreign capital, there will be a firm incentive to pass muster. Thus the “contingent credit line,” however tenuous it sounds, may evolve into a systematic extension of IMF power.
>
> And bear in mind that supranational lending institutions, even when their influence is more ad hoc, can seem plenty coercive to nations badly in need of a loan. Here is a sentence from a 1998 issue of the Asian Wall Street Journal: “The World Bank plans to oppose a South Korean government plan to set up a fund to buy equity stakes in troubled companies, probably dooming the proposal.” To the South Koreans, this leverage no doubt felt strikingly like supranational authority.
>
> Also bear in mind that loose organizations which solve non-zero-sum problems have a history of foreshadowing firmer authority. In the nineteenth century, various Italian states harmonized their tariff schedules, deepening economic integration and easing the eventual march toward national political unity. Who knows what could eventually become of the World Trade Organization?
>
> This is in one sense a silly comparison. Economics was hardly the only force at work in nineteenth-century Italy. That other great mixer of non-zero-sum cement, hostility toward an alien power (Austria), played a role. Clearly, such hostility won’t be a factor in the evolution of world governance, assuming any extraterrestrials out there continue to keep their distance.
>
> Indeed, for political conglomeration to take place without war either in the backdrop, as a threat, or front and center, as a reality, would mark a contrast not just with Italian and German history, but with history, period—and, for that matter, with prehistory. As we’ve seen, when social organization moved to the supravillage level of the chiefdom, fighting very often, if not always, figured in. Sometimes the fighting was local, with one village chief conquering the others and thus becoming founder of a chiefdom. But when the merger happened less coercively—as one would hope in the case of world governance—an enemy seems to have loomed outside the chiefdom.
>
> The United States, it is true, moved from a loose confederation to a true nation during peacetime. But it was war that had pushed the states over the threshold to confederation, and the specter of future war figured in the arguments for centralization laid out in the Federalist Papers.

> In short, if space aliens don’t attack the planet, yet it nonetheless moves toward firm supranational governance, the transition will be without known precedent. Still, there are two big reasons not to rule out such an aberration." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "First, nations trade with one another (non-zero-sum game number one). Then they see further gains in mutually lowering tariffs (game number two). Then they decide all would benefit by dampening quarrels over what qualifies as a violation of this agreement, so they set up a way to settle disputes (game number three). Crossing this last threshold—forming an inchoate judiciary—is what turned the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the World Trade Organization.
>
> But adjudication entails tricky questions. For example: How do you handle covert trade barriers? When a country makes it illegal to import shrimp caught in nets that kill sea turtles, is that really an environmental law, as advertised, or protectionism in disguise? Both the EU and the WTO weigh in on such matters. Thus did the WTO wind up telling the United States to quit barring shrimp imports from several Asian nations. In theory, the U.S. could have ignored the ruling. All the WTO would have done in response is to approve retaliatory tariffs by aggrieved countries—tariffs those countries could levy even without the WTO’s blessing. Still, the U.S. has benefited from so many WTO rulings that it has a stake in preserving respect for them. This, really, is the whole idea behind governance: the voluntary submission of individual players to an authority that, by solving nonzero-sum problems, can give out in benefits more than it exacts in costs. This net benefit is why WTO rulings may well become more binding, whether through sheer custom or through new law.
>
> As supranational governance greases transborder commerce, more questions arise. If each nation has different food-testing and food-labeling laws, won’t that make life more complicated and expensive for pan-European food producers, and indeed for their customers? Moreover, if each nation has separate food laws, mightn’t they morph into covert trade barriers? Mightn’t French farmers support laws that deem Portuguese food processing substandard, or that define “cheese” so stringently as to keep some imports from carrying that label? All told, then, wouldn’t uniform food laws make things cheaper and simpler for most people? Yes, says the EU (game number four) and thus acquires another function. (And yes, said the United States early in the twentieth century; it was growing interstate commerce that carried such regulatory functions from the state to the federal level.)
>
> As Europe has already shown, the chain of non-zero-sum games needn’t end with regulatory and judicial power. With transnational commerce growing, all those national currencies became a bother. There was the cost of currency exchange and nagging uncertainty about exchange rates. Wouldn’t most Europeans benefit from a single currency? Yes, the EU decided. But one currency meant one central bank. So each nation lost its autonomous central bank and, at a more symbolic level, its currency (or, as they aptly say in Britain, its sovereign). At this point—with nations having surrendered their control of monetary policy—the line between a loose association of nations and an outright confederacy has arguably been crossed.
>
> ...
>
> All in all, the moral of the EU story is: Presto! International trade, via self-regenerating non-zero-sumness, can expand the scope of governance. No extraterrestrials necessary! As technology continues to shorten economic distance, the logical scope of supranational governance could conceivably become the whole planet. This may be hard to imagine now, given the cultural and linguistic diversity of the world and the simmering hostility among some of its peoples. But remember: If ninety, even sixty, years ago, you had predicted that someday France and Germany would have the same currency, the reply would have been: “Oh, really? Which nation will have conquered which?”" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "As it happens, the end of the second millennium has brought the rough equivalent of hostile extraterrestrials—not a single impending assault, but lots of new threats that, together, add up to a big planetary security problem. They range from terrorists (with their menu of increasingly spooky weapons) to a new breed of transnational criminals (many of whom will commit their crimes in that inherently transnational realm, cyberspace) to environmental problems (global warming, ozone depletion, and lots of merely regional but still supranational issues) to health problems (epidemics that exploit modern thoroughfares). None of these things has quite the galvanizing effect of space invaders, but they are all scary, and they all imply supranational governance in one sense or another. They threaten many nations with common perils that are best overcome through cooperation.
>
> The timing is convenient. With economic organization reaching the global level, and governance showing faint signs of doing the same, that great historical congealer of governance—an external enemy—disappears by definition. Meanwhile, a whole slew of nonzero-sum problems arise that are rather like an external enemy; they push people together, to escape common calamity, rather than pulling them together for common gain.
>
> You can already see some of the new structures of governance emerging. They are tenuous, but in their very weakness future strength is visible. Consider the Chemical Weapons Convention. The CWC gives an international body unprecedented power to spring surprise searches on any member state at the behest of any other member state. In 1997, when the U.S. Senate debated the treaty before ratifying it, critics warned about a loss of American sovereignty. In reply, defenders of the convention found themselves in the odd position of stressing its underlying weakness: if the inspectorate tries to search your garage, the American government can stall, and if the search seems unconstitutional, can thwart it. Presumably true. Still, if other countries can do the same, then much of the CWC’s value to the U.S.—the ability to demand inspections in foreign countries—goes down the drain. And if the U.S. wants to realize that value—if it wants other nations to surrender a bit more sovereignty—then it will have to surrender a bit more sovereignty. That’s the way these games work.
>
> The question, then, is whether the value of a stronger inspectorate will ever warrant the price of lost sovereignty. And the answer is almost certainly yes. The spread of technological information—including how to make weapons—has always been unstoppable in the long run, and new media, notably the Internet, are making the long run very short.
>
> Actually, chemical weapons are the least of the problem. On the Richter scale of weapons of mass destruction, they barely register. It is biological and nuclear weapons that ensure that by 2020 any well-funded terrorist group will have the know-how to kill 50,000 people in any given city.
>
> Biological weapons are much easier to make and to hide than nuclear weapons. The encroachment on sovereignty that they will call for is, to current sensibilities, shocking. All kinds of industrial and medical facilities will have to be monitored. The personal possession of some equipment will probably have to be banned, and surprise inspections will be necessary. This prospect—that some supranational agency could demand to search your basement or your kitchen freezer—would now strike most Americans as unthinkable, even if local police were in tow to guard against abuse.
>
> But trauma has a way of making the unthinkable widely thought. In the middle of World War II, the historian Arnold Toynbee met with a number of notables in Princeton, New Jersey, to discuss the postwar world. By the end of the meeting, Toynbee had convinced John Foster Dulles—a temperamentally conservative man who would later become secretary of state in a Republican administration—that world government was essential. Dulles signed on to the group’s conclusion that “as Christians we must proclaim the moral consequences of the factual interdependence to which the world has come. The world has become a community, and its constituent members no longer have the moral right to exercise ‘sovereignty’ or ‘independence’ which is now no more than a legal right to act without regard to the harm which is done to others.”
>
> ...
>
> Lots of non-zero-sum problems show the same logic: basic technological trends make their growth all but certain, and their eventual solution will likely entail real accretions of supranational governance. Global laws on the prescription of antibiotics? Sure, if their too-casual use creates strains of super-bacteria that can cross oceans on any airplane. Limits on each nation’s saltwater fish harvest, complete with random inspections of any fishing boat and stiff penalties? Sure, as the oceans thin out. An International Monetary Fund whose regulatory powers approach those that national governments now possess? Quite possibly, in the wake of a global depression.
>
> And then, of course, there is that notorious sovereignty-sapper, cyberspace, which empowers offshore tax evaders, offshore info-terrorists, offshore copyright violators, offshore libelers. (And sometimes the culprit may be on-shore, using an offshore computer.) Nations will find it harder and harder to enforce more and more laws unless they coordinate law enforcement and, in some cases, the laws themselves.
>
> Viewed separately, the various layers of supranational governance may not seem momentous. But they add up. We can’t predict for sure which problems will find strong supranational solution, but a broader prediction is possible: as technological evolution keeps doing what it has always done—expand and deepen non-zero-sumness—much supranational governance will be in order.
>
> In the end, then, the “chaos” and “order” scenarios find a kind of reconciliation. Whole new species of chaos will indeed arise, but they will drive the world to a new level of political organization that, if it works, will bring order. What the “chaos” theorists fail to see is that chaos is just a non-zero-sum problem, something people are good at solving." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Will the World Trade Organization ever go the way of the European Union? Will qualifying for membership someday entail more than low tariffs? Child-labor laws? Workplace-safety laws? Right-to-organize laws? And what about environmental law? Might adherence to global environmental treaties become part of staying a member in good standing of the WTO?
>
> None of this is unthinkable, especially if the American left—and the left in other nations—make such changes a condition for accepting WTO amendments that big business supports. We may well someday see workers of the world truly uniting, like environmentalists of the world. The old political debates will continue—How to balance economic equality with efficiency?—but they will be mediated by supranational bodies of governance, whether regional or global.
>
> ...
>
> Note the pattern: Again and again, supranational “tribes”—environmental groups, labor groups, human rights groups, trade groups, multinational corporations—abet order, not chaos. Their narrow but long reach moves law and regulation toward global harmony. These different tribes don’t stand in paradoxical contrast to globalization, any more than myriad kinds of cells stand in paradoxical contrast to the larger organism they constitute. In both cases, the fine-grained diversity is integral. The body politic couldn’t reach the global level if interest groups didn’t get there. To say that social complexity grows in depth and scope is to say that division of labor, including division of political labor, grows more fine-grained yet of broader reach. In that sense, supranational “tribalism” is a natural outgrowth of the whole history of humankind." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "This new support for supranational rules was based largely on growing economic interdependence, which made war more and more a lose-lose game. Indeed, war was not just a lose-lose game, but a lose-lose-lose game—bad for the warriors, but also, increasingly, bad for their neighbors. Kant had seen this logic beginning to unfold back in the late eighteenth century, and had extrapolated from it ambitiously: “The effects which an upheaval in any state produces upon all the others in our continent, where all are so closely linked by trade, are so perceptible that these other states are forced by their own insecurity to offer themselves as arbiters, albeit without legal authority, so that they indirectly prepare the way for a great political body of the future, without precedent in the past.”" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "“Great political body” number three—the United Nations—is the most ambitious one yet. God knows it hasn’t done quite the job of preserving peace that idealists envisioned. But it has had more glimmers of success than the League of Nations, and has already lived twice as long as the league.
>
> Moreover, expanding non-zero-sumness has in the meanwhile carried the rationale for supranational governance well beyond peacekeeping. Everything from tax policy to accounting standards to environmental policy to policing power is creeping toward the supranational level.
>
> Whether the eventual result will be a single “world government,” as woolly-minded one-worlders have long dreamed, is anybody’s guess. Another possibility, and perhaps a more benign one, is lots of overlapping bodies—some regional, some global; some economic, some environmental; some comprising national governments, some comprising non-state actors; and so on. An intermediate possibility is that these sorts of bodies would fall loosely under the auspices of the United Nations (as many inchoate bodies now do).
>
> All kinds of scenarios are imaginable. What is hard to imagine is that this migration of governance beyond national bounds will stop before turning nation-states into something rather like provinces. The migration is driven by clear technological trends that are millennia-old and show no signs of abating: advances in technology—information, transportation, military, and so on—that make relations among polities more non-zero-sum. This logic will draw “tribes” into the New World Order even as they fiercely assert their independence from an old order." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "In many developed nations, the drift toward world governance is drawing fire. The nation-state, nationalists complain, is sacrificing its sovereignty. This is true; governmental structures—including supranational ones—always lessen the freedom of their constituents. But at the same time, governmental structures expand freedom. If a city’s government is functioning well, its citizens gain the freedom to walk the streets with little fear of assault. Part of the deal, though, is that they don’t have the freedom to assault other citizens. If you like the idea of government, that means you cherish freedom from assault more than freedom to assault.
>
> So it is with supranational governance. Would you like to be reasonably free of the fear of a global depression? Or would you rather preserve your nation’s freedom to raise tariffs at will, or to keep its financial institutions opaque to international view? Do you cherish the freedom to live without fear of dying in a biological weapons attack? Or do you prefer the freedom to live without fear of having your freezer searched for anthrax by an international inspectorate in the unlikely event that evidence casts suspicion in your direction?
>
> Or, to turn such questions inside out: Which sort of sovereignty would you rather lose? Sovereignty over your freezer, or sovereignty over your life?
>
> The loss of sovereignty isn’t some novelty dreamed up by bureaucrats at the UN or the WTO. If we define sovereignty broadly—as supreme control over your fate—then the loss of sovereignty is a fact of history, one of the most fundamental, stubborn facts in all of history. Indeed, to observe that history has eroded sovereignty time and again is simply to restate the thesis of this book: that history has elevated non-zero-sumness time and again. For to say that you have been cast into a non-zero-sum situation is to say that you have lost unilateral control over your future—that your destiny has to some extent been taken out of your hands and spread among other people, just as part of their destiny now rests in your hands. Both you and they can regain some measure of that control, some portion of that lost sovereignty, but only through cooperation—a cooperation that involves sacrifices of control, of sovereignty, in its own right. The question is never whether you can keep all of your sovereignty; history says you can’t; all along it has been the fate of humankind to have its fate increasingly shared. The question is in what form you want to lose your sovereignty." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The early-twentieth-century sociologist William Ogburn attributed many of the world’s problems to “cultural lag.” Cultural lag happens when material culture (technology, basically) changes so fast that nonmaterial culture (including governance and social norms) has trouble catching up. In short, the disruptive part of culture gets out ahead of what Ogburn called the “adaptive” part of culture. Ogburn’s general prescription was to speed up the latter—“make the cultural adjustments as quickly as possible.” But there is another option: slow down the former—cut the rate at which material technology is transforming the world; make the inevitable unfold at a more sedate pace.
>
> Of course, it isn’t that easy. Globalization doesn’t come with a velocity-control knob. And the old-fashioned approach to slowing the spread of material technology—raising tariffs—has a history of inviting retaliation and thus yielding full-blown trade wars (the kind that usher in depressions). But there is a safer approach to slowing globalization down just a tad—a supranational approach.
>
> The idea isn’t to create a Bureau of Global Slowdown at the United Nations. The idea is simply to tolerate various supranational efforts that are starting to take shape and that, as they solidify, will naturally have a sedative effect. As first-world and third-world workers unite to raise third-world wages (and thus keep first-world wages from free-falling), industrialists will complain that this dulls the market’s edge, slowing progress. Yes, it does—but that’s okay. As environmentalists unite to save rain forests, or tax fossil fuels, the same complaint will be heard—and the same answer will apply. In the age of the superempowered angry man, and the quite disgruntled man, the slowing down of deeply unsettling change is a benefit, not just a cost, because anger and disgruntlement are world-class problems.
>
> Note that these two particular forms of slowdown—supranational labor and environmental policies—have the added virtue of directly addressing specific sources of anger and disgruntlement: the rapid exodus of blue-collar jobs from developed nations; and the ecological damage that can radicalize environmentalists and that, more broadly, deepens cultural dislocation in such already polluted places as Mexico City and Bangkok. In a sense, then, these policies address both halves of the “cultural lag.” Rather than choose between slowing the “material” change and hastening the “adaptive” change, we can slow the material change by hastening the adaptive change.
>
> In a way, it’s a misnomer to call this a “slowing” of globalization. After all, the things that might do the slowing—supranational labor groups or environmental groups, supranational bodies of governance—are themselves part of globalization. What is really happening is that the further evolution of political globalization is slightly slowing the evolution of economic globalization.
>
> This approach has a proven track record. In the United States during the early twentieth century, as economic activity migrated from the state level to the national level, the national government grew powerful enough to regulate it. And some of the regulation—labor laws in particular—had the effect of subduing capitalism a bit, dulling its harsher edges. This was, among other things, a preemptive strike against chaos (in the form of Marxist revolution) and a successful one.
>
> We needn’t worry much about economic globalization grinding to a halt under the weight of regulation. The political prerequisites for real regulation, such as strong transnational labor coalitions, will form only slowly, and the economic impetus behind globalization is mammoth. In fact, the only thing with much chance of stalling globalization for any length of time is the very chaotic backlash—from the angry and the disgruntled—that a slight slowdown might avert. Strange as it sounds, the best way to keep economic globalization from slowing down a lot may be to slow it down a little." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Hence a creepy irony of the coming world: even though information technology’s basic drift in recent centuries has been to expand freedom—to bring political pluralism to more and more nations—it can, at another level, shrink freedom. As the world comes to resemble a giant superorganism, with a fiber-optic nervous system, we could come to identify with Winston Smith, who, in Orwell’s 1984, is asked by a totalitarian goon: “Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell?” But, unlike Smith, we’ll have chosen the life of a cell.

After all, one way to soften the terms of this trade-off—to get more order without giving up liberty—is to reduce the number of people who want to disrupt the order: shrink the supply of angry men." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "As usual, Teilhard’s optimism is so fuzzy and boundless as to erode his credibility. And, as usual, his instinct for big-picture dynamics is acute enough to restore some credibility. He seems to sense that, when you face the trade-off between freedom and order, much of your wiggle room comes from a third variable that lies in the realm of spirit—or, to put it more mundanely, the realm of morality; what the world needs is to expand its supply of good will." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "How can I justify turning my back on the very things that got us where we are today—such spurs to progress as greed and hatred?
>
> Well, at the risk of sounding cold-hearted: they’ve outlived their usefulness. From the beginning their value was of an ironic sort. Enmity drove society toward larger expanses of amity. Greed and the lust for status, for power over people, helped drive a technological evolution that granted people more freedom. All along, the darker side of human nature was defensible, if at all, only to the extent that it tended to thus negate its own values system. And, all along, there was the implied prospect that, in the end, if the darker side’s downside grew and its upside waned, defending it would get hard.
>
> The end is here. With the world’s ecosystem already under stress, and billions of additional people apparently on the way, mindless materialism grows more dubious. With society finally globalized, we don’t need war to push political organization (that is, the realm of peace) to broader expanse. And with nuclear and biological weapons at hand, full-fledged war—and for that matter full-fledged terrorism—are less palatable than ever. Hatred just isn’t what it used to be.
>
> Even Herbert Spencer—who had a certain respect for enmity’s fructifying effects—saw the declining virtue of antipathy. He wrote: “From war has been gained all that it had to give….” The social evolution that “had to be achieved through the conflicts of societies with one another, has already been achieved; and no further benefits are to be looked for.” Wars, he observed, had not only ceased to be vital to progress; increasingly, they were the cause of “retrogression.” (And this was before nuclear weapons.)
>
> War has contained the seeds of its own demise all along. This primal form of zero-sum energy, through the very logic of history that it helped impel, was bound to grow more and more negative-sum until finally its downside was too glaring to ignore. In retrospect, it looks almost like planned obsolescence." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "God knows greed won’t vanish. Neither will hatred or chauvinism. Human nature is a stubborn thing. But it isn’t beyond control. Even if our core impulses can’t be banished, they can be tempered and redirected.
>
> Or, more accurately: some impulses can be used against others. People will always seek social status, and revel in the esteem of their peers, but this very thirst can be used to dampen other thirsts. In defining the kinds of behaviors that do and don’t win esteem, communities have great power over how human nature expresses itself. Among the things that can in principle become prerequisites for social status (and, indeed, in some communities already are): not engaging in conspicuous consumption; not saying hateful things about whole national, ethnic, or religious groups, or even about other people.

> "There is one further analogy between organisms and societies. It isn’t just that in both cases energy is marshaled in a way that sustains and protects structure. And it isn’t just that this marshaling is always guided by information. It is that it is the function of the information to guide the marshaling. The inter-cellular and intra-cellular messenger systems involved in fingernail or bone construction evolved to guide such construction; they were preserved by natural selection because they helped preserve the core of life’s structure, the DNA. And the same is true of the information-processing system that governs the construction of huts and temples and skyscrapers, and the maintenance of corporations and armies.
>
> I don’t mean that people are genetically endowed with cerebral programs for building temples and running armies. I mean that, more generally, people are genetically endowed with the proclivity to think about building things and orchestrating social enterprises, and to communicate about these projects; and that these genetically based data-processing proclivities were favored by natural selection because they helped sustain DNA, helped keep people alive. Cultural information, like all previous forms of organic information, was created to preserve and protect genetic information.
>
> Viewed against the backdrop of all of life, then, culture was in one sense nothing new: just another data-processing system invented by natural selection to marshal energy and matter in ways that preserve DNA. But it was the first of these systems that began to take on a life of its own, inaugurating a whole new kind of evolution. Natural selection, after inventing brainier and brainier forms of DNA, long ago invented brains—and then finally, in our species, invented a particularly impressive brain, a brain that could sponsor a whole new kind of natural selection." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "We can apply game theory to biological evolution. When two organic entities can enhance each other’s prospects for survival and reproduction, they face a non-zero-sum situation; to the extent that their interests are at odds, the dynamic is zero-sum. In this light we will see that biological evolution, like cultural evolution, can be viewed as the ongoing elaboration of nonzero-sum dynamics. From alpha to omega, from the first primordial chromosome on up to the first human beings, natural selection has smiled on the expansion of non-zero-sumness." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "To say that more and more complex organisms have evolved over time—as they have—is to say that genes have over time gotten involved in more vast and elaborate non-zero-sum interactions. From bacteria to people, biological evolution moved in fundamentally the same direction that cultural evolution has moved in.
>
> Is the story of life really so simple? Just more and more non-zero-sumness piling up? No. For one thing, there are a few fairly daunting evolutionary thresholds that had to get crossed somewhere between a well-designed bacterium and Homo sapiens. But, conveniently, crossing these thresholds tends to depend on harnessing non-zero-sum logic, a task at which natural selection manifestly excels." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The underlying reason that non-zero-sum games wind up being played well is the same in biological evolution as in cultural evolution. Whether you are a bunch of genes or a bunch of memes, if you’re all in the same boat you’ll tend to perish unless you are conducive to productive coordination. For genes, the boat tends to be a cell or a multicelled organism or occasionally, as we’ll see shortly, a looser grouping, such as a family; for memes, the boat is often a larger social group—a village, a chiefdom, a state, a religious denomination, Boy Scouts of America, whatever. Genetic evolution thus tends to create smoothly integrated organisms, and cultural evolution tends to create smoothly integrated groups of organisms." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Biological evolution, like cultural evolution, creates opportunities for cheaters—pirates and scoundrels who would parasitically subvert the greater good if left to their own devices. So natural selection designs technologies of “trust”—anti-cheating mechanisms.
>
> For example, we’ve seen that the cells in your body get along famously in large part because they are genetically identical. But suppose that, while your cells are dividing after birth, a mutation happens. A new, genetically distinct type of cell is born. Rather than focus on serving the needs of the larger organism, it replicates itself manically. By the time you are old enough to reproduce, there are so many of these mutant cells that they stand a much better than average chance of getting their DNA into the next generation.
>
> In theory, such a cell would be favored by natural selection—at least, in the short run. But in real life, this sort of parasitism couldn’t happen. The reason is that back when you were very, very, very young, your “germ line” was “sequestered.” That is, the cells that will form your egg or sperm were put aside for safekeeping; try as some mutant skin cell might, it will never get into the next generation, no matter how prolific it is.
>
> Why do animals thus seclude their germ lines? In the view of some biologists, it is precisely to avoid this sort of parasitic mutiny; germ-line sequestration is an anti-cheating device—the functional equivalent of a technology of trust. It presumably evolved as organisms that lacked such a technology died out, their coherence compromised by rampant cheating—rather as human cultures are extinguished if they fail to discourage the sorts of parasitism to which humans are prone." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The same thing happens in other species: chimpanzees, dolphins, even people. As noted in chapter 2, people, though smart enough to pursue non-zero-sum gain without specific prompting from their genes, do in fact get prompted. Generosity, gratitude, and outrage over ingratitude are genetically based impulses that can steer us into mutually profitable relationships and away from unprofitable ones. There is also a genetically based impulse that sometimes keeps us in profitable relationships—affection, an affection that, in the deepest friendships, can approach outright love. If kin selection can be credited with inventing affection, reciprocal altruism gets credit for extending affection beyond kin. And what gets credit for both feats is non-zero-sumness, the logic shared by these two evolutionary dynamics. Non-zero-sumness, in addition to being the reason that organic complexity exists, and the reason communication got invented, is the reason there is love." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "In biological evolution, as in cultural evolution, Kant’s “unsocial sociability” is a recurring theme. Indeed, “unsociality”—that’s a polite way of putting it, actually—is central to natural selection: organisms vie for finite resources, and the losers slip from the pages of history. And the “slipping” assumes such forms as starvation, disease, and getting devoured. Natural selection creates by discarding, and it doesn’t discard gently." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Did basic properties of natural selection make it very likely that someday some animal would be smart enough to invent neat gadgets? And figure out that the earth revolves around the sun? And ponder the mind-body problem? Does biological evolution intrinsically favor the growth of biological complexity—including behavioral flexibility, and its underpinning, intelligence? Is this biological “progress” somehow natural?
>
> It has long been unfashionable to answer yes. One big reason is the same big reason that made belief in directional cultural evolution so unfashionable: past political misuse.
>
> Early this century, biological progressivism was dear to the hearts of “social Darwinists,” who used it to justify things like racism, imperialism, and laissez-faire indifference to poverty. The logic behind social Darwinism—to the extent that it had a coherent logic—was something like the following: The suffering, even death, of the weak at the hands of the strong is an example of “survival of the fittest.” And the “survival of the fittest” has God’s blessing. And how do we know that the “survival of the fittest” has God’s blessing? Because He built the dynamic into His great creative process, natural selection. And how do we know that natural selection is God’s handiwork? Because of its inexorable tendency to create organisms as majestic as ourselves, organisms worthy of admission to heaven! In short, biological progressivism was used to deify nature in all its aspects, and nature, thus deified, was invoked in support of oppression.

> "Gould writes: “The vaunted progress of life is really random motion away from simple beginnings, not directed impetus toward inherently advantageous complexity.”
>
> Again, as with Gould’s emphasis on stagnant “modal” complexity, one might ask how much this argument really matters for philosophical purposes. The question behind this whole exercise, remember, is whether the evolution of something as smart and complex as us was very likely. If the combination of a “random walk” and a “wall of zero complexity” leads people to conclude that the answer is yes, then, well, their answer is yes. If, as Gould fears, people are inclined to take a “yes” answer as evidence of higher purpose, they probably aren’t going to be too picky about the exact type of “yes.” God, they will say, works in strange and wondrous ways.
>
> Still, the more factors favoring the evolution of complexity, the more irresistible the “yes” answer is—the more likely evolution was to eventually reach a human level of intelligence. So it’s worth seeing if Gould is somehow overlooking “non-random” factors that are conducive to complexity. He is. They fall under the rubric of “positive feedback”—the evolution of complexity strengthens the logic behind the evolution of complexity, which strengthens the logic behind the evolution of complexity … and so on." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

After all, presumably that kind of God wouldn’t have let Pol Pot happen—and wouldn’t allow the various other forms of cruelty and suffering in the world (including those inherent in organic evolution, and thus in our creation). This is not, of course, some new insight that emerges from this book’s vantage point. It is a very old insight—“the problem of evil”—that emerges from the most casual inspection of the everyday world: Why would a benign, almighty God let bad things happen to good people—or to people in general?
>
> Some thinkers have solved the problem of evil straightforwardly, by denying its premise. Ancient Zoroastrians said God is not omnipotent, but rather is in pitched battle with an evil spirit, and is doing His best. More often, theologians have finessed the issue: God is good and omnipotent, so all the seemingly bad things He tolerates must have redeeming qualities that make them ultimately good. For example, maybe suffering is a prerequisite for “soul building.”
>
> This argument has often drawn the obvious rejoinder: If God is omnipotent, why doesn’t He rewire the universe so that suffering isn’t necessary for “soul building”? What would be wrong with prefab souls?
>
> Personally, I prefer the Zoroastrian scenario. Or, perhaps, a scenario in which a good God, though not confronting an active, satanic force, is in some other sense of limited power.

> "My point is just that these brains are a continuous outgrowth of something at life’s very essence: a primordial imperative to process information. Given the apparent connection among information processing, sentience, and meaning, it seems fair to say that evolution by natural selection was from the beginning a veritable machine for making meaning.
>
> As we’ve seen, the logic by which complexity, hence data processing, hence meaning, grows is the logic of non-zero-sumness. The genes along a strand of DNA have a non-zero-sum relationship with one another, as do the organelles within a cell, the cells within a body. In all of these cases, the cause of the non-zero-sumness is shared Darwinian interest—being in the same boat in one sense or another—and the result is transmitted information. For, as noted in chapter 8, the successful playing of non-zero-sum games—cooperative coordination—generally involves communication.
>
> Within any organism, it is these well-played non-zero-sum games, and the flexible coherence they bring, that let life persist in the face of mounting universal entropy; that let life defy the spirit, though not the letter, of the second law of thermodynamics. That games which call for information processing should be on the leading edge of this war against entropy makes perfect sense. As Jacques Monod observed (in chapter 17), to arrange matter into an orderly form and keep it there, in the face of the second law’s tendency to mix things up, requires a “discriminative,” even “cognitive” capacity. Ever since life’s initial defiance of the spirit of the second law, information processing has risen to higher and higher levels, following the logic of organic coherence, which is to say, the logic of non-zero-sumness." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "On the other hand, isn’t goodness a slightly naive thing to ask of an architect whose plans included natural selection? At its core, natural selection is cutthroat. It is a zero-sum struggle for finite resources, and there are no rules. How much good could come of that?
>
> More than you might think. As we’ve seen, this dynamic had the paradoxical effect of weaving ever-larger non-zero-sum webs, from a single strand of DNA all the way up to a society of multicellular animals. The point isn’t just the attendant growth in data processing, hence sentience, hence meaning. Eventually, this dynamic brought some semblance of actual good. For, when the impetus of non-zero-sumness finally reached the level of animal societies, it entailed—as we saw in chapter 18—the invention and proliferation of love.
>
> Actually, “entailed” is a bit strong. What this impetus clearly entailed wasn’t love per se, but the evolution of altruistic behavior among close kin. This altruistic behavior in turn seems to have en-tailed—for reasons concealed in the more general mystery of consciousness—the subjective experience of love. (At least, in our species, love is what parents feel when they nurture and protect their offspring, and there’s no reason to think chimps or dogs are any different.) Anyway, the main point is that with the advent of altruism, animals were doing something other than eat each other; they were helping each other, and feeling good about it to boot.
>
> Intra-family altruism has evolved multiple times, and naturally so. With closely related organisms tending to start out life near each other, commonality of Darwinian interest is thick, just waiting to be harnessed by the logic of kin selection. Though maternal devotion was presumably the original form of kin-directed love (even many insects display maternal altruism), other forms followed: sibling love and—in our species and some others—paternal love.
>
> Altruism, having established a beachhead within the family, eventually branched out beyond close relatives. As we’ve seen, in a number of species, including ours, natural selection invented reciprocal altruism, which, notwithstanding its underlying cold calculation, involves heartfelt obligation, even affection. This tendency of human beings to form bonds beyond the family would become crucial as cultural evolution began the long geographic expansion of non-zero-sumness. Biological evolution, having created goodness by inventing altruism, would now surrender center stage to the second great evolutionary force, with which any hopes for expanding goodness would now lie.
>
> But before we get too rhapsodic about all this bonding, a word is in order about affection’s oft-underplayed downside. Ever hear of the “Texas cheerleader mom”? She was convicted of plotting to murder her daughter’s rival for a high-school cheerleading slot. The good news is that this woman is manifestly not typical of mothers in Texas—or anywhere. The bad news is that she nonetheless illustrates, if in grotesque proportion, a ubiquitous point: love is, by design, an invidious emotion. The problem isn’t just that love gets extended selectively, often coming to a screeching halt at the bounds of family. The problem is that love is often deployed to the active detriment of people beyond the family. It’s a jungle out there, after all, and we want our loved ones to triumph.
>
> This seamy underside of affinity isn’t confined to intra-family affinity. One common purpose of reciprocal altruism in primates is to cement coalitions which then compete with other coalitions, sometimes violently. In general, as the biologist Richard Alexander has observed, the flip side of “within-group amity” is “between-group enmity.”
>
> This dour equation seems almost to have been a constant of human history. Lengthened and strengthened bonds have tended to involve deepened fissures. Consider those nostalgic reveries about wartime. Soldiers talk about the indelible devotion to their comrades in arms, and civilians recall the sense of brotherhood that suffused a whole nation. Sounds great. But as amity thus reached national scope, the petty enmities of daily life weren’t so much erased as displaced—piled up, sky-high, along the nation’s border: a mass of hatred between peoples. It almost seems as if one of the basic laws of the universe, right next to “conservation of mass” and “conservation of energy,” is “conservation of antipathy.”
>
> Here again we encounter the problem of evil: you wouldn’t expect a benign and omnipotent God to embed such a law in the universe. Yet the law—or, at least, the “law”—does seem fundamental. It is grounded in the basic paradox of creation: non-zero-sumness, wondrous though it is, was created by, and for, zero-sumness, and is thus naturally prone to malicious use. Kant’s “unsocial sociability” lies in the very logic of natural selection." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Is “conservation of antipathy” truly a law of nature—or, at least, a rough tendency so deeply embedded in human affairs as to doom moral progress?
>
> No, for two reasons. First, martial fervor is not the only source of social bonding. If I water my neighbor’s plants while he’s away, and he returns the favor, our mutual amity grows just a bit—without any necessary growth in my dislike of anyone else. And much of the growth of non-zero-sumness over the past few millennia has been of this sort—people being “pulled” together for common gain, not “pushed” together by a common enemy.
>
> One of the main pulling forces, of course, has been economic. Granted, commerce can be a cool affair, and often fails to expand the web of affection, but it does expand the web of tolerance. You don’t have to love your grocer, but you shouldn’t assault him. You don’t have to love the people who built your Toyota, but it’s unwise to bomb them—just as it’s unwise to bomb the people overseas who are buying the things you made.
>
> The second reason that the alleged “conservation of antipathy” doesn’t doom moral progress has to do not with these “pulling” forces of economics but with the “pushing” forces, under which people unite to thwart a common threat. Though war is the time-honored example of such a force, we saw in chapter 15 how things can change as social organization approaches the global level. At that point, barring extraterrestrial invasion, conquest isn’t the peril that brings people together. Rather, they cooperate to evade such things as terrorism, international crime, environmental calamity, and economic collapse. More than before, non-zero-sumness can thrive without zero-sumness as its ultimate source. To whatever rough extent “conservation of antipathy” has held as a general law of history, it seems to be in the process of being repealed.
>
> Of course, zero-sumness hasn’t vanished. Corporations compete with corporations, politicians compete with politicians, soccer teams compete with soccer teams. What’s more, some of the new sources of common peril—terrorists and international criminals—are playing emphatically zero-sum games: they have interests quite opposed to those of society at large, and will accordingly inspire their share of antipathy. Still, as non-zero-sumness has grown, finally reaching global extent, a particular kind of zero-sum dynamic has begun to weaken. And it is the most pernicious kind: bitter struggle between geographically separate groups, featuring blind hatred of whole peoples. The spatial dimension of zero-sumness, historically its most abhorrent dimension, has begun to fade. In this sense—a limited but far from trivial sense—we can say that non-zero-sumness is on the verge of having “won” in the end." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "One can well imagine, as the Internet nurtures more and more communities of interest, true friendships more and more crossing the most dangerous fault lines—boundaries of religion, of nationality, of ethnicity, of culture.
>
> The common interests that support these friendships needn’t be high in gravitas. They can range from stopping ozone depletion to preserving Gaelic folklore to stamp collecting to playing online chess. The main thing is that they be far-flung and cross-cutting. Maybe this is the most ambitious realistic hope for the future expansion of amity—a world in which just about everyone holds allegiance to enough different groups, with enough different kinds of people, so that plain old-fashioned bigotry would entail discomfiting cognitive dissonance. It isn’t that everyone will love everyone, but rather that everyone will like enough different kinds of people to make hating any given type problematic. Maybe Teilhard’s mistake was to always use “noosphere” in the singular, never in the plural. Maybe the world of tomorrow will be a collage of noospheres with enough overlap to vastly complicate the geography of hatred. It wouldn’t be Point Omega, but it would be progress." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "One might hope that moral progress will get a boost from the further evolution of the world’s spiritual traditions. Certainly, in the past, religious doctrine has offered an expanding spiritual basis for the technologically driven expansion of non-zero-sumness. The growth of Islam more than a millennium ago not only created a network of Muslim traders who could trust one another; by preaching tolerance of Christians and Jews—“people of the Book”—Islamic scripture smoothed the path of commerce all the more.
>
> Judeo-Christian doctrine was similarly pragmatic in its evolution. It is easy to miss the continuity here—to see an abrupt shift between the Old Testament, with its wrathful, tribalistic God, and the New Testament, with its universally loving God. Indeed, in early Christian times, some thinkers—such as Marcion, in the second century—used this dichotomy to solve the problem of evil: the God of the Old Testament, the creator of life, was an evil god, and the God of the New Testament, the God of love, had now come to help us make the best of a bad situation. But the truth is that even in the Old Testament, God can be seen turning into a nicer guy. In the millennium before Christ arrived, as commerce drew distant lands into deeper contact (thanks partly to the debut of coins), the scope of God’s sympathy grew. In two books composed in the second half of the millennium—Jonah and Ruth—God’s love reaches beyond tribal bounds, to gentiles." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "As the realm of non-zero-sumness has grown, material prosperity has entailed acknowledging the humanity of an ever-larger fraction of the human species. Jonah is on the cusp of the trend. In an increasingly interconnected land, he would do well to do right—to mute his anger toward whole groups of people he’s never met.
>
> In effect, as cultural evolution has progressed, the size of society writ large—the number of people with whom one’s fortunes are intertwined, with whom one does well to do right—has grown. And one role of religious doctrine has always been to congeal societies. (The word “religion” comes from the Latin ligare, “to bind.”) Émile Durkheim went so far as to say that “the idea of society is the soul of religion.” Depending on how it is put, the point can sound a little dispiriting—as when Durkheim wrote: “In the last analysis men have never worshipped anything other than their own society.” Still, if worshiping your own society finally, in a global age, involves not denigrating other peoples but, rather, recognizing the moral worth of human beings everywhere, then there is something to be said for worshiping your own society. The equation between doing well and doing right may sound crass, but if, over tens of millennia of cultural evolution, it brings moral enlightenment, then my hat is off to it." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Is it really possible that new, improved religions might help congeal the world? If so, what might their core doctrines be? Oh, the usual—universal brotherhood—except this time with feeling. Also, the admonitions against greed that are scriptural boilerplate could stand to get dusted off and read with an eye to (among other things) slowing the rate at which the planet becomes a giant cauldron of garbage dumps, melting ice caps, and Mercedes-Benz utility vehicles." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The point is that we are playing for the highest stakes in history. More souls are crammed onto this planet than ever, and there is the real prospect of commensurately great peril. At the same time, there is the prospect of building the infrastructure for a planetary first: enduring global concord.
>
> And if we did that—if we laid a foundation for peace and fulfillment around the world—that would counterbalance a lot of past evils, given the number of people now around to enjoy the benefits. It may literally be within the power of our species to swing nature’s moral scales—which for so long tended to equilibrate near dead even, at best—decisively in the direction of good; maybe it is up to us, having inherited only the most ambiguous evidence of divinity, to construct clearer evidence in the future. Maybe history is, as various thinkers have suggested, not so much the product of divinity as the realization of divinity—assuming our species is up to the challenge, that is. (One theologian has paraphrased Teilhard as believing that “God must become for us less Alpha than Omega.”)
>
> My belief that some workable infrastructure for concord will very likely emerge does nothing to drain the drama from the present, for one plausible route to long-run success is near-term catastrophe. However close to inevitable stable world governance may be in the long run, here and now we are playing for the highest stakes that have ever been played for, and winning will depend in no small part on continued moral growth. Which is to say: winning will depend on not wanting other peoples to lose." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "More than ever, there is the real chance of either good or evil actually prevailing on a global scale. War and other forms of mass slaughter, other manifestations of massive hatred, could be ended—or, on the other hand, they could set new records for death and destruction; they could even, conceivably, end us. And the outcome may hinge on the further spread of knowledge—not just empirical knowledge, but moral knowledge.
>
> Talk about a page turner! Maybe, in the end, this is the best argument for higher purpose: that the history of life on earth is too good a story not to have been written. But, whether or not you believe the story indeed has a cosmic author, one thing seems clear: it is our story. As its lead characters, we can’t escape its implications." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "If self-interested entities are to realize mutual profit in a non-zero-sum situation, two problems typically must be solved: communication and trust." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "A non-zero-sum relationship is not a relationship in which cooperation is necessarily taking place. It is (usually) a relationship in which, if cooperation did take place, it would benefit both parties. Whether the cooperation does take place—whether the parties realize positive sums—is another matter. And, aside from “non-zero-sum,” I can’t think of a word that captures this relationship. To call it a relationship in which “self-interest rationally pursued could lead to cooperation” just isn’t very economical. Even a relationship “conducive to cooperation” isn’t very economical, and is vague, even misleading, to boot.
>
> All of which brings us back to “non-zero-sumness.”
>
> Non-zero-sumness is a kind of potential. Like what physicists call “potential energy,” it can be tapped or not tapped, depending on how people behave. But there’s a difference. When you tap potential energy—when you, say, nudge a bowling ball off a cliff—you’ve reduced the amount of potential energy in the world. Non-zero-sumness, in contrast, is self-regenerating. To realize non-zero-sumness—to turn the potential into positive sums—often creates even more potential, more non-zero-sumness. That is the reason that the world once boasted only a handful of bacteria and today features IBM, Coca-Cola, and the United Nations." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "A key feature of cultural evolution has been to make it possible for such non-zero-sum games to get played over great distances, among a large number of players. And in these kinds of situations, typically, there does need to be explicit communication (however circuitous), and there do need to be explicit means of sustaining trust. Hence the importance of evolving information technology in expanding the scope and complexity of social organization. Hence, too, the importance of evolving “technologies of trust” (often, though not always, in the form of laws enforced by a government) in helping to realize the non-zero-sum potential that new information technologies (and other technologies) create." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Culture is not just something we passively experience, but also something we actively influence. The sociological categories themselves are thus, in a real way, up for re-conception and re-invention. Government, economics, education, and yes, even religion are social structures and systems whose parameters should not be taken as immutable givens but, within reason, and subject to constraints, be up for redesign. Jamie Wheal calls such work “culture architecture.” I tend to think of it as “civilizational design,” wherein culture-artists develop new ways of living and being for a world so urgently in need of new possibilities." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "While only 10 years ago it would have sounded utterly preposterous to be talking in terms of architecting new religions and co-creating worldviews, today these sorts of projects are at the cutting edge of systems change activism and civilizational design. More and more, people are realizing that to fix the unimaginably knotty problems our society faces requires intervention at levels never before imagined. Fortunately, as our problems become more profound, so does the leading edge of our thought, so that even as we grapple with the prospect of global civilizational breakdown and climatological catastrophe, we also have the conceptual tools to develop new spiritual frameworks and even whole worldviews that can meet these existential challenges head-on." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "So, what is Emergentism, exactly? Well, let’s start with the name. The concept of “emergence” and “emergent properties” has become crucial to the new science I have been referring to—nowadays known simply as “complexity science.” The basic idea is that, as things become more and more complex, completely novel and unpredictable phenomena arise—entirely new layers of reality, in fact, which behave according to their own laws and principles. These new levels are said to “emerge” out of interactions occurring lower down, and so possess their own unique “emergent properties” not reducible to their parts." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "According to the cosmology of the new science, consciousness itself is what has been breaking forth from its concealment in mere matter. The evolution of the cosmos has been unfolding so as to bring forth self-awareness and self-knowledge. The universe itself is waking up—including waking up to this very realization (through us). For we are that consciousness." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "A worldview with a broken sense of how parts relate to wholes can break our relationship to the whole world. And isn’t that precisely what has happened?
>
> Consider, for instance, that meaning itself is a whole-part relationship. For something to have meaning, it must be a means—that is, it must exist for something else, as a means to something else. It must have a causal significance, we would say, in something “bigger” than itself.
>
> ...
>
> If, then, our sense of the relationship between parts and wholes becomes corrupted, we are at risk of losing our very sense of meaning itself—just as, in fact, we have done. We have become parts without a whole, at the same time that we cannot even claim to be whole ourselves." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The world, we all know, is immensely complex. The word “complex” comes from Latin and means “woven together.” And that is indeed an apt metaphor, since all you have to do is look around you to see the countless varied phenomena endlessly interacting, intermingling, and interrelating in infinite combinations." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This is how we’ve come to use rationality to analyze the world. The word “analyze” means, literally, “to break apart.” By breaking the world into its parts and assessing each one in isolation, the early modern scientists hoped to gain an understanding of how the whole loaf of reality works.
>
> And, in countless crucial ways, they did! The astonishing triumph of modern science (as well as its limiting weakness, as we’ll see) lay in this: its isolation of the part from the whole." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Everything could—or would—be explained by simple material part-icles in motion: a metaphysical framework known as materialism.
>
> Thus, with the triumph of reductionism, the entire religious edifice of tradition cracked, its metaphysical Great Chain and cosmic story rapidly eroding. In its place was modernity’s new worldview—with its own metaphysics and unnerving new narrative.
>
> This metaphysical framework was valueless. The hierarchy of reality was not organized by good and evil, only size—and the smallest parts were the most important. There was no personal God, only deterministic laws that govern the universe—and these were as indifferent to humans’ existential lot as any machine. Whatever could not be described in terms of fundamental particles in motion was either a fiction or an illusion.
>
> The cosmic story of this worldview was, as a consequence, radically different from that of traditional religion. Having stripped a benevolent God of any causal power, there was no providential “creation” per se; the universe just was (and presumably always was; or, if it did have a beginning, arose from chance).
>
> There was no divine drama or omniscient Plan. Human beings, and all life, were essentially just complicated machines, governed not by their agency but by their constituent parts following deterministic paths through space. And just as there is no meaning to turning gears or pumps, neither is there any meaning, ultimately, to human life.
>
> In this way, it should be clear that reductionism was what first sowed the seeds of our contemporary meaning crisis. With the rise of modern reductionistic science, humanity’s role in a divine saga was lost, and the perceived whole of conscious human life itself was reduced to its smallest parts—where one no longer finds any meaning, only law.
>
> This idea continues to reverberate and resonate today. Millions of despairing souls still believe it—and it is driving them to the nihilistic conclusions nascent in it. Until, at last, here we are: We have become parts without a whole, at the same time that we cannot even claim to be whole ourselves.
>
> Our lives lack the larger context of a cosmic story in which we play an important causal role. Nor can we even claim to be genuine agents with volitional integrity, since our wills and even our conscious awareness itself are merely “epi-phenomenal” illusions: vestigial byproducts of particles acting in deterministic fashion deeper down." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "But things become more problematic with the second law, likewise deduced from observation, which says that the total energy in the system will gradually and irrevocably dissipate until a homogenous equilibrium state is reached. Differences even out, distinctions blur, and gradients are eradicated over time.
>
> Think what happens when you add hot water to a thermos of cold water. That energetic hot water won’t stay all clumped together in one place; instead, the heat will spread out (or “dissipate”) until all the water in the thermos finally becomes one uniform temperature. This is called “entropy,” and the second law asserts that free energy is always being entropically dissipated over time—degraded, you could say, until eventually it’s totally useless and the system reaches a uniform, featureless balance: equilibrium.
>
> This insight created a big problem for the conception of Newtonian reality as particles in motion whose future and past states could all be predicted with deterministic certitude. Instead of being able to deduce it, once something reaches equilibrium it’s impossible to know its earlier state (AKA its “initial conditions”). You can’t deduce from a warm thermos that there was ever hot water of a certain temperature added to cold water of a certain temperature; all of that information is lost once the temperatures mix due to entropy.
>
> The laws of Newtonian physics were completely reversible. Gravity might bring a rock down, but enough force against gravity could throw a rock right back up again. The laws of thermodynamics, by contrast, had a clear irreversible trajectory. The hot and cold water will mix spontaneously over time, but trying to separate them again requires a lot of energy—free energy that no longer exists in the system, precisely because it’s been dissipated.
>
> In short, according to Newton’s laws, time was negligible; according to the laws of thermodynamics, however, time has a clear direction. It gives us what Arthur Eddington famously called the “arrow of time.” And, according to the laws of thermodynamics, that arrow seemed to move only one way: from a gradient to equilibrium, from difference to sameness, from distinct order to jumbled chaos. According to the second law, entropy in a closed system can only increase, suggesting the universe itself must be like an engine irrevocably running out of fuel, destined for dissolution and death.
>
> At least, that was how its cosmic implications came to be interpreted by an increasingly modernized world. Primed to imagine life as a meaningless accident in an indifferent cosmos, this discovery fell comfortably in line with the grim reductionist worldview—even though it actually flew in the face of the scientific reductionism that had helped found that worldview (and would eventually help overthrow it entirely—something we’ll come back to)." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Reductionist science—along with nihilistic interpretations of thermodynamics and evolution—had fundamentally changed people’s perspective regarding the part that humans played in the cosmic whole, leading them to no longer see themselves as agential wholes but only deterministic meat-suits moving through space.
>
> As a consequence, people today who feel they know a thing or two (and likely find themselves in positions of power) can, as we said, confidently assert: Life’s just a cosmic accident; the fit survive by preying on the weak and stupid; morality’s a fairy tale invented to keep people in line; and, sooner or later, the sun will explode, the universe will end in heat death, and none of this dazzling sound and fury will have meant a goddamn thing—so why not live it up while we can? By the early 20th century, all of the ingredients for the meaning crisis were firmly in place.
>
> As it turns out, however, this nihilistic worldview is actually… well… just simply wrong. It is based on contradictions, incomplete science, and unjustified extrapolations—failures that the new science has since begun to correct, but which nevertheless still hold sway in the public imagination. Let’s unpack this and, in the process, introduce the new science of complexity.
>
> First of all, the classical reductionism of Newtonian physics was reversible; it didn’t matter in which direction you “ran the tape”—backwards or forwards—everything was just a matter of deterministic particles in motion.
>
> However, both thermodynamics and evolution were different. They presented a model of reality quite contrary to this idea, with laws that had a direction. Entropy demanded a distinct “arrow of time,” and descent with modification meant that life was growing more and more varied with time.
>
> Thus, despite being subsumed into the bleak modern worldview, these paradigms seemed to contradict some of its founding assumptions.
>
> But if this were true, and the universe was irreversibly unfolding in some particular direction, which direction was it? Thermodynamics and evolution glaringly contradicted one another on this crucial point. One suggested the world was losing its usable energy and winding down towards the simple uniformity and homogeneity of equilibrium; the other, that the world was becoming ever more differentiated and elaborately structured—even in a “progress towards perfection.”
>
> Well, which was it? Chaos or order? Inert sameness or dynamic novelty? What was the true ending to the cosmic story science was telling?
>
> The resolution of this conundrum would only come with the transcendence of the reductionist paradigm altogether—a process set in motion towards the end of the 19th century, and only fully realized quite recently." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Reductionism, and the worldview it gave rise to, are predicated on the idea that we can understand reality best by isolating parts from the whole. By first analyzing the components, thought the pioneers of modern science, we can then work our way up to an understanding of the totality—because, after all, isn’t the whole just a sum of its parts?
>
> Well, it just so happens: Nope, it’s not. It’s really, really not. We know now something that the early scientists didn’t (and couldn’t): that when it comes to the more complex realities of nature, it’s not just about the parts and how they work by themselves. It’s just as much—if not more—about how the parts relate to one another.
>
> Wholes are made not only of parts, but of the relations of those parts. How one part works in concert with another part, and that one with another, and all of them together—those are dynamics that matter as much as the stuff of the parts themselves. Wholes aren’t just things—they’re also processes." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Life had escaped understanding in terms of classical physics precisely because it was, contrary to the “isolated systems” studied in fields like thermodynamics, connected to and in direct relationship with its environment by flows of matter and energy.
>
> All of this would eventually lead to a truly revolutionary discovery—beginning a whole new field called non-equilibrium thermodynamics—which would contribute immensely to a radical re-conception of how energy behaves, and thus how life itself emerges and operates.
>
> ...
>
> But, Prigogine wondered, what if the system isn’t closed, but opened up to a flow of energy? That is, let’s say we’re not looking at water in a closed thermos anymore, but a pan of water over a lit stove. How does the system behave now?
>
> Simple as the idea was, the results were truly extraordinary. For, rather than spontaneously dissolving towards the disorder of equilibrium, the water in this scenario does the opposite: it spontaneously self-organizes, and structure emerges!
>
> Structures like this (called Bénard cells, after their original discoverer Henri Bénard) arise naturally, fueled by the energy flowing into the system. In fact—and here’s the amazing part—they arise precisely in order to dissipate that energy and generate the entropy demanded by the second law of thermodynamics! They emerge naturally because such configurations are simply more efficient at producing that entropy than more chaotic, disordered ones.
>
> A much more familiar example of such a dissipative structure (as Prigogine called them) is the whirlpool that appears in your bathtub when you pull the stopper. This highly ordered spiral gyre emerges naturally and spontaneously as the result of countless water molecules self-organizing. Why? Because such a configuration actually allows the water to drain faster.
>
> The natural tendency of the universe to seek balance and equilibrium can actually propel systems to become temporarily more ordered to achieve this end. That is, the same law that drives closed systems towards disorder and equilibrium actually drives open systems to generate order and complexity—and to remain “far from equilibrium,” in fact, as long as that flow of energy into the system persists.
>
> If this dynamic sounds familiar, it should. This is precisely the way that all living organisms operate, too! For life to accomplish all of the complex processes it must perform to resist entropy and stay highly ordered, it must be continually taking in new energy sources to metabolize.
>
> Or, in terms more familiar to us: If you don’t eat, you die. Life is always in relational exchange with its environment—a complex, open system, in which the second law operates to facilitate self-organization, keeping it far from equilibrium (i.e., death)." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Based on such discoveries, an additional law of thermodynamics has been proposed (first by Alfred Lotka and later by H. T. Odum) that includes the evolutionary implications of energy: “During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.”
>
> Energy self-organizes matter into life, and life self-organizes by maximizing energy. Or, as complexity scientist Harold Morowitz put it, “The energy that flows through a system acts to organize that system.”
>
> In this way, the dynamics of life became considerably clearer—not by looking at smaller and smaller parts (the way reductionism sought—and failed—to make sense of things), but by considering precisely the opposite: the relationship with the broader whole in which parts are embedded.
>
> More than that, a consideration of how the whole is changing can inform our understanding of the parts. In this case, the whole is the universe itself and the parts are everything in it. The fact that the universe as a whole is expanding means that the second law does not require that everything one day end in heat death. This assumption was likely far too hasty. The great complexity scientist Stuart Kauffman summarizes this point in reassuring terms in his 2016 book Humanity in a Creative Universe:
>
> 'The second law says free energy is running down. But we know now that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to the mysterious dark energy that comprises about 70 percent of the energy of the entire universe. The implications of this accelerating expansion is that we do not have to worry about enough free energy. As the universe becomes larger, its maximum entropy increases faster than the loss of free energy by the second law, so there is always more than enough free energy to do work.'
>
> The takeaway? The initial conclusions scientists had drawn from the laws of thermodynamics were wrong: the universe was not destined only to grow more and more disordered with time. That idea arose on the false assumption that isolated systems could tell us everything we needed to know about energy." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This self-organizing dynamic is a naturally cumulative, snowballing process that keeps building on itself—a process Prigogine called “order through fluctuation.” As energy pushes open systems farther from equilibrium, fluctuations in the energized system lead to threshold “bifurcation points,” at which the system is presented with novel, higher-order configurations as potential next stages of its evolution." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Evolution had suggested an increase in novelty, diversity, and complexity; now, thermodynamics agreed. More than that, it actually helped explain why and how complexification occurs, by linking the evolutionary process to free energy and emergent self-organization.
>
> In this way, evolutionary development was no longer something unique to life, but a process that could be expanded to include less complex matter, too. In his book Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature, Eric Chaisson writes:
>
> 'Life is an open, coherent, spacetime structure maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a flow of energy through it—a carbon-based system operating in a water-based medium, with higher forms metabolizing oxygen. Although the second part of this definition pertains to the living state as we know it, the first part could well apply to a galaxy, star, or planet… And that is the crux of our argument: Life likely differs from the rest of clumped matter only in degree, not in kind.'
>
> The degree to which it differs is one of complexity—for which Chaisson employs a specific metric, one that can be used to measure the complexity of anything from stars to living organisms: free energy rate density.
>
> As systems theorist Ervin László summarizes it in his pioneering book Evolution: The Grand Synthesis:
>
> 'Free-energy flux density is a measure of the free energy per unit of time per unit of mass: for example, erg/second/gram. A complex chemical system retains more of this factor than a monatomic gas; a living system retains more than a complex chemical system. This indicates a basic direction of evolution, an overarching sweep that, together with the decrease of entropy and of equilibrium, defines the arrow of time in the physical as well as in the biological and the social world.'
>
> Free energy flows through systems, organizing them into more orderly configurations. Order builds upon order, and complexity mounts—until whole new emergent levels appear, like life from matter. In this way, complexity is really just a measure of how energy organizes matter—something it has been doing to exponentially greater degrees as time passes." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "something else emerges: agency. Work by complexity researchers like Sara Walker, George Ellis, Giulio Tononi, Erik Hoel, and others has shed considerable light on the way more complex organisms come to exhibit causal power on their lower-level constituent parts. Such causal emergence repudiates the old deterministic account of organisms as being nothing but particles in motion. Rather, it shows that information generated at higher levels can have a causal effect on its material substrate. In this way, there is not only “bottom-up” causation from particles, but also “top-down” causation, as information encoded in patterns of organization at the macro-level works to direct material particles at the micro-level towards specific states and goals.
>
> Such causal emergence appears for the first time in earnest with the origin of life, as information in the genome is able to supervene over the molecular and atomic level, leveraging the parts towards the aims of the biological whole. This sort of agency gains entirely new levels of causal freedom and power, however, with the rise of more complex minded animals. In this way, the self-consciousness such as human beings exhibit can be understood as a uniquely complex form of causal emergence, whereby activity at the mental level exerts itself over and above the activity of the body. In this way, the will itself emerges. We are, then, not just determined automatons the way reductionists like Laplace envisioned, but genuinely free agents with self-determination, whose choices matter." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Unifying theories of complexity such as Azarian’s and Henriques’s bring together numerous strands of evidence into a clearly discernable big picture of reality. According to this picture, as the universe complexifies through a learning algorithm of experimentation and selective retention, it has hit upon new information processing mechanisms that have occasioned a few quantum leaps in knowledge accumulation. This increase in knowledge proceeds alongside increases in power (free energy rate density), configurational complexity, depth of sentience, and degree of intelligence." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Surprising as it may sound, self-consciousness required other selves to render it possible. The sense of self could not have emerged outside of society, because it is based on language and inter-subjective accounting. That is why self-consciousness is rightly understood as emerging not with Mind (which all animals possess), but with Culture. Only at the level of Culture has self-awareness and self-knowledge appeared in the universe." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Just as Life evolves by accretive modifications to DNA and Mind by accretive adjustments to experience, so Culture evolves by accretive conceptual development. Collective intelligence shapes meme networks—called “metamemes”—which individual self-conscious minds “download” to better navigate their environment. Such metamemes serve to justify, legitimate, and explain human behavior and natural phenomena in their unique contexts—making them effectively equivalent to what we have been calling worldviews.
>
> Because worldviews are evolving, they are also complexifying, generating more sophisticated wholes by incorporating more and more of the knowledge from previous justificatory worldviews. Like other evolving organisms, as they complexify, their energetic input and output likewise increases. As energy structures what it flows through, so human societies reconfigure into “more elaborate forms” over time.

> "The vision of God we have been considering is, I believe, beautiful and profound. It is, however, admittedly somewhat different from how many people tend to think of God. Isn’t God supposed to be “all-knowing” (omniscient), “all-powerful” (omnipotent), and “all-loving” (omni-benevolent)? The God of Emergentism would seem to be only becoming such things. Is this God-concept really worthy of the name, then? Doesn’t thinking of God like this create too many problems?
>
> As it happens, thinking of God like this resolves many of the problems that have plagued religious thinking for millennia—particularly the thorniest challenge of all: the problem of evil and suffering.
>
> If we are to maintain that God is truly omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, and always has been and always will be, then how do we explain the unspeakable amount of pain and suffering in the world? If God made everything just as it is, knowing it would include all the mass extinctions, tortures, famines, plagues, genocides, rapes and molestations that have occurred and continue to occur—even though he could have made it all differently—then we can only conclude that such a God is evil.
>
> Even if we counter (as theologians have across the millennia) that such things only occur because God gave humans free will, it still does not resolve the problem. Much of the suffering in the world is from natural disasters, the basic fact of mortality, and systemic oppression—forms of suffering outside the ken of individual free will. In any event, if God were truly all-powerful, God could create free will such that it never produced any suffering (a thought which might seem paradoxical to us, but only because we live in a world where free will exists as it does—the suffering-dependent free will that God inexplicably chose to create). In short, considering the nature of the world we live in, if there were a God responsible for it all, that God could be all-loving or all-powerful—but not both.
>
> The idea that God is supposed to be both is a paradox which, failing to be resolved according to any rational notion, can only be embraced by asserting faithful cliches like “God works in mysterious ways” or “God’s ways are not our ways.” But try telling this to the man who lost his wife and children in a house fire, or the girl chained up in a man’s basement for decades as a sex slave. If you do not feel the aching inadequacy of such a rationalizing response to these horrors, your desire for existential comfort through theological platitudes has clearly blinded you to your own humanity.
>
> Suffering is real. And would any God worth the name have knowingly chosen it, had such a God power to do otherwise? According to the theology of Emergentism, God didn’t, and couldn’t. The Universe may be headed towards infinite Love, Compassion, Knowledge and Power, but it started off as mere radiation, spent billions of years as bacteria, and only gradually worked its way up to beings with any degree of awareness, let alone self-consciousness and a moral compass.
>
> God is not conscious enough in the lion to understand or amend the suffering of the elk. Graciously, the elk is not conscious enough to fully contemplate its own suffering, which would render it truly excruciating. The degree of consciousness renders suffering more acute, but also more amenable to alleviation.
>
> Only at the level of self-consciousness do morality and ethics emerge. Only once the Universe has come, via will, and then concepts (including counterfactuals), to self-awareness, can it choose to diminish suffering. Only then is it capable of doing so, and only then is it responsible to do so.
>
> Tennyson asked, “Are God and Nature then at strife, / That Nature lends such evil dreams?” In a way, Yes. Nature is not yet God; God is the future’s infinitely perfected Nature. After the Big Bang, but before apotheosis, Nature lacks the omniscience and omnipotence we attribute to its telos, God. On the other hand, because Nature tends towards God, and is God fundamentally (albeit in embryonic form), God is no more at strife with Nature than an adult is at strife with herself as a child. But we do not hold the child to the same standards as the adult. The child is still undeveloped. Progress requires imperfection.
>
> Accepting this view of things, suffering does not refute God, but only one conception of God (namely, as unchanging, omniscient, and omnibenevolent). Allowing for the changingness of God, for God’s evolution, resolves the paradox of suffering and divinity.
>
> Moreover, seeing that it is through self-conscious agents like us that God becomes aware, we lose the illusion that God is some perfect figure acting upon us from above, subjecting us to suffering, allowing terrors to occur, and so on. Instead, it is through the eyes of the world that God sees. God is the man who lost his family; God is the tortured girl. God does not escape suffering. God suffers because humanity suffers. Suffering humanity is God—torturer and tortured, crucified and crucifier. God is always on the cross; God is always the soldier who nailed him to it, too.

> The degree to which God aims to reduce suffering is tied to the depth of consciousness that allows for the recognition of suffering and the capacity to take responsibility for its alleviation." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Much suffering is meaningless, the consequence of a world in which God is not yet, but on the way. Laboring towards its alleviation hastens the coming of God into the world. Suffering for the alleviation of suffering is sacrifice. At the same time, it is an aim for human endeavors, and thus the source of meaning. And toiling in the divine labor is the most meaningful effort of all." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The “arrow of time” is thus the natural flow of the Universe towards its telos. Like a river flowing downstream, existence flows toward God. Just as the spiraling gyre arises spontaneously to facilitate flow, so the Universe organically self-organizes towards its maximally complex form: Divinity.
>
> The theophany of God in time culminates in a hypothetical future point of maximal complexity, consciousness, goodness, and power. This is the optimistic eschatology (“ideas about the end”) of Emergentism.  Complexity, we have seen, deepens consciousness, and the deeper the consciousness, the deeper the ethical regard for the conditions of reality, as well as the means to ameliorate it." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Our collective sensemaking must be updated in such a way that we become more conscious of the emergent levels we are built upon—the parts to our whole.

Nor can a modern materialist grasp what all this postmodern “environmental hysteria” is about that’s limiting economic growth and individual liberty.

> "Complexity, as we noted, is only the outward manifestation of an inner deepening of consciousness. As structural complexity increases so does the inner richness of experience. When we consider the full breadth of the Mandala of Emergences in relation to its associated increase in depth, then, we can imagine the attractor of the Omega singularity (God consciousness) drawing all the Universe towards it, just as a cosmic singularity curves all of space-time towards itself.
>
> Indeed, much as Einstein appreciated that space and time are like a single fabric warped by mass, so might we symbolize objective complexity and subjective consciousness as one single fabric — complexity-consciousness — warped by something like free energy rate density towards greater and greater subjective depth." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This scientific revolution has allowed us to understand far more accurately aspects of what our religious forebears partially intuited, so that we can now re-integrate our findings into a comprehensive vision of the full richness of reality. When we do this, we are confronted with a truly remarkable vision. The cosmos is indeed organized according to a graded, hierarchical sequence. However, this sequence is arranged according to complexity. All its levels are made of the same basic stuff, and the scale unfolds through time, endlessly evolving and developing on its way towards an infinitely receding realization of perfection." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Religion is ultimately meaningless if it doesn’t affect how people live in the real world. It’s one thing to know, it’s another to do, and taking cosmic complexification seriously has a plethora of transformational implications for how we ought to be showing up in the world. Wisdom informs action. Hence the second meaning of religio: “observance,” as in “observing one’s duties/responsibilities”; the etymological opposite of the word “neglect.” Religion means living your beliefs." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Simply put, Emergentist spiritual practice is about conscious participation in the awakening of the Universe.

> "How might we amplify and assist the increase in order vs. chaos, vitality vs. decay, pleasure vs. pain, and Self-knowledge vs. ignorance? To develop a personal ecology of practices that succeeds in these endeavors would mean that we are consciously aiding the Universe in its own journey of awakening. We are the Self-consciousness of the Universe; our spiritual journey is God’s spiritual journey.

>
> From atoms to cells to moving bodies to symbolically-mediated self-consciousnesses, we have the Universe inside us. We must tend to all levels of the Wisdom Stack, then, if we are to be maximally integrated beings. And only as such integrated beings will we be ready and responsible to rise still further, through the next emergence on the horizon, towards our divine calling. For, ultimately, we must follow this trajectory to its true telos: an awakening to God consciousness, wherein we experience the true mystical union—subject with object, self with Self, that we might say “I AM,” knowing we are God, we are the Universe, we are Everything—the true Whole." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "If the aim of Emergentist spiritual practice is to assist the Universal learning process as it gains more and more Self-knowledge, Culture offers a truly privileged context in which to do so. When we understand what is driving the entire evolution of the Universe itself, something as simple as reading a book gains a whole new metaphysical significance!
>
> In broad terms, conceptual learning in all its forms becomes a key spiritual practice. Far from some luxury for intellectuals, education should be the very essence of the spiritual life for all people. This, of course, can take countless forms. But the end goal of all of them is the increase of understanding about how the world works—from physics to chemistry to biology to the social sciences, to our own phenomenological minds.
>
> ...
>
> Today, education is largely seen as only a practical necessity, something we do to get a good job to pay the bills—or, at best, something we engage in to “better ourselves.” But the intellectual life can also be (and has been) seen as a genuinely spiritual practice. Philosophia, the “love of wisdom,” was no mere academic discipline to the ancient philosophers. From Pythagoras to Plato, Epicurus to Plotinus, philosophy was a total way of life imbued with deep spiritual significance.
>
> Today, we would do well to recover this spiritual sense of the life of the mind. For it is no exaggeration to say that our learning is the very means by which suffering decreases, our ability to affect positive change grows, and God comes to manifest in more concrete form.
>
> Traditionally religious folks look to their scriptures to understand the nature and workings of God. Emergentists look to books of all kinds. The full story of God is told in physics books and biology books and in the historical records of humanity. Such stuff is not mere trivia; it is the biography of the Universe, it is the sacred history of reality.
>
> ...
>
> Unfortunately, we are often misled to believe, based on how our institutions are set up, that education ends in early adulthood. One turns a certain age and is no longer deemed a minor; one graduates from school and the reading stops. (According to recent survey data, 42% of college graduates never read another book after college!) But maturation, development, and learning are things that can and should continue throughout our lives.

> Education that is intentionally structured to help the individual progress to the highest shapes of consciousness possible is called Bildung. It is a lifelong process that meets the eternal student where they are at developmentally, with the aim of helping them transcend their unique limitations at every stage." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The advent of modernity brought an incredible advance in human knowledge as it shifted culture from a relatively simple religious traditionalism rooted in 2D consciousness to a more complex naturalistic worldview rooted in 3D consciousness. Early science led the way, opening up vast horizons of understanding through a novel methodological approach that could cut through the confusion of a noisy world and zero in on the fundamental laws and forces of the Universe.
>
> Such reductionism was revolutionary for analyzing the world according to its discrete parts. It set off a cascade of dissection and differentiation, revealing the former subjective (con)fusion endemic to religious holism. So the individual self emerged more fully from its embedding in the world; the subjective/objective split was now complete.
>
> Though an important and necessary development, this analytical process was only the first step in a two-part movement. It represented the differentiation phase, wherein a simple whole is broken into parts in order for them to be considered in isolation. Such a phase is a necessary precursor, however, to the integration phase that follows, in which these newly identified parts are then considered in their wider relational context, revealing the true complex whole.
>
> The first centuries of modern science were all about differentiation. While revelatory, this reductionistic era naturally led to a worldview of fragmentation, dislocation, and alienation, as the world became atomized and all the most important wholes (e.g., the soul, the cosmos) were broken down to their lowest denominator and ultimately “dissolved into particles.”
>
> The view of the world in the midst of the differentiation phase is thus one in which there is no grand whole according to which our lives might have meaning. More than that, our very experience of our lives as conscious, free agents is seen as only an epiphenomenal illusion, since deterministic particles are alone what’s deemed “really real.”
>
> This way of seeing remains pervasive. Indeed, it provides the presuppositions that lie behind the nihilistic perspective of so many people today. The contemporary meaning crisis was born in the cultural transition from 2D to 3D consciousness, as the incomplete movement of differentiation was misinterpreted as the absolute nature of reality. Unfortunately, the premature conclusions of early modern science have become “frozen” within the Modern cultural code, an out-of-date justification system people keep downloading to make sense of the world.
>
> Meanwhile, the integration phase has begun, and has in fact been underway for some time. Through the systematic and meta-systematic insights of 4D and 5D consciousness, respectively, the parts identified by 3D science are at last being recontextualized into their relational, networked wholes. These recontextualizations constitute the revelations of complexity science, which has been identifying the emergent nature and workings of integrated wholes. Here, emergentism as a conceptual paradigm (small e), has led the way.
>
> With this neo-holistic paradigm, the reductionist narrative can be recognized for the true yet only partial and incomplete story that it is. In its place has arrived a new, more complete cosmic story: the story of evolutionary complexification.
>
> ...
>
> Matter emerged out of the haze, and gravity condensed it into clumps. Nature retained these clumps, which became stars and black holes swirling galaxies around them. Planets emerged, turning around the stars turning around the galaxies. Dissipative adaption built on dissipative adaptation, as energy organized what it flowed through. Life clicked on, and learned its environment through ever-updating genetic code. Elaborate nervous systems networked sensory input together into an integrated whole, and Mind emerged to learn its environment through ever-updating experience. Mind complexified, gaining the capacity for language and concept, wherein self-consciousness clicked on, and Culture began its long journey of psycho-social memetic complexification.
>
> In the course of this cultural evolution through the shapes of consciousness and their associated metamemes, Culture refined its own knowledge-creation process, eventually hitting on science, a human epistemological version of the Great Algorithm of variation and selective retention. With this, it began the above-mentioned differentiation and integration process, distinguishing Nature’s many parts before realizing their emergent holistic levels of holarchic order.
>
> Culturally, this is where we find ourselves today: between the Great Tearing Apart and the Great Re-Integration. Many people remain stuck in the fragmentation of 3D consciousness and its Modern reductionistic narrative, gripped by nihilism. Others recoil from this, and seek out the comforts of old 2D religion, with the old mythic God above and Judgment Day ahead. Those who have developed a 4D perspective can see the limitations of traditional religion as well as the modern world we’ve made, but often fall victim to the radical relativism of endless contextualization, or themselves recoil to the naive belief that 0D animism is what holds the key for all our ills.
>
> What is really needed, though, is to keep going forward, to keep evolving—to complete the integration phase, wherein we regain a holistic framework required for a meaningful existence and thus a sustainable world. The new cosmic story revealed by the unifying, integrative visions from complexity science will be key to this fruition." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "We need a Religion 2.0 that has learned from the failures and limitations of Religion 1.0: namely, its dogmatic rigidity, censorship, oppressive power hierarchies, denigration of the body and the Other. We need a religion that’s open, up to date, and ethical. In short, we need a religion that works.
>
> Clearly, we must get ourselves right with purpose if we’re to survive an Anthropocene era. To use the language of systems analysis, we must find the “leverage points” for systems-level change, the points where solutions can be applied with maximal effect. And in a complex sociocultural system, where else is such an Archimedean Point to be found but in people’s beliefs—in their psychic orientations to reality, their foundational philosophies and unspoken axioms about the world? An intervention at this fundamental level for individuals can have vast, cascading effects on the larger systems they inhabit. Could Emergentism provide such a lever?
>
> The sort of “religion that’s not a religion” explored in this book is not just another closed-canon, close-minded set of beliefs either imposed, adopted, or rejected. Emergentism is open-source, co-created, and personally developed. Its cosmic story comes from scientists; its scriptures, from poets and artists. It is a religion of evolution and development by means of evolution and development. It is a religion of knowledge creation, refinement, and correction, and so itself shall be continually refined and corrected according to the same mechanisms the Universe itself has used to gain Self-knowledge since the dawn of time.
>
> Today, when people feel increasingly beset by despair and meaninglessness, Emergentism offers the invitation to participate in the manifestation of ultimate knowledge, beauty, power, and goodness in the world. At a time when people feel adrift and lost, without purpose, Emergentism calls us to help God incarnate and thereby realize the very telos of the Universe. At a time when everything feels pointless and nothing seems to matter, we are summoned to an epic cultural project to build the Cathedral of a new worldview, a new religion, a new age and a new Divinity—by means of our own unique and special flavor of individuality.

> "The word “complexity” just means “to weave together,” and that’s what the tapestry of existence ultimately is: an ever more intricate embroidery revealing an ever more refined image of an ever-evolving cosmos.
>
> Forging more intricate relationships is what the Universe does—and keeps doing, since out of those relationships come new entities with entirely new abilities which in turn create the possibility for even more novel relationships to cohere, and so on. So quarks relate to form atoms, atoms relate to form molecules, molecules relate to form cells, etc., all the way up to complex, conscious, caring human beings, who themselves relate to one another to form a vast global society rapidly coming to increasing knowledge of the cosmos.

> Every “thing,” then, is really a process: a dynamic relational event unfolding in relation to all other dynamic relational events. That’s what the Universe is. That’s what you are—a mind-blowing moment at the edge of this 14-billion-year process of cosmic complex-ification and evolution, headed for still greater complexity…" - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "A truly metamodern spirituality is precisely that which brings a complexity lens to bear on the things that matter most. Part of that entails looking at the very evolution of worldviews and meaning structures as a process of complexification—a vital, promising, but (as yet) under-explored field of study. More broadly, it entails engaging complexification, integration, and emergence as fundamental dynamics of the self-organizing cosmos—processes in which we ourselves take part through our own journeys of learning, development, integration, and self-transcendence." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Meaning, I will argue, arises out of the most fundamental dynamics of the physical world: energy and information. Indeed, bold as it may sound, it is precisely via the thermodynamic forces driving cosmic evolution as a whole that meaning evolves into more complex biological and social registers such as we experience as conscious agents. Meaning is a particular kind of information—namely, information linking entities with their environments in ways that causally impact their viability and flourishing." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "If entities are defined as stable transmissions of information through time, then continued, accurate transmission has intrinsic significance to that entity so in-formed. Some information transmission has an existential import. Likewise, when the information identifying an entity requires energy from the environment with which it is coupled to be sustained, then information about the environment must not only be accurate but helpful. That is, it must convey information about the environment in a manner that can be of use to sustaining the information that defines the entity.
>
> These sorts of ideas can be framed in the language of information theory. Specifically, because systems exist in environments, the information between them is correlated. Information about the state of the system directly relates to information about the state of its environment, and vice versa. This coupling of information between system states and environmental states is called “mutual information” since it entails a statistical correlation between the two.
>
> Now, as we have seen, maintaining information requires energy. For a system to resist entropy and maintain itself, it must acquire this needed energy from its environment. Information from the environment can be relevant to that end—or not. Indeed, there can be all sorts of “information” conveyed in Shannon’s sense; what determines its true relevance, however, is adjudicated by how the mutual information of the system–environment relationship directly influences the system’s continued existence. That is, at the most fundamental level, mutual information can be meaningful to the extent it causally impacts the specific existential requirements of a thing-in-context by helping it resist entropic breakdown. Only when information contributes to the capacity of something to continue existing in the face of entropy does it acquire meaning to that thing. This is what information can be about. When it is, that information is called meaning." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Information is meaningful for an entity to the degree that it assists in helping it resist entropy...
>
> At the most basic level, then, environmental information causally tied to a system’s informational persistence is a special kind of information that we can call meaning. Meaningless information, by contrast, offers nothing to an entity’s continuation. Expending energy attending only to meaningless information about the environment extracts a true cost from an entity and is therefore existentially hazardous. If investments of energy into gaining information do not yield returns of energy commensurate with the expense, the entity risks entropic dissolution...
>
> Meaning, they say, increases a system’s viability. By “viability,” though, they are not just referring to living systems. Kolchinsky and Wolpert’s theory of semantic information is truly generalizable in that it “applies not only to living beings but also any physical system—whether a rock, a hurricane or a cell.” All things face entropy. The viability of some entities is simply more sensitive to environmental conditions than others, but all are susceptible to annihilation. Meaning, it seems, has a truly expansive sense that can refer even to nonbiological entities—a point we shall repeatedly return to.
>
> In sum, Kolchinsky and Wolpert’s work, along with that of physicists like Carlo Rovelli, reveal that information can be useful or useless, relevant or irrelevant, about something important or a harmful waste of time and energy. Information is relevant if it gives an entity causal power to maintain itself in its environment. Such information is then meaningful information, which emerges through the impinging of reality on agent behavior, which must adapt to its conditions to maintain its continued existence. Once we appreciate these fundamental dynamics about how systems relate to meaningful information in context, we can begin to understand the universal importance of learning.
>
> ...
>
> As entities complexify, they become more adept at processing meaningful information from their environments. Expressed in concise terms: “life’s thermodynamic imperative necessitates knowledge accumulation.” What Azarian calls “knowledge” here I will call meaning (or meaningful knowledge, when appropriate), following Kolchinsky, Wolpert, Rovelli, and others. That is the sort of information that has true relevance and significance for an entity—knowledge with causal power on the continued viability and flourishing of systems in contexts.
>
> And why, exactly? Some basic philosophical reflection on this idea reveals it to be both tautologically simple yet existentially profound. Without meaning, an entity would cease to exist, such that there would be nothing to speak of, nothing to consider. There would be no information of it at all, nothing to distinguish it, nothing to define it. If meaning is information that is relevant to the robust continuance of an entity, then the very fact that anything exists entails the existence of meaning. For a thing to be entails that it has meaning.
>
> From the very logic of semantic information such as Kolchinsky and Wolpert articulate it, it is clear that entities more effective at attending to meaningful information will be more viable and thus more evolutionarily successful. There is, then, a natural evolutionary incentive for entities to acquire increasing information about themselves and their environment in furtherance of this process. More information processing capacity, though, requires entities that are themselves more informationally rich. As this feedback cycle unfolds, entities complexify, which both demands and occasions access to still more energy from the environment. And with energy increasingly needed to sustain such high-informational order in the face of entropy, the energy-information cycle perpetuates itself.
>
> When we appreciate that 1) entities exist (i.e., faithfully convey their informational identity into future states) through correlation with the information of environmental contexts (“mutual information”), 2) this correlation is the basis of meaning, and 3) entities are complexifying via this informational exchange, then we are led to an interesting conclusion: namely, that meaning itself must be complexifying." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "If energy, information, and structural order are indeed all related, then we should expect to see a clear correlation between these measures in a complexifying universe. As entities move further from equilibrium, they should require more energy to sustain their informational richness and organizational depth. That is, we should expect to find greater energy flows per increasing measure of structural complexity. And, indeed, that is precisely what the calculations reveal.
>
> In his book Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature, physicist Eric Chaisson charts the universe’s trajectory towards greater complexity by mapping these interrelated measures across big history. In full accordance with the Second Law, he writes,
>
> 'the growing departure from thermodynamic equilibrium allows the cosmos to produce increasing amounts of net entropy and macroscopic information. We thereby have a means to appreciate in the main, if perhaps not yet understand the particulars, the observed rise in complexity throughout the eons of cosmic evolution.'
>
> From an initial state of homogeneity soon after the Big Bang, the universe began to self-organize and complexify. Chaisson’s graphs all show a cosmos moving further from equilibrium, with entities of increasing free energy rate density and informational richness over time.
>
> Indeed, using free energy rate density (Φ��) calculations alone, Chaisson charts a clear trend towards complexification from matter to plant life to animals to culture...
>
> ...
>
> Learning thus appears to be the natural consequence (and driver) of a complexifying universe, as more energetically dense entities emerge to embody and encode more information about their environments.
>
> In this process, the very means by which information gets processed complexify, with novel computational mechanisms emerging out of earlier ones to process new kinds of information. As physicist and quantum computing theorist Seth Lloyd expresses it:

> "To say it again, meaning of this kind has causal power; to meaningfully know a thing is to integrate its information in an adaptive way. Meaning is what enhances viability at every level by informing the behavioral interventions needed for entities to thrive.
>
> Thus, the more complex an entity is, the more complex information it must process across the numerous planes of reality. While all semantic information does ultimately “cash out” at the thermodynamic level, there are, it must be repeatedly stressed, novel layers to meaning introduced as complexity unfolds. These novel layers emerge as more complex information is processed through the universal learning process, such that meaningful information gets generated differently as you move up the complexity stack but accumulates in an accretive way. Meaning for cells is processed as genetic information; but meaning for an animal modifies mere genetic selection with an overlay of neuronally meaningful information processing. For humans, viability-enhancing meaning must be sought across both of these informational domains as well as through symbolic exchanges." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Teleological or “goal-directed” behavior is thus evident even in prebiotic entities. That is, all of this learning unfolds entirely on the plane of Matter. And while the details of abiogenesis out of dissipative adaptation remain to be filled in, there are promising signs that the evident continuity between material dissipative structures and biological organisms (which are clearly a subset of the former) will offer new revelations about the origins of Life. At the very least, it shows us that an entity need not be a full-blown biological organism to exist in an entity–field relationship whose correlation defines meaningful knowledge to the entity. Rather, a very crude, simplistic form of meaning exists even for a whirlpool (as Kolchinsky and Wolpert’s framework posits).
>
> While this may seem at first to diminish the very idea of meaning, it actually does the opposite, I believe. For, by showing that meaning connects down into the very rudiments of reality, we can see the error (common these days) of presuming it to be merely subjective, or as a thing only humans “make up” as some arbitrary “social construction.” To the contrary, meaning, along with a related word, “teleology,” are both quite real—something cyberneticists and complexity scientists have long appreciated as they have endeavored to explain goal-directed material phenomena like dissipative structures. As Azarian concludes, with dissipative structures

> 'a natural pressure to minimize free energy and produce entropy spontaneously creates an ordered structure with an objective function. With the emergence of dissipative structures, we see the emergence of purpose in nature…'" - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Of course, the universal learning process (and thus meaning) becomes appreciably clearer to recognize when, around 3.8 billion years ago, we see its first truly sublime product: Life—a particular kind of dissipative structure that can also reproduce itself via meaningful information. Such is the system–environment knowledge contained in the “genetic code.” Here, meaning truly comes into view, as the goal-directed character of biological behavior becomes overt and undeniable.
>
> On this point, the work of neuroanthropologist Terence Deacon has been especially elucidating, offering a profound contribution to the reappraisal of meaning and teleology in the biological sciences. Since Darwin, teleology had been summarily eschewed from naturalistic descriptions of life and its development, replaced instead by an emphasis on blind meandering and undirected chance. Having identified the crucial efficient cause of natural selection (that is, the basic material cause-effect mechanism), biologists of the 19th and early 20th centuries believed they could then dispense with the idea of any teleological final cause such as Aristotle had once identified for organisms—which is to say, the idea that their end, goal, or purpose structurally in-forms them.
>
> Ultimately, however, the failures of a purely reductionistic biology to adequately explain biological organisms without reference to goals and aims has led to a paradigm shift in the field, as emergentist frameworks from complexity science have helped shed important new light on long-vexing problems about biological behavior. Deacon’s work is a significant contribution to this paradigm shift. In his comprehensive 2012 book Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter, he offers a scientifically robust and philosophically compelling reconsideration of teleology’s role in biology. By emphasizing the inherent lack or need of goal-directed entities (i.e., their “incompleteness”), Deacon removes teleology from a speculative metaphysical register and places it comfortably within a processual physical one. This allows us to see the commonalities that exist between all entities intrinsically constituted in processual relation to an absent goal state. As he puts it:
>
> 'Such concepts as information, function, purpose, meaning, intention, significance, consciousness, and value are intrinsically defined by their fundamental incomplete-ness. They exist only in relation to something they are not.'
>
> Such absence thus “motivates” (in the most basic etymological sense, we might say: “causes to move, animates”) the behavior of biological entities.
>
> This dynamic is clearest in highly complex organisms like ourselves, who aspire, wish, will, intend, etc. Meaning and purpose are clear, we might say, within the PTB’s “person–society field” of Culture. But appreciating the deeper dynamic of motivational absence allows us to trace the quality of such meaning back down through less complex forms—which is precisely what we have been endeavoring to do here." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Information gets its causal power to the degree it is of value to the existence of the entity—i.e., whether it assists the entity in its goal to remain far from equilibrium. Value, then, is also an inherent product of the entity–field relationship. Value does not exist “in and of itself,” but in the dynamic adaptive contexts relating organism to ecology, animal to environment, etc.—that is, in the process of energy informing structures adapted to specific environments.
>
> Another way to express this is to say that value (“good vs. bad”) must be understood as deriving from the entity–field relationship, wherein there is a relative “good for” an entity, as well as a relative “bad for” that entity. For a bacterium on the Life plane, navigating via chemotaxis towards a collection of nutrients is good for its continued existence, aiding its efforts to obtain free energy to maintain itself in the face of entropy and so persist. Conversely, navigating into an area flooded by toxins is bad for the bacterium, threatening its basic integrity as an organism. Even though the single-celled organism is among the most primitive of entities on the Life plane, we can still identify values for the organism, which have meaning for it as information with causal power relative to its flourishing or annihilation." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Meaning and value exist, not as mere social constructs or subjective inventions, but as real aspects of the world. They do not, we must stress, inhere in things themselves, as essences bestowed (such as traditional theological thinking proposed); but neither are they purely subjective experiences overlaid onto the world (such as modern reductionistic thinking has tended to assume). Rather, they arise in the dynamic relationship between an entity in its contextual field. Meaning is real because it is contextual. Meaning, you could say, is a real relationship." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "All this entailed a massive upgrade for the universal learning process, allowing information of much greater complexity to be processed at much greater speed by evolving animals. It also entailed that animals develop increasingly sophisticated internal models of the world they inhabited. As Richard Dawkins has put it, “Survival machines that can simulate the future are one jump ahead of survival machines who can only learn on the basis of overt trial and error. The trouble with overt trial is that it takes time and energy. The trouble with overt error is that it is often fatal. Simulation is both safer and faster.” At the complexity level of Mind, animals learn to simulate the world with greater and greater reliability in their bid to reduce ignorance about the environment and remain far from equilibrium.
>
> This is the core insight of Karl Friston’s theory of cognition, Active Inference, which is based on the “free energy principle” of predictive processing. According to this “unified brain theory,” the mind is a complex adaptive system that allows animals to stay far from equilibrium specifically by modelling their environment and continually updating that mental model through comparisons with how well actual sensory inputs match its expectations. Based on these calibrations, animals adapt their behavior and get better at predicting the world—AKA, learning.
>
> To achieve this, however, renders meaning into a mental computational challenge. What information about the world, exactly, should be included in the nervous system’s mental model? What can be safely ignored? There is, we have seen, an infinite amount of “information” in Shannon’s sense that might be considered. How does a cognitive entity single out only the relevant subset of that information to optimally navigate the environment? How can neurons detect viability? How can significance be computed?
>
> John Vervaeke, a 4E cognitive scientist and professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, has proposed a theory of “relevance realization” that addresses this issue and extends the sort of meaning we have been considering into the register of Mind...
>
> Consonant with our previous considerations of meaning, Vervaeke’s theory of relevance realization emphasizes the coupling of system and environment. He refers to the entity–field relationship at this level as the “agent–arena relationship,” the domain of agential subjects operating in objective contexts. Appreciating the crucial insight that meaning arises in relational exchange between subjects and their environment, Vervaeke coins the term “transjective” to capture the mutually-informing aspect of the subjective/objective agent–arena relationship. Meaning, he says, is transjective, arising from the dynamic interplay of subjects with(in) their objective world. This idea of “transjectivity” is helpful, and I will use it going forward to refer to the specific dynamic inherent to all entity–field relationships, as it captures a key reality of meaning at every level of complexity.
>
> For embodied, mobile agents navigating environments to achieve their goals, the thermodynamic imperative manifests as solving various situational problems (e.g., acquiring food, avoiding predators, etc.). To meet these challenges, says Vervaeke, agents must learn to accurately identify the relevant information in their “salience landscape.” To this end, minded animals have evolved neurocognitive mechanisms that assist in relevance realization—to filter out probably unmeaningful information and home in on probably meaningful information. As Vervaeke puts it, “for an agent to take action in even relatively simple circumstances it must somehow intelligently ignore a great deal of information.”
>
> This idea has clear connections to Kolchinsky and Wolpert’s more basic formulation of meaning considered at the outset. As they articulated it, “there is a connection between ‘paying attention to the right information’, as measured by semantic efficiency, and being thermodynamically efficient.” Meaning is only a subset of all possible information. Vervaeke’s relevance realization would model how minded animals learn to “pay attention to the right information.” Indeed, so fundamental does this idea appear to virtually all aspects of cognition that he declares, “relevance realization is the criterion of the cognitive.”
>
> ...
>
> In short, Cognitive Learning is a complexification process—a finding that shouldn’t surprise in light of our considerations so far.
>
> Such cognitive complexification amounts to a dynamic developmental process. As Vervaeke puts it elsewhere: “[C]ognition is inherently developmental in nature, rather than development just being the peripheral issue of how cognition emerges. Thus, we may speculate that developmental psychology ought be seen as central to cognitive psychology.”...

> Consciousness. With consciousness, meaning becomes experiential for the first time. Meaning becomes subjective. It becomes, that is, what we as humans intuitively think of when we describe anything as meaningful or significant in some way. It becomes felt as meaningful.
>
> But how did consciousness emerge out of unconscious cognitive information processing? In their 2019 book The Evolution of the Sensitive Soul: Learning and the Origins of Consciousness, Simona Ginsburg and Eva Jablonka trace this evolution in some detail. Consciousness, they posit, is a direct product of the neuronal infrastructure laid down by animals as they developed more comprehensive, integrated world modelling capacities. Cognitive Learning, they say, was what led to subjectivity. They write:
>
> 'When we think about consciousness and sentience, we do not usually think about learning. What comes to mind are the immediate experiences of seeing a sunflower, of feeling a stab of pain or a flood of joy, of hearing the song of a blackbird, of smelling freshly baked bread, of tasting a ripe banana. These experiences can be fleeting, and we may soon forget them. But how did animals come, evolutionarily and developmentally, to have such experiences? …[L]earning was the basis on which this experiencing process was constructed. There is no point in sensory discrimination in a rapidly yet recurrently changing world if we are unable to remember it and use it to improve our lot. Moreover, we suggest that even fleeting experiences involve processes of stabilization and updating that are intimately related to learning, as is most obvious during early development. …All pattern-perception and compound-action selection depend on learning because all rely on the (learned) construction of updatable models of the world in which the animal acts.'
>
> Specifically, Ginsburg and Jablonka see subjective consciousness emerging in animals as they transitioned from simpler learning methods like reflex-based behavioral conditioning (or “associative learning”) to the full repertoire of what they call “unlimited associative learning,” which saw broad hierarchical integration of such responses along with a developed memory system that could store learned information in a temporally continuous manner.
>
> One way to summarize this development in a way that brings to the fore our present concern is to say that multiple domains of cognitive meaning became integrated in animals, such that distinct purpose and value systems “synced up” in a holistic manner so as to better guide the organism’s efforts to stay far from equilibrium. Ginsburg and Jablonka speak of a single, integrated “value currency” emerging from this integration. Simplistically put, you might imagine how each sense organ has its own way to tag information as potentially helpful or potentially harmful for viability. Feces or food trigger repulsion or attraction for the nose; a sharp rock or a lover’s smooth body trigger repulsion or attraction for the skin; sight of a predator or a mate trigger repulsion or attraction for the eyes, etc. Integrating all these unique interpretive senses into a holistic unit, the self, with a single value currency—pain or pleasure—is necessary for the sort of conscious experience we are familiar with. When this happened as part of the evolutionary process, diverse meanings became unified into a single teleological, normative experience, and consciousness was born. Ginsburg and Jablonka write:
>
> 'There are constant changes in the world of a mobile animal, and it needs to detect them with its sense organs and respond to them through the flexible coordination of its muscle sheets. The value-reinforcement system has to accommodate these world and action changes and deal with their potentially conflicting effects. (Should the animal first satisfy its need for food and approach object X or retreat because it smells the scent of a predator in the area?) The animal must therefore have a “common (value) currency” for consistently evaluating types of world and body state over another type according to its value, which is context-dependent. As several scholars have suggested, pleasures and displeasures can be seen as such overall and general currencies of value, which can evaluate any percept or action.'
>
> Consciousness, then, is the result of hierarchically integrating animal meanings in an enduring, temporally extended way. Experience is inherently evaluative, and inherently driven to detect meaning.
>
> Ginsburg and Jablonka compile a list of “neurobiologists’ criteria” for consciousness that they say their account successfully meets. The list includes seven criteria which, I believe, can themselves be distilled down into just three categories: what I would call intentionality, integration, and identity (Table 1.2). Consciousness is the hierarchical integration of ententional learning processes into a single subjective identity experience with intentionality.
>
> Consciousness, then, represents the holistic integration of ententional, meaning-driven cognitive mechanisms into a temporally extended manner, such that a distinct self emerges for whom such value states are experienced as subjective qualia like pleasure and pain.
>
> In this way, the meaningful information processed by cognitive entities as good for and bad for form the basis of nature’s first subjective experiences, whose valences reflect the binary response patterns of what I prefer to call attraction and repulsion. Subjective valence states arise when this value-laden knowledge is networked in reference to the animal as a whole, to be broadcast coherently throughout the body in order to perform the requisite response as a unit that orients itself towards its goal states. Through this integration of information, the organism acquires the new functionality of the experience of “pleasure” (good for) and “pain” (bad for).
>
> Can the level of this integration be measured? The integrated information theory (IIT) of consciousness developed by Giulio Tononi and colleagues posits a specific metric, phi (Φ), for assessing how complexly wired or integrated the neurons of a nervous system are with one another, and directly identifies this measure with the level of sentient awareness of an animal. More conservatively, we can say that such integration levels likely correlate directly to degrees of consciousness, in which case Φ level, if it could be directly measured, could help us quantify conscious depth.
>
> ...
>
> ... In short, different brains and nervous systems in different transjective contexts will be structured differently according to niche and need, though the underlying mechanics of meaning and relevance realization remain the same. All animals have their transjective values, their relative senses of meaning, which will be experienced differently at the subjective level and feel differently relative to neuronal complexity.
>
> ...
>
> From all this, we can conclude that meaning and value are circumscribed by the consciousness of the animal as it has been shaped through adaptation to its environmental conditions. Meanings and values emerge through the transjective system–environment relationship, with an objective aspect that goes all the way down to thermodynamic necessity and a subjective aspect colored by the values constitutive of the exchange.

> When we combine these older insights with those of contemporary neuroscience, we can actually begin to link these qualitative distinctions with quantifiable data. Having seen that the level of neuronal complexity plays a crucial role in the origin and evolution of consciousness, we can relate the growth in brain size and integration to the complexification of meaning over time. More integrated nervous systems lead to more complex minds, whose Umwelts will be more expansive in sensory input and active capacity. The evolution of meaning parallels the evolution of consciousness.
>
> One clear example of this appears in the emergence of social values among animals. With the deepening of subjective, felt experience, reproduction and the rearing of offspring become richly emotional activities. More neuronally complex, intelligent mammals form social bonds and relationships with other members of their group that are mediated by value-laden informational exchanges. That is, relationships with other animals have considerable meaning to them, and this is mediated via strong qualia states. One obvious instance of this is to be found in the mother-child bond of advanced primates, but dolphins, elephants, and whales have also been documented exhibiting strong social emotional bonding relationships. Such emotional investment into social dynamics also plays out in dominance hierarchies, as males strive to assume positions in the social hierarchy that will render their genetic continuance more viable (e.g., becoming the alpha in a group of gorillas).
>
> This extension of value and meaning into the social domain opens up new levels of complexity that animals must navigate. As we have seen, complexity begets more complexity, as more complex environmental conditions require more complex adaptive solutions. So, as complexifying nervous systems meant bigger brains that could navigate social environments, those new environmental conditions fueled a drive towards even more neuronal complexity. In such cases, evolution selected for bigger brains with even more integrated neuronal activity and conscious depth.
>
> This “encephalization” process of generating bigger and bigger brains, then, can be read as an empirical indicator of meaning’s complexification—the spatio-structural flipside of rising Φ and thus deepening subjective consciousness, with increasing intelligence orienting its growing learning capacities towards a more expansive field of value. We see it characterizing the evolution of social primates up to advanced hominids, when the process suddenly explodes exponentially around Homo habilis.

> In function, symbolic language appears as a natural extension of earlier Cognitive Learning processes attentive to meaning. Henriques notes:
>
> '[T]he human mind is a neurocognitive behavioral investment system that symbolically tags objects and changes in the form of nouns and verbs. …[T]the neurocognitive architecture of the preverbal human mind…is structured to: (a) attend to relevant objects in the environment; (b) identify changes that are happening in predictable and unpredictable ways; (c) determine what are desirable and undesirable outcomes; and (d) direct subsequent work effort (i.e., behavioral investment) in an attempt to realize desirable outcomes and avoid undesired ones based on probabilistic expectations. In short, evolution built our primate phenomenology to see the world in behavioral terms. In addition, nature added a language acquisition device…that allowed us humans to generate a symbolic-syntactical representation of our phenomenological experience.'
>
> In this way, language emerges directly out of our pre-existing Cognitive Learning capacities to mentally represent the world; which, we have seen, emerged out of our Genetic Learning capacities to biologically encode knowledge of the world in our genome; which emerged out of Structural Learning capacities to maintain informational identity by adapting to the energic pressures of the environment. Symbolic communication simply continues the universal learning process into a new register through the introduction of a novel information processing system: language.
>
> ...
>
> Whatever its origin, though, it is clear that, once begun, symbolic language precipitated an autocatalytic process leading to a profound qualitative shift in the lived reality of Homo sapiens. For out of this transformation came the truly essential aspects of the human experience: namely, the self-conscious individual ego that constitutes the human person as well as the conceptually-mediated technologies, institutions, and collective visions that constitute collective human culture. With these, a whole new kind of meaning emerged in the world—the kind that will preoccupy us for the remainder of this book series." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Finally, we come to the sort of semantic information processing unique to human beings: Symbolic Learning. Such learning is distinct from all other kinds in that it participates in inter-subjective socio-linguistic contexts. The day a child is born, it becomes immersed in a linguistic world, a cultural Umwelt of shared words, concepts, ideas, etc. Indeed, long before it can actively participate in this discursive world itself, a child is spoken to, sung to, and made a passive recipient of conversations, symbols, social customs, and so forth. By means of these, a person will gradually learn to navigate their world through reference to shared abstract symbols.
>
> Such symbolic information is hardly the invention of just the rearing parents, of course, but predates and transcends them, too. Child-rearers are largely passing on what they themselves learned in their own rearing and cultural immersion. Education, from the beginning, aims to initiate humans into a transpersonal socio-linguistic world. This is called enculturation or socialization: the process by which human offspring are slowly molded into active participants within their linguistically-mediated culture.
>
> ... During this time, children have to learn not only the kinds of sensory-motor skills that other animals develop to physically navigate the world, as well as the group dynamics of complex social mammals, but also the intricacies of the purely symbolic world of their culture’s meaningful concepts, ideas, stories, norms, etc.
>
> The symbolic language that enables such mental activity moves beyond mere ostensive reference (e.g., communicative signals tagged to specific phenomenal signs, such as animals use) to an entirely new register of cognitive organization. This is marked by the appearance of grammar and true propositional claims. Not just “gazelle, there,” but “a gazelle is there.” This important transition, argues Henriques, marks the advent of Culture proper, as it initiates the uniquely human dynamics of justification.
>
> According to Justification Systems Theory (the UTOK metatheoretical framework for understanding the basis of the Culture plane of complexity; see Figure 1.7), human language’s development of propositional claims opened up a new discursive space of claim and question, argument and counter-argument. With the linguistic declaration “a gazelle is there” comes potential rejoinders: “Is it?” “Are you sure?” “How do you know?” etc. This development from animal communication to propositional justificatory language set off a cascade of adaptive pressures and opportunities that would radically transform the Umwelt of Homo sapiens, marking the transition from minded animals to genuinely enculturated persons.
>
> Justification Systems Theory is an ambitious metatheory that would account for those aspects that make human beings unique from other animals by revealing how the emergence of language utterly reshaped human consciousness and meaning-making. Its three core claims Henriques summarizes this way:
>
> '(1) the evolution of propositional language generated question–answer dynamics framed as the adaptive problem of justification, and this in turn shaped both the evolution of human self-consciousness and human culture such that; (2) the nature of human consciousness can be framed by the “Updated Tripartite Model” that differentiates it into three different domains of (a) the experiential self, (b) the private ego, and (c) the public persona; and (3) humans are transformed into persons as a function of being socialized into systems of justification, such that, relative to other animals, human persons operate in a new complex adaptive plane that can effectively be framed as Culture with a capital “C.”'
>
> Understanding these developments is key if we are to appreciate how the meaningful information processed through Symbolic Learning emerges out of and builds upon that of Cognitive Learning. So let’s unpack them—paying special attention, as we do, to the meaning dynamics as they unfold.
>
> (1) Animals, we have seen, are goal-directed, aim-driven entities. Their complex nervous systems allow them to develop and store mental models of reality, physically navigate through those simulated environments, and provide the conscious animal as a whole with ongoing emotional feedback on their actions to help direct its ongoing decision-making and energetic investment. For social animals whose survival depends on successfully operating in collective groups, these Cognitive Learning processes are naturally extended to include mappings of social dynamics as well. Meaning becomes more “indirect” as survival is here contingent on attending not just to one’s immediate needs and goals but to the collective’s needs and goals as an extension and support of one’s own flourishing. Meaningful information now includes how to optimally navigate the behavior of other animals with their goals and intentions.
>
> Without language, though, even social animals remain completely isolated within their own individual meaning-making frame—the subjective conscious experience of an animal’s normatively-directed emotional life. The intentions of others remain opaque, gleaned only through outwardly manifested behaviors (e.g., a powerful blow, a mating dance, etc.). Though mapping a social world, meaning is processed only by and for individuals through the neuronal information processing system of those individual animals.
>
> But symbolic language changes this entirely. How? By tearing down the wall isolating meaning within the mind of the individual and opening up the world of meaning to inter-subjective exchange. Not just the outward behavior but the originary, motivating, subjective meaning content of an individual mind can now become a shared object of concern. Subjective understanding and intention become interpersonal understanding and intention as the inner world of conscious reasons breaks its confines with a single word: “Why?”
>
> With such an advance, a cosmos of brute, declarative fact learned the interrogative—and meaning slipped the prison of the solipsistic self. Henriques writes:
>
> 'Unlike chimps, language allows humans to ask and be asked about the thought processes associated with their behaviors. Questions such as “Why did you do that?; What gives you the right to behave that way?; Why should I trust you?” force the issue. Obtaining information about what others think, what they have done, what they plan to do is obviously important for navigating the social environment in modern times and given that humans have always been an intensely social species, there is every reason to believe that it was equally essential in the ancestral past. So once people developed the capacity to use language to access the thought patterns of others, they likely did so with vigor.'
>
> The question–answer dynamic this birthed is entirely novel to the Culture plane of complexity, rendered possible by the unique nature of symbolic information processing, which is able to “move between” thinking agents in a way completely impossible for mere neuronal processing. Whereas Genetic Learning occurs at the phylogenetic level of the collective species, and Cognitive Learning at the ontogenetic level of the individual organism, Symbolic Learning allows ontogenetic knowledge to move between individual and collective levels. As Henriques puts it:
>
> 'Language-based thoughts, however, are different. This is because propositions move through the nervous system and the boundary of the skin and out into the world and back again without losing their informational form. …Our capacity to share in language means that a direct highway of mental information is opened between us. …Although I cannot directly share with you my subjective conscious experience of redness, I can directly share my self-conscious, language-based description of redness and any other language-based thoughts I have.'
>
> Simply put, symbolic language renders inter-subjective communication possible. It allows me to translate the cognitive information processing I experience internally into externally transmittable data that others can incorporate into their own learning. Justification is meaning-sharing. It is made possible by the ability to transfer meanings processed through Cognitive Learning into an externalizable symbolic language that encodes our reasons and intentions in a manner others can decipher and engage. In the process, a novel information processing system emerges and meaning becomes collectively linguistic.
>
> (2) Such meaning-sharing, though, places a new burden on the individual, for it demands that they first be sufficiently self-conscious of their own internal cognitive processing and personal meanings if they are to properly translate them into language for others. That is, I must develop a self-reflective stance towards my own internal cognitive experience and decision-making—a higher-order perspective on my own intentions, wants, desires, etc.—if I am to model them to others using language. With this demand, a new kind of individual had to develop: the self-conscious person. If consciousness emerged when animal value systems became integrated under a higher-order organization of a singular “I” that could recursively relate to itself through self-modeling, then self-consciousness emerges when that conscious totality loops back yet again on itself to model itself through language.[101] So out of the unreflective experiential self is born the “ego.”
>
> Henriques’s model of the human psyche emerges from this crucial insight. Each person has a pre-linguistic subjective experience like other animals who operate on the plane of Mind. But language affords us the means of rendering this experience communicable, both to ourselves and to others, in pursuance of our normative goals. Doing so leads to the production of a personal ego, which is that private, internal “voice” continually narrating and justifying our experience to ourselves in linguistic terms.
>
> Such egos are inherently linguistic in nature—an internal narrative of self-justification continually translating raw emotional experience into the language of symbolic speech. I do not just feel hungry and eat. I think, “I’m hungry. I’m going to get something to eat.” More than that, I engage in an ongoing internal monologue of justifications in such terms: “Should I eat the last slice of pizza in the fridge? I think my brother was saving it, so I probably shouldn’t. Then again, maybe it’s not that important to him? Plus, he wouldn’t know it was me… No, I’ll leave it for him. He seemed interested in it. Besides, he’d definitely assume I did it and get mad at me and then it’d be a whole thing. I’ll just make a sandwich.” In pursuing my own goals, it is as though I have an internalized other person continually demanding justification for my actions—an enculturated voice in my head asking how my reasons and meanings mesh with others’.[102] The stories I tell myself about myself to organize and justify my behavior, that’s my ego.
>
> For many reasons, however, individuals do not communicate to others the full contents of their egoic thoughts. Individuals’ goals, including maximizing social influence and prestige, are often better pursued by selectively filtering publicly communicated thoughts from privately held ones. The strategic version one presents of themselves to the world, then, is their persona.
>
> The resulting three-part conception of the human individual is thus composed of (a) an experiential self (the conscious animal mind), (b) an ego (a linguistically-mediated narrative reflection on the experiential self), and (c) a persona (the self-concept one projects to others in an effort to maximize success in their social context). Henriques calls this an “update” to the older “tripartite self” (cf. Freud’s id, ego, and superego), and one that does justice to insights from both folk and academic psychology by placing all within a metatheoretical framework rooted in the planes of complexity that have emerged over cosmic evolution (Figure 1.12).
>
> (3) The emergence of language as a means of justification, then, profoundly altered the Umwelt of Homo sapiens as the new dynamics transformed the entity–field relationship from “animal–environment” to “person–society” by linking self-conscious, self-justifying egos to other self-conscious, self-justifying egos through meaning-sharing. Just as animal Mind represented a networking of meaning-driven cellular Life to produce an emergent plane of complexity, so human Culture represents a networking of meaning-driven minds to produce an emergent plane of complexity. Culture, then, is the product of many conscious animals using symbolic communication to integrate subjective information into an inter-subjective world model with collective normative goal-states.
>
> Indeed, this networking of shared meanings is why we must speak of justification systems. As an inherently cultural, interpersonal phenomenon, justification never occurs in isolation. Just as there are no “private languages” (as Wittgenstein observed), there are no private justifications. Linguistic meaning-sharing inherently cuts across levels and scales, with person-to-person transjective relationships embedded in micro-, meso-, and macro-level justification contexts.
>
> ...
>
> When we consider the sort of mind-networking that is implicit in the socialization of human egos within linguistically-mediated Culture, then, we are necessarily considering a collective, transpersonal context for human meaning-formation that transcends individuals. It is the individual-sustaining group that is very much the meaning-defining entity now, similar to the way the animal becomes the meaning-defining entity when cells network together into a multicellular organism. The cell-level meaning does not vanish; but it does shift to accommodate a broader context and serve the normative needs of a broader whole. With the emergence of Culture, meaning becomes networked into a macro-level justification system that serves to orient the goals of the collective and keep it far from equilibrium. Meaning at this highest-level macro-scale is called a worldview.
>
> Worldviews are collective justification systems that serve to direct the normative goals of society as a whole. From this vantage, Azarian writes,
>
> 'An individual’s value is not about physical ability or intelligence; it is about how one contributes to preserving the stability of the social organism we call society. By being unique, or having a unique perspective that you share with others through conversation, writing, or art, you are contributing to the diversity of ideas that collectively create the world model of the superorganism. For social organisms, we call that world model a cultural worldview—which can be a religion, national identity, political ideology, or cosmic philosophy. We can make use of metaphor by saying that the worldview is the Markov blanket for the social organism, because it is what binds the independent agents together to form a collective whole with internal states that are distinct from the external states of the environment, even though there is no tangible physical barrier, like a cell membrane or an integumentary system.'
>
> So, just as the individual cells of the nervous system all contribute to the configuration of a world model that aids the viability of an animal in context, so individual human minds in a collective justification system all contribute normative inputs to the world model of the group. “What is the biological function of a cultural worldview?” asks Azarian. “The worldview, like the world models that came before it, is a strategy for survival, but at this scale it is a strategy for collective survival, for the continued persistence of the superorganism.”
>
> With this framework in place, we can begin to appreciate the dynamics of Symbolic Learning as a specific manifestation of the universal learning process. For, as Azarian suggests, the value of individuals is their ability to contribute diverse and novel inputs to the collective world model. When they do, they update the model the same way the nervous system updates its model in the face of novelty and surprise. Collectives can learn, adjusting linguistic-conceptual systems of understanding and justification by integrating new information. This is how worldviews evolve, transforming normative frameworks of meaning to adapt to new circumstances and information. And since the overall direction of evolution is towards more optimal flows of energy and informational complexity, worldviews of Culture tend to complexify just as Life and Mind complexify.
>
> That is the macro-scale picture of Symbolic Learning—the complexification of cultural meanings, which impinge upon and influence justificatory contexts below it, all the way down to the micro-scale of the individual, whose ego takes shape through enculturation into that shared worldview of the group. At this level, Symbolic Learning is an ontogenetic process, unfolding through individual adaptive interactions with the environment. Here, despite language’s inherently collectivizing nature, meaning is still individual, concerned with the viability of the person in context. As the “unit” of Culture, the ego learns to meaningfully navigate its world to achieve its normative goals as a multilayered entity very, very far from equilibrium.
>
> The focus of the remainder of this book series will be the transformation of human meaning systems through Symbolic Learning. Given the inherently transpersonal nature of the linguistic medium through which it operates, this will require looking at both micro and macro scales—that is, the ontogenetic learning done by individuals and the phylogenetic learning done by the species through cultural evolution. Through ontogenetic learning, individuals generate their own, slightly different world models. Through justification dynamics, individual decision-making and reasoning based on these world models become subject to public scrutiny and winnowed through the selection mechanisms of Symbolic Learning. In this way, human collectives learn to “think together,” cohering collective justification systems through the integration of mental information processed by its members. Individuals feed symbolic information to the collective and the collective rears individuals by means of established symbolic information. That is what enculturation is. Through this process, mediated through individual learning, worldviews develop and human meaning evolves." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Along the way, meaningful concerns and behaviors proliferated. Beginning as a purely thermodynamic imperative to materially persist, meaning deepened into complex organisms’ goal-directed behavior of energy capture, self-maintenance, and reproduction; then infinitely diversified through an explosion of mobile animals normatively navigating a vast possibility space by means of increasingly complex mental models. All this eventually gave rise to (and plays out within) an inner world of subjective experience, wherein normative values became felt as qualia states for a persisting experiential self—which in time led to social selves in group dynamics sensitive to complex social relationships of all sorts.
>
> From a secure, naturalistic foundation of meaning in thermodynamic principles, we have thus been able to build up successively more complex layers spanning multiple novel information processing systems which are dependent upon (but not reducible to) the substrates from which they arise. By the time we reach the Culture level of human meaning, there is a rich tapestry of various semantic registers interweaving symbolic, social, experiential, genetic, and other sources of meaningful information. Underpinning them all, however, is the same basic teleological and thus normative endeavor of successfully persisting and enhancing viability...
>
> ...
>
> What all of this ultimately offers us is a robust theorization of human meaning and value, and a framework for understanding how and why these emerge and change. It allows us to see how 1) meaning in human culture constitutes a dynamic system of semantic information processing at multiple levels, linking the human person to material, biological, neuronal, and cultural realities; 2) these meanings play out in context, in response to specific conditions that characterize the entity–field relationship; 3) these meanings are subject to the continual revision of an ongoing learning process, whereby new information reduces uncertainty and reshapes beliefs and values." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "But humans do pass, and the patterned information of the infinite richness of their egos is experienced no more by those they leave behind. Death is thus bitterest for the most complex beings, who have the depth of consciousness to taste the nuanced flavors of its bitterness. Death is “the last enemy,” but also “the mother of beauty.”" - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "Complex entities strive to update their world models through learning, which provides them the relevant information they need to orient their actions towards optimal goal states. As they do, meaningful knowledge is attained that permits the achievement of still greater levels of complexity, and so on. This process plays out in human culture through the development of symbolic meaning-sharing, which is a form of semantic information processing able to intersubjectively cohere large groups of individuals in a symbolic world dedicated to achieving collective goals.
>
> As meaningful knowledge is learned by people in societies, it is symbolically translated and culturally affirmed, whereupon it serves to in-form future action and collective organization. A “sense for meaning” is thus cultivated among a society’s members, a honing of predictive accuracy in the direction established by earlier successes, as new information is continually compared against the proven templates of a society’s established meanings. Language allows these established meanings to be reified and reflected upon, and through collective cultural memory these meanings are stored and transmitted to new generations across time via the enculturation process discussed above.
>
> ...
>
> “The sacred,” then, can be understood as both the symbolic repository of a culture’s most proven meanings and values as well as the informing template or ideal by means of which people assess novel information for meaning. Cultural memory serves, you could say, as a transpersonally aggregated world model by means of which enculturated individuals learn to predict meaning. Embodied predictive processing of cultural meaning with the greatest causal power manifests as intuitions of sacredness.
>
> Over time, such collective learning carves out a hierarchy of values relative to the specific environmental conditions of the society. Like the formation of a neural network, the most successful meanings and values become well-trodden and robust, and get deposited into the symbolic social repository as sacred beliefs. The less established, exploratory pathways remain weak, and could as easily lead to failure as to new, more successful beliefs. Symbolic Learning is the process by which cultures update their collective world models towards more viable beliefs, in the course of which the sacred itself is updated. Because the sacred is both what is updated as well as the guide to more robust meaning, there is both disruption and continuity in this learning process. The sacred does not just change, it develops...
>
> I will use the word “sacred,” then, to refer to those collective representations of a culture that are superlatively meaningful to it (in the technical sense of meaning as mutual information with causal power bearing on viability). The sacred constitutes the veritable foundation upon which psycho-cultural flourishing depends. It hallows that which sustains and upholds a given society, enshrining the established gains of cognition and conception that make any continued gains possible. It is the proper respect owed to the adaptive path taken, its active shoring up, and the intimation of where it will lead based on where it has been. It is, in short, what is deemed most important to the continued viability of a successful human system–environment relationship.
>
> One glimpses this sense even in colloquial uses of the word, as the “sacred” has been extended beyond traditional religious discourse into other domains of cultural significance. A cathedral or mosque are readily admitted as “sacred” spaces for religious practitioners, of course, but a secular nation’s capitol and its seat of democratic governance is also said to be “sacred.” Human rights and freedoms are likewise “sacred” in this modern sense. But so, too, is a tribe’s totem or initiation rite “sacred” to its members. For those sensitive to ecology and the dynamic systems that render all life possible, Nature and the biosphere are held as “sacred.”
>
> When threatened or attacked, these sites of the sacred will be adamantly defended by their acolytes like white blood cells warding off disease. That is because, without the sacred, the psycho-social superorganism would break down. A tribe depends on its totems, religious communities on their Gods, modern secular nation states on their democratic ideals and institutions, etc. They are what ground and orient such societies at their varying levels of size and complexity. They are what keep them from entropic dissolution as well as what propel them towards still greater integrity and scope.
>
> As meaningful information, the sacred also complexifies through Symbolic Learning. In fact, its informational richness increases in tandem with the society’s causal power, as it both permits and demands greater energetic input to sustain itself in the face of entropic dissolution. In this sense, the sacred itself is a kind of dissipative structure, a self-organizing informational configuration far from equilibrium in continual exchange with the environment. One might call this a thermodynamic theory of the sacred. Like all dissipative structures, the sacred complexifies by means of learning, and on the plane of Culture, this learning is accomplished by individual members of society.
>
> As human minds complexify through learning, allowing more information to be related and coordinated, meaningful knowledge increases and the comprehensive scope and coherence of the sacred expands accordingly. The world model extends its horizons; the causal connections between phenomena grow more refined; the profundity of explanatory patterns deepens; the resolution of thought becomes sharper, more nuanced, more fine-grained. Entirely new superlatives of normativity come into view. What is best, highest, greatest, most important, most true, most real are articulated with more clarity and inclusivity. In the process, the prevailing sense of the ultimate becomes successively contingent relative to something more ultimate still, and the sacred outgrows itself.
>
> Given how important and, indeed, meaningful this process is, we may wish to appreciate the learning process itself as sacred—or (because it is what gives rise to sacred content) perhaps even as a sort of meta-sacred phenomenon. Learning is the means by which the sacred emerges and develops. After all, it is particularly in moments of breakthrough, of transcendence, of insight, that the sacred is experientially encountered. This is how new depths of meaning get disclosed. Such instances of adaptive learning mark advances into the unknown—a relatively chaotic realm of possibility whose increased entropy does not ultimately disrupt coherence but actually enhances it by the disclosure of still greater structure operating with greater degrees of freedom. But that, you will note, is what complexification is. We might suggest, then, that learning is the archetypal act of transcendence. It is what complexifies the mind, permitting an updating of the world model according to which cultural meaning is (re)assessed.
>
> This meta-sacred act transcends any contextual sacred (e.g., a totem, a church, etc.) for it is the very pattern by which the sacred manifests and develops. Indeed, it is perhaps only because every instance of the sacred is itself a product of this general process that instances of the sacred can serve as a reliable canon by which to interpret novel information. As we shall see, aspects of this meta-sacred process wind up imprinted in specific sacred contents across the complexification process. Some things register as meaningful precisely because they gesture towards the meaning-developing process itself.
>
> We can thus appreciate that something deeper than the sacred underlies the development of the sacred—something more important than any local realization of importance. Predictive processing models of cognition may be indicative of this, as they suggest that it is updating our sense of meaning that is actually most meaningful to us. We operate off of prior information to make predictions, and if that information proves reliable, it is meaningful for us in the sense of maintaining our viability. But successful predictions are boring—by design. All is going very well viability-wise if we experience very little surprise. It means the model is holding. By contrast, it is when we are confronted by new information which may stand to profoundly upgrade the quality of our priors that we become engrossed, transfixed, curious, amazed. As we will see, awe is itself a product of the learning process, a state of wonder aroused by the attempt to integrate a surplus of potentially meaningful information.
>
> The experience of meaning as profound relevance, as salience, as significance—this arises not so much from any established sacred per se, but from the meta-sacred call to learn, to complexify, to transcend, and update one’s conception of the sacred thereby. New forms of the sacred always lie on the other side of awe. Awe is the meta-sacred response to information we have not yet processed for its sacrality. It is the mind’s reflex before the invitation to transcendence. It is the liminal state beyond one’s old concept of the sacred and before a new one. It is the blissful open receptivity to an upgrade for one’s meaning-making. It is the condition in which one meets such benevolent chaos as reorganizes you for the better—an incomprehensible fullness appreciated by the mystics as the Mystery. All learning strives to render it known, and all learning ultimately falls short. What it produces is a series of “ultimates” progressively approximating more and more of that abyss of meaning. These are the faces of God as they get redrawn through the advances in Symbolic Learning.
>
> The evolution of meaning has thus been characterized by a succession of increasingly comprehensive and complex articulations of the sacred, to which human minds have transcended by reaching ever higher levels of informational integration and hierarchical coordination. Like other informational structures moving further from equilibrium, the configurational organization of the sacred has undergone a series of phase shifts across human cultural history, a punctuated equilibrium of different states reaching new degrees of complexity as more energy enters the system and organizes what it flows through. The substrate of this complex adaptive system is not some tangible solid or liquid, but the psycho-cultural system of information processing known as human society itself. The attractors to which it is drawn therefore correlate to the ways human minds learn to process symbolic information at higher levels of complexity. Meaning and the sacred emerge and evolve out of the learning mind’s distinct Umwelts as it progressively renders more of the Mystery known.
>
> ...
>
> As we shall see, though, a word like “God” is probably better reserved in reference to a particular cultural Umwelt’s conception of the sacred. “God,” at least as an anthropomorphic, supernatural being, is but one shape assumed by the sacred in cultural history, a moment in the complexification of meaning. However, those who use the word “God” to refer to more abstract notions, such as Paul Tillich’s “ultimate concern,” would be employing the term more as I am using “the sacred.” I myself will sometimes speak of God in this way: not as any given moment in the evolution of the sacred, but as the enduring entity being evolved." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "[65] For a useful introduction, see Thomas Parr, Giovanni Pezzulo, and Karl Friston, Active Inference: The Free Energy Principle in Mind, Brain, and Behavior (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2022). They summarize the notion of Active Inference as a goal-directed learning process that continually updates an entity’s world model in response to how well it predicts (infers) future states. Accurate models allow organisms to predict with high probability the state of their environment, whereas inaccurate models will meet with surprise when expectations don’t match reality, occasioning an update to the model. Through this process, the entity learns more and more about its surroundings. They write:
>
> 'Active Inference is a normative framework to characterize Bayes-optimal behavior and cognition in living organisms. Its normative character is evinced in the idea that all facets of behavior and cognition in living organisms follow a unique imperative: minimizing the surprise of their sensory observations. Surprise is to be interpreted in a technical sense: it measures how much an agent’s current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations—that is, those that preserve its integrity (e.g., for a fish, being in the water). Importantly, minimizing surprise is not something that can be done by passively observing the environment: rather, agents must adaptively control their action-perception loops to solicit desired sensory observations. This is the active bit of Active Inference. (6)'
>
> Or, more simply: “Surprise minimization permits living organisms to (temporarily) resist the second law of thermodynamics” (47).
>
> As a theory of animal cognition, Active Inference extends into the domain of Mind the same sort of dynamics we have been tracking across the lower levels of cosmic complexification. The basic entity–field relationship creates a thermodynamic imperative from the start, setting off a cascade of increasing free energy dissipation, structural organization, and information generation characterizing a universal learning process that grows more sophisticated from Matter to Life to Mind and beyond. At every level, there is meaning owing to the intrinsic desire of entities to extend their existence. So, too, at the level of Cognitive Learning, “Active Inference…is purposive and teleological” (57), a “normative,” goal-driven process relating entities and environments in a field of value." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "[78] The sorts of minded animals that occupy the complexity plane Mind, then, can be divided into unconscious and conscious categories. Henriques refers to the cognitive apparatus related to the former as Mind1 and the latter as Mind2. Purely reflex-based reaction cognition describes the workings of Mind1. This kind of cognition can occur without any subjective consciousness, the way your body is currently pumping blood through your arteries and regulating your breathing and other vital functions without any conscious awareness or intention on your part. The nervous system simply takes in information, processes it, and generates a suitable output behavior in response in line with its teleological, homeo-static goal-states far from equilibrium. Even without any conscious awareness, let alone linguistic-conceptual knowledge, Mind1 identifies the information that is relevant for the functioning of the animal and hones its reflexive responses in a meaningful way. As Henriques summarizes it:
>
> 'One way to conceive of cognition…in functional terms is that it is the semantic meaning the neurocognitive system generates to frame the animal–environment relation and identify what is relevant in the landscape of affordances that might guide its path of behavioral investment. (A New Synthesis, 291-292)'
>
> Mind2, by contrast, exhibits subjective conscious experience (SCE), wherein those semantic meanings are integrated and coordinated. Survey-ing a broad literature on the evolution and nature of consciousness, Henriques summarizes:
>
> ''SCE is likely not present in the reacting, reflexive, fixed action level of animal mentation, such as seen in a sea slug. The argument here is that the beginnings of SCE emerge with the learning level, such that pleasure and pain can be thought of as nature’s first qualia that integrate and coordinate flexible learning patterns based on association and consequence. These ‘mental flashes’ model the animal–environment relationship and orient approach or avoidance behaviors.

> For further consideration of the sacred as the basis of “world formation,” see William E. Paden, Religious Worlds: The Comparative Study of Religion, 2nd ed. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994) As the organizing framework for his comparative analysis, Paden writes: “Religions create, maintain, and oppose worlds. Their mythic symbols declare what the world is based on, what its oppositional forces are, what hidden worlds lie beyond or within ordinary life. …It is of the very essence of religion to interpret the world” (53-54). Simply put, “the sacred is the foundation of a world” (61). The sacred world carves out an intelligible sphere for human activity that enshrines moral knowledge and collective values as teleological lodestars for guiding the behavior of its members. The individual “downloads” the worldview of their culture as part of ego development, whereby the telos of the individual and the collective become shared." - [A Universal Learning Process, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216232048-a-universal-learning-process)

> "[119] This insight allows us to appreciate the truths contained in Émile Durkheim’s seminal sociological reading of the sacred—namely, as the enshrinement of the transpersonal force facilitating social cohesion and generative integration of the collective. In worshipping the shared sacred object of reverence (be it totem, spirit, god, what have you), humans are actually renewing society itself: the superorganism (we might say) sustaining and preserving every individual as parts within the whole.>
> In his classic 1912 work The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, Durkheim posits:
>
> 'We can say, in fact, that the worshipper is not deluding himself when he believes in the existence of a higher power from which he derives his best self: that power exists, and it is society. When the Australian is transported beyond himself and feels life flowing in him with an intensity that surprises him, he is not prey to illusion. That exaltation is real, and it is really the product of forces external and superior to the individual. Of course he is mistaken when he believes that this heightened vitality is the work of a power that takes plant or animal form. But his error lies only in taking literally the symbol that represents this being to men’s minds, or the form of its existence. Behind these figures and metaphors, crude or refined, there is a concrete and living reality. Religion takes on a meaning and a logic that the most intransigent rationalist cannot fail to recognize. The main purpose of religion is not to provide a representation of the natural world… [R]eligion is above all a system of notions by which individuals imagine the society to which they belong and their obscure yet intimate relations with that society. This is its primordial role; and although this representation is metaphorical and symbolic, it is not inaccurate. Quite the contrary, it fully expresses the most essential aspect of the relations between the individual and society. For it is an eternal truth that something exists outside of us that is greater than we are, and with which we commune. ​That is why we can be sure that acts of worship, whatever they might be, are not futile or meaningless gestures. By seeming to strengthen the ties between the worshipper and his god, they really strengthen the ties that bind the individual to his society, since god is merely the symbolic expression of society. (Émile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 170-171)'

As noted above, the inherently interconnected nature of a complex universe means that information across all levels interweave and influence my existence (and my survival) in ways that would give me greater causal power if I could more accurately conceptualize them. Knowing, then, how “it all fits together” or “what it’s all about” to contextualize all the contexts I can imagine would indeed be of great utility and value.
>
> It is, I believe, the valued goal-state of attaining such a big picture perspective that informs our normative quest for not just meaning in life (which is always contextually given by our local transjective relationship dynamics) but a sense of meaning to life (which places all such local meanings in a broader global frame and thus serves as a meta-normative guide). Such, I believe, is the function of so-called “meta-narratives,” which make meaning of our meanings by placing all knowledge within a grand teleological frame.
>
> As we shall see, however, no metanarrative is ever actually complete. All represent moments in the collective human learning process. As such, each retains its own conception of the sacred, which both coheres its gains and drives its expansion into the unknown.

The Left works only to maintain the welfare state, the Greens to maintain the sustainability of our current civilization, the libertarian Right to boost economic growth and the nationalist or conservative Right seeks to maintain the old nation state in the face of immigration and globalization. All of these movements and ideologies are stuck in the mindset of party politics that evolved from industrial society, with its classes and issues. None of them actually offer us anything new, or anything that might substantially improve our lives in a way that would compare to the building of the modern liberal democracy with a market economy and welfare state. What is the equivalent of this system in the society of the future, a society we know is globalized, digitalized and postindustrial? In which direction can and should our society evolve? Is that an unreasonable question? I don’t think it is. I think it’s deeply unsettling that we, as humanity, are not having that conversation.

We will have different ideas about the world and our place in it. Just being alive will feel different.

We are not talking about shoving some formula for the good life down everybody’s throat. We’re talking about creating likelihoods for good conditions.

> Here’s a rough diagnosis to start from. What we think of as “normal life” is simply too harsh and cruel on our psyches, too demanding and full of insoluble dilemmas. We thereby, from childhood and onwards, become mutilated versions of our fuller potentials. Because of these many wounds, scars and arrested developments, we fail to become truly kind, intelligent an open-minded. On a subtle level we fear the world; we expend energy protecting ourselves, and this means that we fail to awaken in ourselves the playful curiosity and love that are needed for us to comprehend and respond to the challenges of the world. We make poor decisions for how to live our lives, what to prioritize, what to care about, and what to produce and consume. And we hold ourselves and each other back." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Nasty whirlwinds of feedback cycles blow through this great multidimensional web, pulsating with hurt and degradation. My lacking human development blocks your possible human development. My lack of understanding of you, your needs and perspectives, hurts you in a million subtle ways. I become a bad lover, a bad colleague, a bad fellow citizen and human being. We are interconnected: You cannot get away from my hurt and wounds. They will follow you all of your life—I will be your daughter’s abusive boyfriend, your belligerent neighbor from hell. And you will never grow wings, because there will always be mean bosses, misunderstanding families and envious friends. And you will tell yourself that is how life must be.

> But it is not how life has to be. Once you begin to be able to see the social-psychological fabric of everyday life, it becomes increasingly apparent that the fabric is relatively easy to change, to develop. Metamodern politics aims to make everyone secure at the deepest psychological level, so that we can live authentically; a byproduct of which is a sense of meaning in life and lasting happiness; a byproduct of which is kindness and an increased ability to cooperate with others; a byproduct of which is deeper freedom and better concrete results in the lives of everyone; a byproduct of which is a society less likely to collapse into a heap of atrocities.

> We desperately need a deeper kind of welfare, beyond the confines of material welfare and medical security—a listening society, where every person is seen and heard (rather than made invisible and then put under surveillance). How can this be achieved?" - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "At the dawn of the modern age Adam Smith, the father of economics, warned us about the “man of system” who tries to arrange everything in accordance to his plans and ideas about the good society, but ends up creating unexpected consequences and misuses of political power:
>
> “…so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it.”[34]
>
> You may have heard of the term “nudging”, Sunstein and Thaler’s behavioral-economic idea that people can be subtly “nudged” to make “better” choices by means of “libertarian paternalism”. A “choice architect” can arrange how food is presented in the school’s lunch line, thereby improving public health by facilitating the making of “better” choices.[35]
>
> There is nothing wrong with this line of reasoning in principle—but it begs the question about who such a “choice architect” should reasonably be. In Sunstein and Thaler’s discussion, the “choice architect” comes eerily close to “the man of system”. At the very least, people should get to vote in a “direct democracy” manner, about how or when we want to nudged or not.
>
> Every day we must look deep into our own eyes in the mirror—are we becoming this technocratic man of system? This is not only a contemplative question, but a political and analytical one. As you will see in the next book, the six new forms of politics suggested create checks and balances that work against the misuse of power, against manipulation and insensitive social engineering. The development of society and our increasing knowledge force us to face, and to balance out, the man of the system at new and deeper levels. We have only begun to become acquainted with this “man of system”—and this grey eminence will show his face in more subtle ways, even deep within ourselves." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "We know that the costs of one kid gone rebel in the rich world are immense, seen over a life span: not entering the labor market, taking up social costs, police work, courts and prison, causing harm to other citizens, reducing general security and causing surveillance and security costs to rise, making the public afraid and thereby more prone to dumb fear-driven politics, and so on. Lately economists and social work researchers have increasingly argued that such “bad kids” should be singled out early on and get the extra support they need; a few years of support teacher salary is a bargain in comparison.
>
> That is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about something of a much greater magnitude (and ethically on less murky waters) than singling out 4-year old ruffians. We are talking about universal measures, guaranteeing everyone more care, support and attention by redesigning all of our major institutions to improve the quality of human relations, personal development and mental health.

> ...

> The most reasonable answer is that, on average, society as a whole would be safer, saner and kinder—and that these effects would accumulate over decades and generations until a new and higher equilibrium of happiness and lower suffering is reached. People would experience a much higher degree of freedom and contentment. Life would be a lot more fun and exciting too, since much fewer people would get stuck in their lives, limited in their development by stress, anxieties or broken relationships. There would be more human bonds, trust and opportunities. This in turn would save humongous costs and let much more people spend their lifetimes in productive service of themselves and others. So the whole idea of a listening society is possible because, after its initial investments, it saves a lot more than it spends. It saves the increasingly pressured welfare system.
>
> I will say it again, in case you missed it, because people really seem to have difficulties with getting this point. 
>
> • The listening society saves the welfare system, by being much more efficient and socially sustainable than our current system, thereby being more affordable in the long run.  
>
> What we are talking about is the deliberate, long-term management of deep, complex, social-psychological issues. These deeply seated issues affect all aspects of society in a great variety of ways that are difficult to predict precisely. But the effects are pretty easy to spot on a general level. Think about it—if the average person would just be more socially well-developed, healthier and kinder, would not society as a whole benefit immensely? How about the economy, the labor market, or the efficiency of democratic governance?
>
> A deeper welfare, a listening society, is possible because we live in a postindustrial age and because we are now beginning to have the knowledge to execute it successfully; new social technologies are being made available. And the knowledge about how to continuously improve upon the implementation of such social technologies is growing.

> By offering a bid for a “Green Social Liberalism 2.0”, one begins to build a new layer of society, on top of the modern society and its project of progress and enlightenment. It brings up deeper, more personal and authentic issues that constitute the very core of how society functions. Such social-psychological and existential issues are often what lie under the surface of superficial “societal problems” that we habitually think about and debate.
>
> More and more people have begun to take interest in asking deeper questions about life and society. People long for more depth and authenticity—and the inspiration that can come from answers in these domains. There is a demand for a deeper kind of politics, and thus there is political power for the taking. This new layer of welfare breaks the limits of modern society. It begins to transform the very quality of human relations. Nobody else is doing it, so whoever starts first gains a sharp competitive edge. That’s what makes it possible.
>
> And, Yes, It Is Necessary
>
> But Green Social Liberalism 2.0, and the listening society that it seeks to put into effect, are not just long-shot possibilities. They are, as I have argued, a moral imperative. And they constitute an institutional necessity. We are quickly moving from one kind of society to another, and failure to adopt a more efficient welfare system is likely to have very negative consequences. Our current form of liberal democracy and welfare deserve all the respect in the world—but they are insufficient, and we must help them evolve. If we do not, our society can be expected to face increasing problems, even to the point of collapse, as our old answers and institutions persistently fail to tackle the challenges brought by the new era.
>
> ... What is lacking in our day and age is the ability for people to manage complex problems that require patience, knowledge, oversight, creativity, mutual trust and friendly co-operation across sectors, scientific disciplines, cultures and subcultures. In a phrase: the management of complexity. Or, with a term we shall get back to, we require greater collective intelligence.
>
> Similar social-psychological demands are also increasing for everyday choices such as consumption and how we spend our time amidst all the distractions. It even holds for personal relations, where new forms of love, family, friendships, acquaintances, co-habitation and mixed work-personal relations are mushrooming all over the world. We need people who are much more socially and psychologically functional for this new society to run smoothly in all of its crazed beauty. As a population, we are not ready to face up to and live in the society that we ourselves have created. We are out of our depth. Or, as Robert Kegan—the Harvard adult development psychologist—has suggested, we are in over our heads.
>
> ...
>
> It is a major challenge for people to stay sane in this world full of contradictions, temptations, distractions and stressful yet devilishly vague demands. No meaningful story is given beforehand (unless you are part of some religious sect, but even these positions are increasingly precarious). Not only must we stay sane; we must find and keep direction in all of this; we must stay active, even as our activities are rarely “necessary” in any direct, concrete sense...
>
> ...
>
> ... many new professional roles need to be invented to match the transformations of labor, as robotization and digitalization progress. “New jobs must be created”, to speak that horrid language of our current leadership. Many of these jobs can and should be concerned with the meaningful activities involved in creating a listening society (a huge amount of work is needed helping kids, designing public spaces, supporting life stage transitions, improving upon diet, organizing citizen deliberation, evaluating and developing all of the above, and so forth). So the listening society is necessary both as support to the citizen and as a new source of meaningful, productive work opportunities.
>
> Moreover, the listening society is necessary as a competitive edge in the global economy. The regions that will be able to create the most fertile soil for the blooming of human relations and wellbeing, are also likely to have much higher productivity in the postindustrial economy. It is well established that things such as flow state and intrinsic motivation are conductive to creativity and performance of complex tasks. Confident, happy people, who can manage more abstract and long-term goals, and who are more self-secure and thus better at taking in negative feedback (and adjusting to new information), will simply outcompete other people in the scramble for capital and central positions in the new world economy.
>
> This is a cynical part of the argument, admittedly, but an important one. It is not just that the listening society is kinder and more ethical. The listening society is, plainly, much more powerful in a digitalized global economy, than is the capitalist liberal democracy. It saves so much tax money, it boosts enterprise, entrepreneurship and innovation, it attracts talent, and it attracts capital in different forms—and it grows human and social capital. We have seen similar macroeconomic effects with HDI-rankings (Human Development Index): human development drives economic growth." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The point of meditation in schools is of course not to inspire woo-woo beliefs or anything of the sort, but to improve people’s lives and society at large. It’s not a matter of turning kids and citizens into quiet, complacent little Buddha statues, but a matter of psychological and cultural development.
>
> It works through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is that people learn the skill of self-awareness, calming their own minds and not overreacting. That is of course useful in all walks of life. The second mechanism—and perhaps the more important one—is that it changes your mental and emotional state then and there. So if the average kid spends an average of fifteen minutes being guided in calming her own mind every day, she will be a little less anxious and aggressive that same day. Hence, on average, she can be expected to treat her friends and rival twelve-year-olds a little better during lunch break. Now imagine that it is not only her, but her full class of 35 people ... who all get this subtle nudge. Would not the whole social climate be somewhat softer and kinder, a little less tense and stressed? And now imagine that this goes on for 12 years. Do you imagine there might be an accumulation? During that time, her school experience teaches her a lot about what to expect from life. Will the social processes by which she makes friends, handles conflicts, learns who to trust have been affected? Will it affect how much she feels she can trust people, how much disdain she should have for the boys, how much time she will have spent intriguing instead of studying? Will she know herself a little better?
>
> ...
>
> Now, even if we don’t yet have the major studies about cumulative effects on groups that stack up over time, it should be obvious that there is an interesting field here. How much disease, suffering, depression, criminality and social misery could we prevent? Probably a lot. 
>
> The costs are extremely low and the effects quite wide-reaching. What would happen if we had serious, scientifically driven meditation teachers designing the best possible programs for schools? Probably a lot. Now ask yourself what would be the effect if millions of people had twelve years of this kind of training and then interact in society. Would there be changes to the overall patterns of such a society? Would the effects stack up over generations—what if your grandmother, your dad and you all get to grow up in a somewhat more emotionally nourishing environment? Would that affect your life? Probably a lot. 
>
> I have friends who study meditation in schools and other institutions from a more critical perspective. Meditation is certainly no magic bullet. You have to consider the social-psychological aspects: What happens if somebody feels pressured to meditate in a situation where they are not comfortable? Or when someone gets frustrated because the others seem to experience it as more pleasant than oneself? And sometimes, it has been shown, meditation seems to cause anxieties rather than reduce them. 
>
> All of this is not different from, say, gym class: In Sweden alone 30 000 kids are treated in hospitals each year from physical injuries in school (and another 60 000 from spare time sports injuries). That doesn’t mean sports are bad. And mathematics causes a lot of anxieties and frustrations—but it doesn’t mean that it should be excluded from education or society at large. It just means that there are problems we should be aware of and deal with as we go along.
>
> ... we as a society have not yet developed to a stage where these deeper issues—issues that affect all aspects of life and society—are part of our general social, economic and political awareness. In terms of money, such long-term investment, if properly supported by science, can be extremely cost effective. And yes, it can boost the economy, as the average person gains more trust, better social relations and becomes happier.

Either people get angry because you are suggesting that the future might be good, or they get mad because you suggest that society today is bad.

> What, then, is the way out of this grid-lock? Fundamentally, it is a matter of understanding that society is both very, very good and simultaneously very, very bad. Reality is rich. It has room for plenty of extremes. It has multitudes of contradictions. We must increasingly learn to live and deal with such paradoxes.

> "Another example of transpartisanism. During the increasing pressures of migration, party leader Uffe Elbæk wrote an open letter in the paper, kindly asking the center-right prime minister (who is rather restrictive on immigration) for a dialogue on how to avoid bitter polarization of the Danish public on this hot topic. So what are the dogmas of debate? There are six of them, renamed “debate principles” on their English homepage:
>
> • We will openly discuss both the advantages and the disadvantages of a certain argument or line of action.
>
> • We will listen more than we speak, and we will meet our political opponents on their own ground.
>
> • We will emphasize the core set of values that guide our arguments.
>
> • We will acknowledge when we have no answer to a question or when we make mistakes.
>
> • We will be curious about each and every person with whom we are debating.
>
> • We will argue openly and factually as to how The Alternative’s political vision can be realized.
>
> As voters, many of us often recognize that we cannot know the answers to all the complicated societal questions. And frankly, neither can the politicians reasonably be expected to. But what we can know with some reliability is that if politicians are more humble in their opinions—and more open to new information and thereby more intelligent in their dialogue and debate with others—we are likely to get more balanced and sound politics.
>
> And we can know that the process oriented party vouches for a better dialogue, thereby improving the climate for discussion and deliberation throughout the political realm, not just within that particular party, but within and between all parties. Hence, this approach speaks to the tendency of the electorate to be increasingly disenchanted with the ongoing debates in postindustrial party politics. It targets a deep nerve within the population of a liberal democracy, where the Left and Right no longer represent clearly defined class interests, and people long for a more honest and nuanced discussion.

> We are here approaching one of the strange paradoxes of our time, one of the many cases where a both-and thinking is required. The paradox is this: We need to simultaneously deal with increasingly clear and well-defined hierarchies, and we need society to become more democratic and inclusive.
>
> The people who end up on top in this strange new hierarchy are the most democratic ones—the people who have the personalities, skills and cultural codes necessary to create social settings that are more inclusive and nuanced. Such social settings can handle contradicting views, allow for more autonomy and experimentation, and can handle a greater number of relationships with fewer conflicts.

> "Issues such as universal freedom of migration, international security, terrorism, internet policing, climate crisis, ecological sustainability, stabilizing international finance and banking, global poverty, basic material security, basic income, labor rights, human and animal rights all share one fundamental trait: they are transnational by nature. They all function through borders and beyond nations. You are probably familiar with these issues as being different versions of “prisoners’ dilemma games”, where nation states are pitched against one another and all end up losing unless they manage the risk that mutual cooperation necessarily entails.
>
> In the long run, we know that the nation state cannot remain the primary, or at least not the hegemonic, building block of our governance and self-organization. There are two simple reasons for this. The first is that we are increasingly facing problems that are not solvable at the national level. The second is that there are a growing number of “societies” that don’t correspond to nation state constructs, such as dynamic economic regions built around major transnational cities—with growing, influential and successful populations who lead lives beyond nation state identities and national legislative or symbolic frameworks. Basically, there are a growing lot of issues and people and cities that just don’t fit into the nation state.
>
> The state can remain, of course, as a kind of administrative and democratic “train station” in a larger meshwork of governance: local, regional, city-based, corporate, continental, digital and global. In other words, the long-term attractor (the point we are likely to approach) is some kind of more intricate meshwork of governance structures and institutions. There are other forms of governance that are beginning to work beyond states—supranational institutions, administrations of strong city regions (often more in tune with the day and age than national parliaments), corporate structures and NGOs. It is true that nation states still control the armies, but warfare is becoming less central to political reality—even if militaristic relapses of geopolitics and wars are unavoidable.
>
> To be clear, the transnational way of thinking first of all means that “metamodernists know no borders”, that the ethics and values are world-centric, or perhaps cosmo-centric. It also means that you have a general way of thinking where the nation state or region are not the primary categories of society, but rather just tools or train stations in a longer journey of the historical development of governance, of human self-organization.
>
> This also means that you refrain from over-essentializing nationalities and ethnicities. Frenchness, Chineseness, Arabicness, the Nordic ideology, the German ideology—it’s all nonsense; just temporary, contingent patterns, cutting through water. The cultures evolve; the forms of governance, languages and economies continuously transmute. National cultures are what Irish-American anthropologist Benedict Anderson called “imagined communities”, continuously being reimagined. They are based on what Norwegian anthropologist Fredrik Barth called “ethnic boundary making”: I am German because I am not Danish, and so forth." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The metamodern aristocracy doesn’t work according to a linear plan about what will come (like those damned communists). They just share some common conceptual maps, personal traits, perspectives and political sentiments. This makes them difficult to spot with the naked eye. They are a loose network of people who recognize each other and who share some common overarching perspectives. They work together in a myriad of different ways—lending resources and support for the development of ideas, arranging key events, starting businesses and other organizations or projects, and affecting policy making.

To educate and to seduce—these two words come from the same Latin root.

They don’t press their agenda on others, but they tickle the dialectic processes to see what emerges, having strong intuitions about in which directions it might go. Often, this is done through art and cultural expression, hinting at new perspectives and potentials. Just by breathing the same air, the fresh air of a potential—but not predetermined—future society.

> "The French philosopher Deleuze proposes that we should see society as made up by dividuals, i.e. that we all are in fact part of one another and affect one another. We consist of many different influences, roles and perspectives, within a multitude of contexts.
>
> I am offering a related bid for anti-individualism: the transpersonal perspective. The transpersonal perspective holds two seemingly opposed, but in reality complementary, positions. 
>
> The first position is to see society as determined by the deep, inner lives—the most personal relations and tender emotions—of human beings. This takes the unique lived experience of each human being very seriously. Such lived experience is taken to be the very foundation of society: if there is anger or love in our hearts, if there is peace in our minds, and if all manner of psychological issues have been properly dealt with. Such things determine if we turn out engaged world citizens, mindless consumers or bitter reactionaries.
>
> The second position is that this deeply human and personal experience is in turn created by societal processes that are largely invisible to each single person, and accessible only through a profound and systematic sociological and psychological analysis of society.
>
> So this lands us in an apparent paradox: To really see the singular human being, to really respect her rights and uniqueness, we must go beyond the idea of the individual; we must see through it and strive to see how society is present within each single person as well as in the relationships through which she is born as a “self”. We go from the idea of the individual (vs. “the collective”), to simply seeing society as an evolving, interlinked set of transindividuals. This is the transpersonal perspective. It’s not just that we are each a billiard ball that “interacts” with other people. We co-emerge. Or, as the physicist-philosopher Karen Barad has put it: we intra-act.
>
> ...
>
> The idea of the listening society serves the transindividual: The human being is seen as more than a unique, separate life story. The idea of the transindividual sees the human being as inseparable from her language, her deep unconscious, her relations, roles, societal positions, values, emotions, developmental psychology, biological organism and so forth. Each human being is viewed as an open and social process, a whirlwind of participation and co-creation of society. Society as a whole is viewed as a self-organizing system which creates such transindividuals who are in turn able to recreate society.

Breivik, the mass murderer, was born in the school yard, in the dysfunctional family, in the peer group, on the internet, in the labor market, in failed love aspirations, in sexual frustrations, in failed masculinity (a recurring theme in his crazed “manifesto”, released the same day as the killings occurred—he even spent his last night with two expensive prostitutes and champagne), in hurt pride, in failed interethnic relations and stalling integration processes. In short, he was born as a result of the entire fabric of society.
>
> ... Think about it; the only way to have prevented this from occurring would be if people like Breivik were simply much less likely to emerge in the first place. We can’t really protect each single person from the ill will of all conceivable wrongdoers, not even with super-efficient policing. No matter how much we “stand up for the rights of the individual”, the individual will still be limited and harmed in a million ways, even to the point of being murdered, if we don’t see her deeper insides and the social-psychological contexts of which she is part—if we fail to see the transindividual and stand up for her rights.
>
> ... What we can do, however, is to make sure that the average person is happier and healthier, has better relationships, better self-knowledge and more support. Because the terrible truth is that Breivik is you and me. He is a direct result of the society we create and uphold every day. He is not an alien force. He is that kid from school who came back and killed our kids. It’s all interconnected. We are all interconnected. Obviously Breivik is an extreme example of social deviance, but he emerges in continuity with the rest of us. Somehow, we are made of the same stuff. The answer to the horror show that Breivik unleashed is to be found deep within ourselves.

> Let’s take another example, one from criminology and police research. In 1992, a British criminologist named Robert Reiner noted that there appears to be five interacting mechanisms that make the police direct more attention towards certain ethnic minorities:
>
> • Categorical discrimination, i.e. that the police themselves choose to stop and frisk more black people (or other minorities).
>
> • Transferred discrimination, i.e. that people in the general public call the police more often when they see black people around.
>
> • Interactional discretion, i.e. that the police have more cultural difficulties when it comes to interacting with certain groups and hence more often end up in situation that escalate to violence and arrest.
>
> • Institutionalized discrimination, i.e. that some areas with higher criminality are patrolled more and thus more people in these areas are put under surveillance.
>
> • Statistical discrimination, i.e. that the crime statistics of certain groups start bad cycles as the police direct their attention to these groups and hence reinforce the statistical overrepresentation of criminality within this group.
>
> Reiner contended that categorical discrimination—the one we generally think of when it comes to police racism—is the least powerful mechanism. In other words, Reiner was telling us that the rules of the game generated racism and discrimination (rather than the racism of the police officers themselves). In my own work on police ethnography, I have found plenty of reasons to believe that Reiner was right. With the view from complexity you see, again, that racism is an emergent pattern; a phenomenon that emerges not through the actions of individual people, but as a result of the interactions of many different people.
>
> ...
>
> The view from complexity may seem less exiting than images of a villainous patriarchy or the grim towers of capitalism. Somehow, it seems silly to gather in the hundreds and march down the street shouting: “Let’s develop our behaviors and slightly tweak the games of everyday life so that we, together, in the long run, produce dramatically better emergent properties!” There’s just not that oomph, not that “zing”. If you know what I mean.

> But here’s the deal. The more primitive and stupid your ideas about society, the cruder your “bad-guy theory” will be. To the Nazis, the bad-guys are the Jews, plain and simple. To the nationalist conservatives, the bad-guys are not necessarily Arabs, but certain problematic aspects of their culture and religion. To the modern libertarian, the bad-guys are laziness and lacking sense of responsibility—and all those pesky leftwing control freaks. To the Left it is capitalism. To the critical sociologist it is power structures. To the ecologist it is industrialism and a consumer society disconnected from the ecological systems.
>
> To the metamodernist, there are almost no bad-guys left, nobody and nothing to blame: not even an impersonal structure. With the view from complexity, there is only the painstaking tweaking of many small things that can help us fix the failures of our society and mitigate the tragedies of existence. Fighting the power structures and killing the Jews might be more exciting.

> "A large part of this issue is to transcend one’s own political allergies. Let’s try out a few words, allergies of the Left: market, power, capitalism, authority, profit—and of the Right: radical, social, feminism, revolution, public.

One needs to recognize that these are not inherent essences or givens. They can all be good or bad, depending on the context—and more pertinently, they are all good and bad. It just makes relatively little sense to “hate” or “be against” such vague and open categories as “the market”. It limits your thinking. It makes you dumb.

> All of these three systems—democratic bureaucracy, the market and civil sphere—are simply forms of governance that process information about the behavior of humans, coordinating our actions in order to create desirable common and individual results.

There are intelligent and unintelligent markets, intelligent and unintelligent bureaucracies and democratic institutions, and the civil sphere can be equally inclusive as it can be oppressive.

> "So you need to keep three stages in mind. One: markets, politics and personal relations are not clearly differentiated; two: in modern society these three spheres gain a great measure of independence from one another; three: in metamodern society, these three spheres are being re-integrated, ideally without any one of them dominating or contaminating the other two.
>
> Examples of this re-integration abound. Let’s mention just a few: Market mechanisms applied to public sector organization; planning of “triple helix models” for regional economic development (triple helix means collaborations between public, private and university agents in a region); an increasing pressure from civil sphere influence to break the alienating management and bureaucracy of both private corporations and the public sector; and personal relations within professional firms being increasingly honed and invested in. Again, this is a major process of our time. These examples are just a few superficial such changes visible in today’s society.
>
> The growing re-integration of these three different spheres of social life—the civic (politics, democracy, bureaucracy, public), the professional (market exchange) and the personal (the civil sphere, family life, communities)—requires of us a kind of political thought that does not take one of the dimensions as fundamental or inherently superior to the other two. We must see the totality of social and political life. This is what it means to go beyond Left and Right.
>
> ...
>
> But there really is an underpinning to all of this, a central insight. The philosophical principle of metamodern politics is as simple as it is elegant. This principle holds that social life is of fractal nature, and that society consists of three interdependent dimensions that always repeat themselves but ultimately depend on one another: solidarity, trade and competition.
>
> • Solidarity—in all societies that have ever existed, there has been cooperation and what the anarchist classic Peter Kropotkin termed “mutual aid”. And in all of our lives, there are always at least some aspects of such things as caring, brotherhood, friendship, cooperation, help, charity, alliances, affiliation, liking, love and so forth. The principle is: you, rather than me.
>
> • Trade—in all societies that have ever existed, and in everyone’s life, in every relationship, there is an element of exchange: tit for tat, something for something. The principle is: me and you, but only conditionally. “Only conditionally” serves to underscore that we only make trade transactions if there is something for us to gain.
>
> • Competition—in all societies that have ever existed, and in everyone’s life, in every goddamn relationship, there is an element of competition: conflicting interests, power relations, struggle, manipulations, violence, animosity, enmity and so on. The principle is: me, not you.
>
> The unstated, irrational belief that people have, is that one of these three dimensions somehow makes up a higher truth than the other two. The Left somehow believes, in a subtle but pervasive manner, that solidarity is the highest truth. The libertarian Right believes that trade is the first principle. The conservative and the fascist believe in their hearts that fierce competition lies beyond the other two, that it ultimately defines social reality.

> You can play the same game with another, related triad: equality, freedom and order. They sometimes work against one another, sometimes create synergies—but they cannot even exist without one another. If you love freedom, you must also see that, at its very core, freedom is born through order and equality, both of which in turn need freedom to exist. Higher degrees of order is often what allows for greater freedom—but only if the order is of a general and abstract form. Simply making people “organized” by having them march together, as in North Korea, hardly makes for a free society. Having functional policing, orderly statistics and revision of public finances, might." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "In reality, liberal democracy in industrial society has been a party-political trench war between working class (worker, employee) and bourgeois (industry, professional, consumer, share owner) interests. Industrial society, its classes and categories, has spliced aspects of us into different shards, from which political identities have been formed. From these different identities we could then form parties and belief systems about what modern life is and should be.
>
> Liberal democracy works as a power balance between these different aspects of ourselves, as a dialectical process resulting from the interaction of different ideas—ideas that by themselves are partial and largely mistaken, but that together form a dynamic process that we know as the liberal, democratic market economy with public welfare (leading up to Green Social Liberalism). It never actually worked through the “informed citizen” and certainly not the “public intellectual”. The ideological positions, Left and Right, were false all along. What we hailed as liberal democracy was never based on deliberation about the common good, but rather on the dialectic between conflicting interests, checked in a dynamic power balance.
>
> It is only when industrial society fully blooms into postindustrial society (and education levels rise dramatically and class distinctions and the categories of class become blurred), that liberal democracy begins to live up to its own mythos as a deliberation between equal citizens. In such societies we begin to observe a situation in which arguments and reasoning of informed citizens actually do matter. This is what pushes us towards “the Nordic ideology” and its more self-consciously deliberative co-development.
>
> It is a popular sentiment that democracy has lost its vitality these days. Political scientists in country after country show appalling research results—the younger generation would sell their votes, don’t care about democracy, and would even support dictators. But that democracy is losing ground is a superficial analysis, an illusion. Truth be told, democracy (as the rule of informed, deliberating citizens) is only becoming real once society develops past the trench wars of industrial class parties. Before that, we never had democracy in any deeper, qualitative sense anyway. The whole system was built around the fact that our interests were at odds. You couldn’t actually unite “the people” or “let the people rule”.

> "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Hierarchy 
>
> 1. Non-judgment. The first principle is that stages of development in humans and other organisms must be studied in the light of a radical acceptance, a pervasive non-judgment—much like Christianity (in its liberating forms) teaches, really...
>
> 2. Not a moral order. The second principle is that the developmental stages do not constitute a moral order, in which a higher or later stage would be morally “more worth” than a lower or earlier one...
>
> 3. Natural and dominator hierarchies. The third principle is that there is a difference between natural hierarchies and dominator hierarchies. Dominator hierarchies are the ones that you cannot find any universal arguments for and that are used to legitimize exploitation... Natural hierarchies are different—no exploitation is inherent to the hierarchy; it builds on a universal argument that benefits all parties, and it is limited to the specific area in which that benefit can be argued for... Developmental hierarchies can, if used correctly, support such natural hierarchies. Remember, however: All dominator hierarchies disguise themselves as natural ones, to make them appear as “the triple-N” of all hidden oppression: Natural, Normal, Necessary.
>
> 4. Does not transmit. The fourth principle is that the hierarchy does not transmit to other, irrelevant areas or power relations. They should not give “halo effects”. For instance, that you are at a higher cognitive stage than me, doesn’t mean you should get lower taxes or sleep with my wife...
>
> 5. Humility. The fifth principle is humility...
>
> 6. Different dimensions. The sixth principle is simply to know that hierarchical stage theories of human development have different dimensions and that development in one dimension does not necessarily translate into development within another. The dimensions do interact, however...
>
> 7. Sensitivity. The seventh principle is sensitivity. One must recognize that all hierarchies can and do hurt people’s feelings. After all, nobody likes continuously being picked last for the football team. And when you reveal enduring, deep-seated developmental structures that describe vast, qualitative differences between real people, it tends to make some feel elated and others degraded—most of us are, after all, not at the highest stages of human development. That somebody is at a “higher stage” than me, somehow tends to hurt more than the fact that someone has higher grades, has higher IQ, or lifts heavier weights. Developmental hierarchies are just an extremely sensitive topic. What does it feel like to recognize that someone I know genuinely understands deeper aspects of reality than I do? Or that I am less morally developed than another person, a person who adheres to values and ideals that are lost on me? That my mind is more or less permanently incapable of doing what you do routinely? It hurts, quite simply. Maybe not if I think of Einstein at great distance, but if I realize that this younger, junior colleague is hierarchically above me, and that the distance is qualitative and permanent, it tends to really hurt in soft places deep within...
>
> 8. Not all there is. The eighth and last principle is that stages of development are important, but they are obviously not all there is to life, knowledge, talent and meaning, and so they should only be treated as useful psychological tools, never be revered as anything more than that. Just as you can be blind by not understanding the stages of human development, so you can be blinded by staring too much at them. Like the sun, really: Without it, you walk in darkness—but if you keep staring at it all day, you also go blind. It’s when the sun shines on other things that you see them more clearly.
>
> So you need to remember these eight principles for hierarchy to make sense in a progressive, egalitarian manner. But all in all—not understanding the hierarchical stages of human development leaves you more judgmental, more prejudiced, more arrogantly narrow-minded, less competent to understand and empathize with others, and less likely to successfully interpret and predict behaviors (and the events in society). And in order to understand the stages of human development you must admit that they are, at least in some ways, hierarchically ordered. Thus, dealing with hierarchy is not a “necessary evil”; no, it is simply an evil to refuse. Hierarchy, correctly understood, serves the greater good. Again, this only holds true, of course, if we follow the eight principles outlined above. Otherwise we can end up legitimizing dominator hierarchies, contributing to oppression of all sorts.
>
> The point is not to obsess about hierarchy. The point is that if you see hierarchies clearly and don’t imbue them with emotional value, you can relate to them in a more rational and detached manner. There is no need to pretend that we are the driving instructor when we are the student driver—and both parties benefit. The aim here is of course to create a more equal and egalitarian society, where hierarchy matters less, and only in ways that make sense.

> "Surely I, at fifty-five, must have developed and “matured” since I was eighteen? But unfortunately, there is little reason to be very optimistic about such age-related development. Most people, the vast majority, stall in their (hierarchical stage) development relatively early during adult life. Most of us never experience any profound shifts of worldview or perspective after adolescence, let alone increases in the overall complexity of our thinking and behavior. We go through the phases of life in more or less harmonious or tumultuous sequences: love, companionship, work, career, family life, old age—these are best described by the classic psychologist Erik Erikson who identified eight phases from infancy to old age. And in that sense, we all “mature”. But such phases should not, under any circumstances, be confused with the developmental stages we are speaking of here.
>
> Stages are different: They represent a logical sequence, where later stages build upon earlier ones; the later stage transcending and including the earlier stage. It builds upon the earlier stage, adding something to it. Whereas an Eriksonian phase, like old age, can in theory occur even in a young person who gets terminally ill, or just in a population where the average life span is much shorter—a developmental stage is simply not possible to achieve unless you have passed through the earlier stages... You have to learn to count before you can add or subtract—it’s just a fact of life...
>
> After infancy, childhood and adolescence (where hierarchical development follows a roughly predictable age pattern), developmental stages should not be confused with aging or the number of years you have lived...
>
> And stage should not be confused with “skills”; the most masterful and silent navigator in the jungle is probably a humming bird, not a human—it is more “skillful”, due to its biological properties, its swiftness and humble size, but it is certainly at a lower stage of cognitive and psychological development than any human jungle dwellers.
>
> And, here’s another one, psychological stages of development should not be confused with psychologies of “personality”. Psychologies of personality are much more well-known, more academically kosher, and more widely taught than the developmental stage theories. Studies of personality were famously used by the early critical social psychologists in attempts to explain authoritarianism and how people would change under consumer capitalism, etc. There are personality tests such as “the big five” (which looks at traits such as extroversion and conscientiousness), the Holland scale for what people find interesting (if you like fixing cars, helping kids or learning science), studies of cultural patterns of personality (such as Hofstede’s famous research on different countries’ work culture), sibling studies (which more or less lack evidence, apart from small IQ differences) or the tests for different psychopathologies (the psychiatric scales used clinically). But, except perhaps for the psychiatric tests, none of these personality tests have anywhere near the explanatory power and importance as differences in developmental stage—with stage, we’re talking ten times stronger correlations or more. Developmental stage explains a lot of why a person acts like she does: her reasoning, morality, aesthetics, leadership style, close relationships, values, income (even more than class background), and much else. Whereas the psychiatric diagnoses are only good at understanding behaviors in a smaller part of the population (those who have the diagnoses), the stage theories help us understand “normal” behavior in society at large. Please remember, stage is something other than personality.
>
> And—perhaps the easiest trap to fall into—stage development should not be confused with “healthy” psychological development, which is usually what is studied under the headline of “developmental psychology” (if someone has healthy emotional attachment patterns, positive self-image, has dealt with her traumas and whatnot). It is perfectly possible to have a healthy low-stage two-year-old (or a psychologically healthy 184 year old turtle, for that matter) and a psychologically messed up high-stage adult human being. But note that lower stage doesn’t guarantee psychological health, either; we’ve all met a crazy cat at some point. There is all the reason to believe, however, that the development of a human’s psychological health may interact in complex ways with her development into higher stages. Usually this means that a healthy, not too painful, psychological development supports higher stages of development, but not always. Psychopathologies (mental imbalances or sicknesses) of different kinds can also spur psychological development, either by causing discomfort and thereby making us work harder to challenge our current equilibrium—or simply by removing some psychological property that would otherwise have been an obstacle to our growth. For instance, if you have almost no sense of shame, you may not be psychologically “normal”, which causes you to seem “weird”, but this may in turn allow you to make unique experiences and to act with little inhibition—thereby spiking your learning curve and helping you achieve higher stages of development.
>
> ...
>
> So what is “a stage” anyway? It is an equilibrium at a certain degree of complexity, a form of self-supporting balance within your mind, brain, organism—located within an open system of continuously ongoing interactions with the environment. It is the pattern of a self-perpetuating feedback cycle in the organism, a pattern supported by the environment. The living organism is always in a kind of flow, a whirlwind working its way through new matter (metabolism), new impressions, new actions and interactions. And this flow always follows a pattern according to the developmental stage of the organism. Examples, please.
>
> Look at a three-year-old and a (normally developed) eighteen-year-old. There is a qualitative difference between the two organisms. The three-year-old will consistently produce behaviors that are different from those of the young adult—we’re not just talking physiological differences, like size, teeth and sexual maturity. The teenager has better chances of replicating the behaviors of the small child than vice versa and she can produce a range of behaviors and thoughts that may be replicable by her classmates but not by the three-year-old (such as playing the guitar or solving equations at math class). Every day, from the moment they wake up in the morning, the three-year-old and the eighteen-year-old will continuously reproduce equilibria that set them apart. This goes on until some dramatic shift occurs in the three-year-old, who then quickly shifts from one stage to another—and some of the gap closes.

They both live in the same modern society—but the younger one may now have achieved much more advanced ways of reasoning, partaking in more complex behaviors—and perhaps even be more emotionally mature and existentially profound—than her older fellow citizen. It’s not that the older one has had an awful time or anything, everything has been going on “as usual” for the last two decades, and so she hasn’t really gone through any fundamental changes. She is at the same equilibrium as she was two decades ago, whereas the 23-year-old has gone through profound changes time and again. The system of thoughts and behaviors has been shocked, both by biological changes and new environments, and major developmental leaps have been made. Changes of stage usually happen in relatively short leaps that bridge more stable and longer periods of equilibrium. But such stage changes are relatively rare in the lives of adult human beings.

> Our little kiddo has now advanced to a higher stage than her fifteen years older fellow citizen, for instance having acquired philosophical insight, being able to systematically question her own society. But note that the 38-year-old may still be a “better person”, being friendlier, more loving, etc. And she may have skills that the 23-year-old lacks, for instance, being a good professional pianist or a skilled doctor. Again, higher or lower stage does not determine such things—even if it does interact with them." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The pattern that emerges is that you go from earlier stages with simpler, more black-and-white and mechanical or linear ways of functioning, towards being more self-critical, more nuanced, diverse, and—a recurring theme—towards more dialectical forms of thinking and acting...
>
> Another recurring pattern to all of these theories is that you go from focusing on more narrow frameworks (like yourself) towards wider ones (like universal principles, the network of relations you partake in, etc.). This plays out so that the middle stages let you make more and better differentiations, where you notice more and more nuances or differences, and the later stages are when you put these new pieces together in new ways, creating more integrated, overarching wholes. You go from simple black-and-white thinking, to complex and nuanced thinking, and from there to finding new simplicities in the form of underlying, universal, guiding principles: towards what you might call a “second simplicity”." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Michael Lamport Commons’ neo-Piagetian MHC: the Model of Hierarchical Complexity. This model is by far the most scientifically viable and consistent one, and the one that indisputably has the strongest empirical evidence, the strongest explanatory power, and the widest applicability. Based on pure behaviorist psychology, it does not look at anything other than how organisms solve tasks of different “orders of complexity”. These tasks are rated by a mathematical system for understanding at which order of complexity a task is. The model can be used, and often is, for other animals as well. We’ll spend the next two chapters on this theory.
>
> So the fundamental tension here, among the global theories of adult development, is between more holistic ones and the more reductionist Model of Hierarchical Complexity (MHC) of Michael Commons. In this sense, Commons’ theory stands alone against all of the others.
>
> Whereas Kegan’s psychoanalytically influenced theory (drawing on the humanities rather than behavioral science) relates to intimate things such as the evolving sense of self, the MHC does nothing of the sort. It just looks at how complex a task someone can handle, and goes on from there to see how that correlates with other variables, such as income or attitudes (and usually it correlates a lot, a whole lot more than any of the other theories).
>
> But the MHC does not tackle the other issues at hand—what about overall growth of a person’s personality? What about the development of his or her set of values and their worldview, like in Spiral Dynamics? What happens with someone’s emotional development, or existential development, for that matter? Is cognitive complexity really enough to explain all that? I don’t think it is.
>
> All of the mentioned theories, other than the MHC, attempt to be holistic, to really grasp the overall picture of a multifaceted human being developing in many ways, and yet they all fall out less generally applicable than the MHC—a theory that can be used to rank the difficulty of tasks, predict behaviors, describe animals, describe political opinions and many other things. Yet, there really does appear to be more to growing as a human being, than the purely cognitive development of the MHC.
>
> I hold that all of the holistic adult development theories are on to something, but that they all fail to grasp quite what it is. They all make the same mistake: They smash together different forms of development into one and the same model, and force these (interrelated but still distinct and often independently developed) dimensions into the same stages. This is because they fail to distinguish between the dimensions of development with sufficient clarity.
>
> Some of the theories mix things up even worse. Robert Kegan’s theory mixes up stage with Eriksonian life phases, which turns him into a hopeless “gerontophile”: Age is glorified to an almost religious extent. The same goes for Gary Young, perhaps the worst gerontophile of the lot, whose theory in all seriousness implicates that people would become cognitive geniuses only in their fifties and sixties or even later, and only if they manage to work through the emotional family issues pertinent to that age. A similar mistake is apparent in Loevinger’s and Cook-Greuter’s tradition, both of whom even manage to blend in issues of personality into the different stages and spice it up with a bit of psychiatric diagnostics (where the lower stages are described as psychopaths, more or less). Spiral Dynamics is perhaps the most simplistic model, and thereby mixes things a lot, too. It is fashionable among the developmental researchers to disdain it—but it still manages to be the most widely used, perhaps not only because of its simplicity. The model has real merits in that it is at good describing the overall cultural logic inherent to each stage, as I discuss further in chapter 16.
>
> Wilber’s model comes closest to understanding these issues. He speaks of two kinds of development: one of spiritual states and one of cognitive stages. But his model (called the Wilber-Combs lattice) is still spaghetti, mixing up very crucial aspects, which leaves the theory full of weak spots. Perhaps his worst sin is to overemphasize spirituality so that he, for instance, in his detailed maps over human development, places the Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo’s later stages of spiritual development right on top of Michael Commons’ stages of cognitive development—a deeply confused move. Terri O’Fallon elaborates upon Wilber’s model a bit, but she doesn’t quite solve its problems—also dramatically exaggerating the role of spirituality. None of the “Wilberians” seem to have figured out that Wilber smashes together four dimensions into two and that his description of spiritual “states” is lacking in essential aspects, as they fail to account for the varieties of everyday experience (even if Wilber’s writings on spirituality are undeniably insightful).
>
> What all of the holistic models are on to is that purely cognitive development (which is what Commons’ theory describes) leaves out something crucial. But when they attempt to put that “other stuff” in, their models become blurred and much weaker—and certainly much less clear, logical and elegant—than Commons’ theory.
>
> The other theorists have all failed to make some important analytical distinctions: to differentiate between the relevant dimensions of psychological development. And because they haven’t teased out the correct dimensions, they all fail in their attempts to integrate the dimensions into one whole, “holistic” developmental model.
>
> Here is what I believe: Commons is the only one that has discovered one of the four fundamental dimensions of development—that of cognitive development. That’s why his model shows up with so much greater clarity and consistency—and better research results." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "What we are comparing now is horizontal complexity and vertical complexity. Horizontal complexity is simply a measure of how many calculations you have to make (how many yes-no questions you manage to answer). So this is basically how quick and efficient your brain is. A human newborn has much greater horizontal complexity than an adult parrot, even while being at a lower stage. But then again, a computer can have greater horizontal complexity than a human (while still being at stage 0 Computational).
>
> IQ-tests will primarily measure horizontal complexity, given that the test taker is at a certain minimum stage so that they can actually take the test. The more difficult of these tests can include questions at stage 12 Systematic, but not really above that. Most of all, they measure how easily you recognize relatively simple patterns. Obviously, IQ (or “g factor”) is not unimportant, and “intelligence” should perhaps be seen as a combination of horizontal and vertical complexity.
>
> On the other hand, you have organizations like Mensa (top two percent of IQ scores, 132+) and Triple Nine Society (for folks way above Mensa level, at the 99.9th percentile, 146+ IQ)—and somehow these places are hardly full of inventive geniuses, busy changing the world in all manner of ways. So what’s going on here?
>
> It’s that high IQ, in humans, seems to only be loosely correlated with MHC stage. Mensa folks are seldom at the lower adult stages, but they tend to be at stage 11 Formal or stage 12 Systematic. So you have people whose brains are very quick and efficient—but without necessarily climbing to the more abstract forms of thought and behavior of higher vertical complexity. About 67% of your IQ score seems to depend on your MHC stage (or at least, that’s how much the two seem to go hand in hand).
>
> So, what is vertical complexity? The MHC stages measure orders of vertical complexity. This means that each stage coordinates the actions at the preceding stage. You go from constructing stories to finding abstract variables in those stories, to finding relationships between abstract variables, to finding systems of relationships, to finding common properties in systems, and so on. There are actually five rules that determine the relationships between the stages, but here we just need to mention the three most basic ones—it’s a bit technical, but bear with me:
>
> • Higher-order actions are defined in terms of lower-order actions. This makes the higher-order tasks include the lower ones and requires that lower-order actions are hierarchically contained within the relative definitions of the higher-order tasks.
>
> • Higher order of complexity actions organize lower-order actions. This makes them more powerful. Lower-order actions are organized by the actions undertaken with higher order of complexity, i.e., more complex tasks.
>
> • Higher order of complexity actions organize those lower-order actions in a non-arbitrary way.
>
> ...
>
> The super-intelligent folks of world history are the ones who happen to have both exceptionally high IQ and MHC stage—the clearest example being John von Neumann, a Hungarian 20th century Jew who moved to the US, and arguably the smartest person who ever lived. A super child prodigy, his displayed behavior clearly reached stage 15 Crossparadigmatic already in his early twenties, when he was able to apply very abstract principles to a wide host of problems. He “invented the computer” (almost), developed game theory (which may have contributed to saving us from nuclear holocaust—or perhaps brought us to the brink of one), predicted the Second World War, contributed to cybernetics, information science and quantum physics—and worked on more strands of mathematics and physics than perhaps any other scientist. All before he died at age 53.
>
> Why then aren’t all the high IQ folks over at Triple Nine Society doing the same as von Neumann? Because they don’t also have exceptionally high cognitive MHC stage, that’s why. Their “cognitive pyramids” are wide but not necessarily tall.
>
> But then again, whereas von Neumann may be a role model for testosterone jacked boys who want to be the best and smartest and “conquer the world”, he is perhaps not the highest ideal for a mature humanity. He did work on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear arms, after all. He was not ahead of his time in terms of progressive values (being a militaristic anti-communist), he had a failed first marriage, was a notoriously bad driver who would read books while driving—and on his deathbed he betrayed his agnostic principles, suddenly converting to Catholicism (perhaps in fear of death). In other words, there may be other dimensions to human development than intellectual brilliance. It’s safe to say, that when it comes to spiritual or existential development, von Neumann was about average, like the most of us. He was exceptionally intelligent, but probably not exceptionally “wise”.
>
> ...
>
> But maybe, once we know more about learning and the brain—and perhaps epigenetics (i.e. how genes change with the environment)—we will be able to affect the development of MHC stage and IQ, likely by design of living conditions from childhood and onwards. After all, we know about the so-called “Flynn effect”, i.e. the observation that, in modern societies, IQ seems to increase with every generation—this goes both for what they call crystallized intelligence (based on prior knowledge and habit) and fluid intelligence (working memory, speed, etc.). Would it be possible to find a similar pattern for MHC?
>
> One thing that would suggest that MHC stage is more volatile than Commons suggests, is the fact that the same MHC stages can show up in brains of very different sizes and shapes: The parrot’s brain displays the same stage as a human three-year-old. Maybe, then, the “stage” is some kind of pattern in the overall communication of the brain, a pattern than can shift by being stimulated by the environment? The future holds the answers.
>
> What we indisputably can do, however, is to affect the development of the other three dimensions: code, state and depth. These three are more volatile and subject to change.

> "If we look at the four stages 10 Abstract, 11 Formal, 12 Systematic and 13 Metasystematic, we cover about 90% of a normal adult human population. A small percentage fall below this range (being stage 9 Concrete, which is still within the normal range, or below that, which is less common) and only a negligible fraction fall above it (being at stages 14 Paradigmatic and 15 Crossparadigmatic). If you learn to recognize these four stages, you will be able to see at which stage almost everyone in your vicinity operates." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "As stage 10 Abstract thinkers, we cannot see the general rules that govern when our abstractions should apply, when they can be expected to have certain properties and so forth. This means that we will tend to focus on one single variable and want to either increase or decrease its quantitative value: less immigration, lower taxes, more love, more dialogue, less greed etc.
>
> If confronted with a counter-argument (e.g. that more dialogue also means more time-consuming squabble, which in turn may not serve the purpose) the stage 10 Abstract thinker will simply insist upon having both: more dialogue and less time-consuming squabble. This is the less complex form of both-and thinking: not accounting for a productive tension between both sides, but simply denying that one’s argument has trade-offs or downsides.
>
> As stage 10 Abstract thinkers we can sometimes insist upon doing things that to others is apparently counter-productive. For instance, the management department at a (modern, computerized) hospital can decide to cut the budget and make a decision to close down many of the printers. In effect, this may cause the nurses to walk much longer stretches to the printers farther away, in effect costing much higher wages if seen per hour and reducing efficiency—just to save some ink. In this case (which is taken from real life) the management uses the singular variable (“saving costs”) but fails to coordinate it with other variables (“cost per effective hour of work”) and in effect make budget cuts that are directly wasteful.
>
> Have you ever been in an argument where you patiently and politely address the inconsistencies of your counterpart’s argument, but they seem to repeat the same phrase or concept as if it were an answer in itself? This is probably a stage 10 Abstract thinker. At this stage we can spot obvious factual inconsistencies, but we cannot spot inconsistencies in how we apply abstract variables: for instance, lower taxes and higher welfare, please! And if you point out that there may be a trade-off, the stage 10 Abstract thinker will think that you are being vague and just playing with words." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Generally, because of cognitive bias, stage 11 Formal thinkers will tend to like to stick with certain principles. Of course, sometimes finding the simple principle or rule that guides the apparent messiness of reality can be a mark of much higher cognitive stages (think Newton). But if people like to stick with rules and principles not invented by themselves and they tend to make linear plans about the future and tend to focus on single if-this-then-that principles, you are probably dealing with stage 11 Formal thinking.
>
> In politics, stage 11 Formal thinkers generally have a penchant for clear ideologies or doctrines: socialism, libertarianism and the like. They are likely to repeat one common wisdom, e.g. the conservative idea that things often go wrong when you try to be utopian or the radical idea that most social change has come through struggle.
>
> Remember, this is the most common stage. Adult middle class people in a modern society will very often be of this stage of cognitive complexity. At this stage we don’t really produce our own theories or solutions, simply following the rules and habits set out by others. We can of course still be intelligent (high IQ), artistic, imaginative, skilled and so forth." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

So one way to spot them is simply to ask them questions about their opinions: If there are few rules of thumb and clear conclusions, but much weighing of different factors, it may be stage 12 Systematic.
>
> The stage 12 Systematic thinkers are often more inventive than others, so if the person has made unconventional innovations, this may indicate this stage.
>
> But perhaps the easiest way may be by means of their cognitive biases: Stage 12 Systematic thinkers tend to believe that the world consists of systems and their properties.

> "SOME STAGE 13 METASYSTEMATIC REASONING ABOUT POLITICS
>
> • Anti-racist argument: Racism emerges as different cultures and status hierarchies interact, where ethnic markers are used in order to increase one’s position in the status hierarchy. It should be prevented by the creation of both greater psychological security and by the facilitation of productive dialogue about cultural differences.
>
> • Conservative argument: Liberal values prevalent in Western countries may be more functional in late modern society than the more traditionalist values of many Arab Muslims, but for the successful integration of these different cultures one must take the perspectives of all parties seriously.
>
> • Feminist argument: Feminism is an interest group movement as well as a social justice movement. As an interest group movement it must be weighed against other interests and perspectives. As a social justice movement it must be coordinated with other social justice issues such as class, ethnicity, global inequality, other gender issues (including men’s issues), and the exploitation of animals and nature.
>
> • Libertarian argument: State control and policy implementation always interact with other societal systems and are dependent upon these for their successful functioning. It is thus important to carefully weigh state regulation and policy against other possibilities: markets, culture, and civil sphere. State regulation is often not the best path ahead.
>
> • Green argument: The logic inherent to the economic system is fundamentally alien to the logic of the ecosystems of the many biotopes. This means that there is no self-regulating feedback cycle directly present between our economic and technological expansion and the ecosystems upon which we depend. This lack of feedback means that we have to drive the ecosystem to collapse before the market self-adjusts. We must thereby create some other feedback, e.g. by means of policy, public awareness or cultural development.
>
> • Day-to-day politics: Public spending can be high or low, where higher spending is generally made possible by strong institutions such as rule of law, policing, democracy and free press. This keeps corruption down and allows for public support of spending and makes spending less wasteful. There is no one answer about high or low taxes; you have to coordinate it with the other societal systems.

> Note that the different political stances at stage 13 Metasystematic generally have more in common with one another than with the corresponding ideological positions at the earlier stages. This has important implications for metamodern politics." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The other thing that happened was that I learned more about cognitive development (more generally, not just the MHC) and came across ideas that nuance the picture. I’d like to bring two of them to the table here: downward assimilation and scaffolding.
>
> Downward assimilation means that, because of our ability to share a common language, you can take a word, symbol, sentence or even an attitude, that originated at a higher order of complexity, and still use it. Your use of that symbol will then inevitably follow the logic of your own stage, but it might still bring some meaning with it, and you can perhaps partake in conversations that would otherwise lie beyond your own stage of complexity. The complex symbol is assimilated “downwards”.
>
> ...
>
> The second concept, scaffolding, brings some hope to this misery. It is possible, namely, through the means of language and communicative actions, to support someone’s cognitive stage upwards—not just one, but two stages. Language has to be nature’s most awesome creation! Through language and interaction you create a “scaffold” that helps the other person to partake in behaviors that would otherwise be beyond his or her cognitive stage...
>
> The same goes for the rest of us: Language structures seem to be able to help us more than a bit. That’s largely how education works. But it usually takes long hours of interaction with people who are of higher stage than ourselves and who really walk us through the correct sequences again and again.
>
> So this social-psychological aspect of development creates plenty of room for flexibility (if you like, a compromise between Piaget’s rigid stages and Vygotsky’s faith in social context and human malleability).
>
> The common language also “stores” structures and patterns for us to use, so that a certain thought or behavior becomes more easily attainable. For instance, it is easier to understand what a “gravity field” is once people have discovered, named and explained it. So scaffolding is the other side of the coin of “downward assimilation”; when we grasp for notions that are out of our cognitive depth, we also stretch our minds, and we come under the influence of thoughts and ideas that would otherwise be beyond us.
>
> These two concepts, downward assimilation and scaffolding, explain a lot about why the MHC stages are so difficult to spot in the fussy world around us: We simply misinterpret the MHC stages because of their dependence on contexts and interactions. Add to this that we have three more dimensions of adult development (code, state and depth), and also IQ, specific skills, different levels of education, psychological health, and different ways to evaluate each other’s smarts. To further complicate things, the transition between two stages seems to happen in eight steps, where you gradually learn to coordinate things at the preceding order of complexity (the discussion of which I have omitted from this text). Phew! It should come as no surprise that the MHC stages are hidden in plain sight.
>
> When the underlying order in the chaos is so difficult to see, it can be very tempting to conclude that the world is simply fussy, disordered—and even to wear that skeptical conclusion as a badge of anti-reductionist honor, as a mark of our own open-mindedness, humility and spirituality. But there is nothing open-minded, humble or spiritual in failing to see—and properly respond to—the undeniable regularities in human behavior that are revealed by the elegant but merciless simplicity of experimental, empirical science.
>
> People try to resist these perspectives and theories in many ways, the most common perhaps being to attempt to typify the stages, making them into different “types” that cannot really be compared, thus relativizing the differences. It is a tempting move, because types are a so much less sensitive topic.
>
> Such relativization is in fact an inversion of what 19th century colonial thinkers did when they “stageified” different types (human races) into dominator hierarchies (white above black, etc.). Just as the Europeans invented false and arbitrary stage theories to justify their colonial political stances, so do people today invent false and arbitrary type theories to defend their political stances (ignoring the relevant research results of stage theories)—to defend ideals of equality.
>
> But you can’t wish the stage differences away. It’s just dishonest and counter-productive. There really is a logic to the order, and being at stage 10 Abstract is not simply “same, same but different” as being at stage 13 Metasystematic. There is a huge qualitative difference.
>
> Developmental stages should not be confused with “types” (black/ white, male/female, East/West, quiet/talkative, etc.). Types are those things that really are beyond hierarchical comparison, indeed “same, same but different”. Stages constitute a logical, hierarchical and empirically verifiable order.

> But remember what David Hume taught us: an “ought” cannot be derived from an “is”. The fact that something happens to be true doesn’t make it right in a moral sense. Likewise, the opposite is true: an “is” cannot be derived from and “ought”. That something factual doesn’t rhyme with a moral intuition we have, doesn’t make it fictional. No matter how provocative—it’s still true, whether we like it or not, and then we have to make the best of it...

> Listen, the fact is that people are of different cognitive stages, plain and simple. Deal with it, and use it for something good.

Note that this means that a person can have a relatively low average state, but still have great depth, as she has experienced higher states before and holds them in clear memory—she “knows her way around them” and can understand other people living, acting or thinking from such states, even if she herself may never again experience these same states." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "To understand how depth develops we must again underscore the difference between state and depth. The subjective state of an organism only ever exists in the “now”, in any one given moment. Depth is something that develops and accumulates over time. States come and go; depth very rarely decreases (only if you become senile or the like)—once you have reached a level of depth, it tends to stay." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The people we like to imagine as “spiritual masters” are the ones that have both high average state and great depth. But then again, we should really not deify such folks; first of all, they too have bad days, and second of all, we might be mistaken (and there is no reliable way for us to check). And there is also a host of potential pathologies (sicknesses) that come with the territory of greater depth and higher states (spiritual arrogance, tendencies for holistic visions that lean towards totalitarianism, and other things; these things need not concern us here). And, again, they can be limited in other respects (low complexity, outdated code, etc.). In fact, they usually are.
>
> So, developing depth means to experience new states and to integrate them into one’s psychological constitution so that they “permanently” change one’s relatedness to the world and to existence as a whole." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "What a strange faculty! How can it be, that a human being can look into a deep-space telescope and recognize faraway galaxies as aesthetically pleasing or awe-inspiring? Beauty, in this sense, is a kind of recognition. We recognize things such as harmony, balance, proportionality, contrast, pattern, variation, rhythm, repetition; aspects of the world that we spontaneously seem to appreciate. We appear to be able to deepen our relationship with reality by expanding this recognition." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "In a world of misery and evil, at least there is the truth. The pre-modern wisdom traditions have been (and still are) quite weak in this regard, despite the rich scholarly traditions of our monasteries. The awe and curiosity that stem from recognizing the open horizons of the mysteries of the elegant universe, of nature, and of reality itself, are not what people will usually learn to cultivate at Zen retreats. In fact, there tends to be lingering pre-modern irrationalities and beliefs that disrespect any honest search for truth, often supported by explicit anti-intellectualism. On the other hand, our scientifically inspired mainstream society tends to instrumentalize science and knowledge to an excessive degree, reframing it as “academic achievement”. The spiritual meaning of science, of knowingness, is subdued to grosser human needs, such as acknowledgment, status, accomplishment, material prosperity and survival. That being said, the recognition of mystery may be the most accepted and encouraged form of depth development in modern society. There should probably be better ways to tap into it, in order to cultivate a more existentially mature and transnational civilization." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The third form of depth development is the recognition of tragedy. It is the sense and realization that we live in a tragic universe. If there is a fundamental divide between the innocence of (healthy) childhood and the maturity of adulthood, it is that children live in blissful unknowing of the utter tragedy of existence, whereas the (spiritually mature) adult lives in full awareness of suffering. To be spiritually mature means both accepting the unavoidability of suffering and being resolved to prevent and mitigate it.
>
> ...
>
> Depth as tragedy is development of the 2nd person relatedness to reality. This is the depth of the saint, the bodhisattva (an Eastern equivalent of the saint) and of what in Western philosophy is called “philosophical pessimism” (perhaps Schopenhauer is the best example). It is the depth that grows from living with a broken heart. Tragedy is necessary for us to mature beyond our current, limited form of “humanity” and begin to take responsibility for all sentient beings in all times. Only a sense of tragedy can drive us to work for the wretched of the earth: loving until it hurts; as medieval nuns of contemplative Christianity, licking the wounds of lepers. And for this reason—I can say with perfect conviction—that only broken hearts can save the world." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "We surrender to the primacy of subjective experience (beauty), to the innocent face we have to serve and protect (tragedy), or to the search for truth (mystery)." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "A large portion of people in modern society believe that they have tear-drenched, profound inner depths which can only rarely be found in others. But as I said, it’s a mirage. The truth is that very many of us harbor greater inner depths than we normally manifest in our lives, or than others normally recognize in us. We are just not offered the social situations to manifest these inner depths. So we keep it to ourselves. There, another meaningless and excruciating tragedy of existence.
>
> Moreover, we are generally only capable of recognizing the forms of depth that we have developed ourselves: The mystery-driven scientist fails to see that her seemingly simple-minded neighbor has developed a much more profound sense of tragedy of the world, and so forth. With “the voice in our heads” (our normal verbalized thinking) we continue long monologues over the years, believing that we are different from the others. And they think that they are different in the same way. In a way, we are talking about the opposite problem from the one that shows up in spiritual communities, where everyone pretends to be of higher state than they really are: In mainstream society, we generally pretend to have less depth than we really do.
>
> As a society, we have not admitted to ourselves just how utterly vulnerable, how beautiful and pathetically tragic we are—and in our loneliness we tend to flatter ourselves with unwarranted beliefs of how uniquely profound we are as “individuals”, just how different we are from “most other people” (but we’re not).
>
> A crucial aspect of the maturation of humanity is that we not only begin to actively and deliberately cultivate depth in all three aspects (beauty, mystery and tragedy) as well as depth in both its light and dark form—but also that we create institutions and social settings in everyday life that are much more proficient when it comes to accommodating our inner depths. This includes managing the inescapable and troublesome fact that people are at different levels of depth." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "The effective value meme is an overall pattern of the mind; it is an equilibrium upon which one’s values and worldview tend to stabilize, setting the framework for the political behavior of a citizen. The effective value meme is usually not an explicitly held body of thought—it’s more like the water a fish swims in; how your whole reality appears to you, even before you notice anything that dwells within that reality.
>
> A population always has a developmental demographic of some kind, with some people at earlier and others at later effective value memes. Later value memes are more logically and functionally in tune with larger and more complex societies. A large host of the problems of today’s world are of this nature; they are developmental imbalances.
>
> The world is a terrible mess because the world-system we live in corresponds to a very high effective value meme, while almost all of the world’s population is still left at earlier effective value memes.
>
> We live, essentially, in a retarded world. Our value systems do not correspond to the society we live in. Our ways of seeing, sensing, feeling, acting and understanding do not correspond to the very society that we ourselves have created. This glitch is lethal. And this is the issue of our age: to develop the political psychology of the world population. Unfortunately, stimulating such political-psychological development is an enormously tricky matter.
>
> So developing the effective value meme of the general population is one of the most important things in the world right now. But a higher effective value meme is not always good: Each stage of development has its own risks and its own pathologies—there are new things that can (and sooner or later always do) go horribly, horribly wrong.
>
> Your effective value meme is a kind of average between your complexity, code, state and depth. It is called “effective” value meme because people tend to have an overall pattern of how they function in society even if they cannot easily be squeezed into one of Beck and Cowan’s vMemes; hence they are “in effect” at one value meme, even if they may differ in one or more regards (for instance having lower complexity or greater depth)." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "METAMODERN VALUE MEME... The primary characteristic of people of this value meme is that they value qualitative development of human beings: that people go up in stage, that psychological development is supported and that you work to create a new society beyond the modern one. Because they have a more developmental perspective, they also accept, learn from and try to include all of the former value memes. This is quite unlike any of the other value memes, all of whom believe that they alone have the right path. The Metamodern value meme is less judgmental; it seeks to integrate elements from all the former ones; it sees partial truths in all of them; it wants to integrate them in one grand synergistic scheme, and seeks to accommodate them—to create a society in which traditional, modern and postmodern people live together harmoniously.
>
> And in that vein, the Metamodern value meme is less ostensibly oriented towards a political Right or Left. People of other value memes, like the exploitative boards of major corporations, even folks like the fundamentalist terrorists, are not seen as evil. They are, to put it bluntly, developmentally challenged. Retarded. This means that you need to understand these people and why things couldn’t be any different, and why they bear no guilt. It is a sociological-developmental view of life. Of course, the risk with seeing development instead of moral responsibility, is that you can be condescending. It is simply part of the challenge; if you are seen as condescending, it simply means that you have failed to successfully take the perspective of others and adjust your communication accordingly.
>
> But the metamodern mind also realizes that an inclusive and harmonious society cannot be achieved within the confines of modern life or by means of a postmodern critique thereof. Hence, a new society must be created from the modern one, which means that the metamodernist must ultimately be against modern society.
>
> The second characteristic is that they value inner dimensions much more. So you will find that people of this value meme seek to create more authenticity and intimacy in work organization, to democratize institutions with clever social innovations, to promulgate mindfulness and meditation practices, to emphasize more philosophical and existential issues in their work. They will tend to be very process-oriented, trying to involve people in interactive processes a lot more." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "But all of this has a rather innocent origin: bad theory. The cure to this madness is good theory." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "So, death to TURQUOISE (and its equally unrealistic counterparts in other theories). Long live the Metamodern effective value meme. Even if it is still being born, it can and will change the world. There will of course be value memes beyond the Metamodern, but the time just hasn’t come, not by far. The “post-metamodern” value meme can only show up once a Metamodern society has manifested and can be criticized on its own premises. Up until that point, the belief in higher value memes is fool’s gold." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Which brings us to the Metamodern value meme. The postmodern mind believes in there being such things as “power structures”, “ideology”, “postcolonialism”, “patriarchy” and “discourses”. The metamodern mind sees beyond these explanations; it understands that the postmodern mind is still being essentialist, i.e. that it believes in essences which are inherent to these invisible forces. The postmodern mind thinks that there is some kind of metaphysical evil called “power structures” and that you can remove this evil by invoking its opposite: emancipating critique, deconstruction, inclusion, more soft and relativist values and so forth. But that means you still believe in there being some evil “out there” and you being the “good guy”: No longer the bad intentions of others, but certainly a collective and sociological evil that must be destroyed. The Metamodern value meme doesn’t believe in anything like that. It sees that all of these things only emerge by necessity, as emergent properties of complex systems. It sees the world as more mechanical, and less good or evil—all things are explainable, and there are no evil patriarchy spirits or ghosts of colonialism past. These are illusions, just interpretations of effects of self-organizing systems. And the way to solve these problems is not by “crushing patriarchy”, but by genuinely understanding the ideas, perspectives and behaviors of all stakeholders, and by finding ways to develop them and otherwise affect their behaviors and interactions. More secular than the postmodern mind.
>
> So step by step, the belief in a “ground of reality”, in “true essences”, is pushed farther into the periphery. Step by step, people acquire a worldview in which larger parts of reality can be questioned, and thereby explained, and thereby governed. The spirits and ghosts are exorcized again and again. The main takeaway from this is, as I have indicated several times already, that we shouldn’t see people at the Modern value meme as “secular”. They believe all sorts of deeply irrational and crazy things, and they cannot be trusted to act rationally in matters of societal development. This is because they will tend to rely upon much too rigid an unquestioned assumptions about reality. Only the Metamodern value meme can see the world with a sufficient sobriety. Secularism isn’t really about religion vs. non-religion, or spirituality vs. non-spirituality; it is about expanding the ability to question and recreate reality.
>
> To achieve a secular world is not about making people not believe in Jesus or Allah anymore; that’s just a speck on the larger map. A secular world must be governed by metamodern principles. That’s what it’s about. Anything less than that will still be a world governed by crazy, irrational and outdated ideas. You go from spirits to gods to a universal God, to reductionist science, to critique and sociology of knowledge, to an understanding of transpersonalism and complexity. At every step, you kill the spirits and gods of yesteryear. The metamodern creed is, at its core, married to an atheism so pervasive and radical that even the modern and postmodern gods are exposed as illusions.
>
> All of the value memes claim to be secular. All claim to speak of universal truth. The problem is that they can only see as far as their own value meme; hence they all believe that they have dispelled the myths and reached “reality”. They are all wrong. Even metamodernism is wrong. But unlike all the others, we know it ourselves. A higher form of secularism is rising. And lagging terribly." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "When societies, for any number of reasons, produce large segments of populations that are lagging behind when it comes to value meme development, you get value meme retardation. The word retardation means “being too late”, which is what we’re talking about here. It is important to understand that this is indeed what is going on...
>
> ... What I want with the term is simply to point out that we, as a global society, are falling behind in our developmental psychology.
>
> I also did it for effect. We live, essentially, in a retarded world. Not then, an evil world, a fallen world, a world of greed and capitalism, a world out of touch with Mother Nature, a crude materialist world—but a retarded world." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "So where do “magic beliefs” come from? Of course, in an animistic society, it is normal to believe in magic. But strangely, you can find all kinds of magic beliefs in modern people as well—even among the educated and intelligent ones. For instance, I have encountered any number of successful modern people who think that fate has something in stall for them, that the world around them conspired to reveal that they were special, that they can “sense” what is going to happen, that there is such a thing as “synchronicity” (the idea that very improbable things happen because the world supports you in your spiritual journey), that a loving heart can literally heal somebody at a distance, that really advanced Zen masters can walk through walls or levitate (float above the ground)—the list goes on. Of course, none of this is true. It’s all make-believe and nonsense or there are perfectly natural explanations (for instance, the experience of “synchronicity” can be explained by a combination of selective memory, self-deceit, narcissism, probability theory and network or cluster effects). We live in a magical and miraculous world, but there is no magic and there are no miracles.
>
> What we are dealing with in these many cases is the occurrence of the magic residual, i.e. that people have seen greater depth, mystery and beauty in the world than their cognitive minds—and their available symbolic codes—can handle. Thus, there is a glitch, a developmental imbalance, through which magical beliefs and other superstitions can sneak in.
>
> The way we conventionally think about it is that intelligent and complex thinkers are the ones that are resistant to magical beliefs. There is of course a lot of research to support this claim. But I hold that this is only half-true. The researchers didn’t ask the right question. What you should look for is how depth, state, complexity and code relate to one another. You find magic beliefs in people who are of greater depth and higher state in comparison to their complexity and symbolic code. Magic can be reintroduced again and again in smaller doses at the higher stages of complexity. Whereas kids believe in snarks and magic tricks, above average complex adults can believe in “synchronicity”, reincarnation, the astral plane, flows of subtle energy, spiritual family constellation work, telepathy, the Maya calendar, that you can “manifest” things in your life by way of thoughts and wishes, or even just that God hears your prayers (again, it’s all utter bogus).
>
> I have heard any number of serious psychotherapists and PhDs (even within the natural sciences) go on about this stuff. It is not because these folks are more stupid than your average modern Joe—on the contrary, they are above average intelligence—but because they out-depth and out-state themselves.
>
> This creates a rather strange matter of affairs: The people at the highest value memes—like Metamodern—are more likely, rather than less, to believe in preposterous and magical things. The magic residual has snuck in. The exact same openness towards the beauty and mystery of the universe, that sense of grand wholeness and awe, also cracks your head open so that the most dim-witted of ideas can sneak in and stick.
>
> ...
>
> Hey, I told you development wasn’t an easy, straightforward matter. I told you higher value memes aren’t always better. But then again, is it so bad if these folks believe in a little magic? Has it ever done any harm?
>
> Yes. It is deeply, severely harmful. In today’s global capitalist, postindustrial internet society, magical beliefs are a social pathology, a disease of the mind. Why? Because they open up the door for any number of misuses of power. If there is magic in the world, anyone who you believe has more contact with this magic than you do, gains arbitrary power over you. You surrender your own mental faculties to them, and from there on, very bad things can and will happen. It is the royal road to totalitarianism.
>
> Also, all magic beliefs make you waste time and energy doing things that simply don’t work. These faulty towers of thought can cause all kinds of nasty hang-ups that make your life miserable. And given the state of the world, we just don’t have the time for your “subtle energy purification” and magic spells. Not even for your prayers—unless you mean contemplative prayer, the purpose of which is to develop your own psychology. Most of all, this kind of fuzzy thinking makes it difficult to think correct, complex, analytical thoughts: It can hinder your successful management of complexity.
>
> But there is another kind of developmental imbalance that is just as harmful: reductionism. The prickly people. It is when you out-complex and out-code your own depth and state. Whereas the harm in magic beliefs is quite obvious, reductionism is harmful in a more subtle way. It is when your mind picks everything apart and uses its intellect in a much-too-instrumental manner. The world appears too dead, too meaningless, too mechanical for you to really care about it.
>
> At a subtle level, the reductionist feels a vague aggression towards reality and existence: “Was this all?” You gain a sense of satisfaction, a faint feeling of revenge, from exposing reality for the meaningless, dead piece of indifferent shit that it really is. You pick it apart and see that there is always hardness beneath the softness, selfishness beneath the love, mechanics beneath the wonder, and so forth. The reductionist mind is blind to the greater whole, blind to serving a deeper principle of life. It becomes a cancer: Thinking, thinking, serving small and selfish desires by turning all of existence into an extraction project. And why not? Reality is dead, meaningless dirt. And I will use my hard, effective reason to show that all that glitters is only ever grime. But at least I will get what I want." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "What happens if you have a modern state, with all of its power, bureaucracy and technology—and you rule it with the mental framework of Genghis Khan? Nazism, that’s what happens. Nazism isn’t pure evil; it is a value meme retardation, a developmental imbalance. Nothing more.
>
> What happens if you have free information in a super-efficient, self-organizing global network of computers (i.e. the internet) and some people use it for holy war, following the Faustian value meme so that its warriors can go to Valhalla? You get Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
>
> What happens if you have nanotechnology and biological hacking readily available, and millions of people use these super-technologies in a narrowly profit-maximizing capitalist manner? What happens when an authoritarian Chinese government gets its hands on metamodern theory (or an equivalent) and starts using it in a non-democratic, manipulative way? I guess we’ll find out pretty soon.

> "Why the Postmoderns Cannot Save the World
>
> To the pomos, the metamodern revolution looks like something that crawled straight out of hell. Suddenly, it’s all back: hierarchies and developmental models and grandes histories and social engineering—even spirituality.
>
> Except this time, you keep losing the arguments. Every time you attack this obvious evil, you end up being the bad guy. When you say that they are hierarchical, they admit it and say that if you don’t accept hierarchies, you are being judgmental yourself. When you tell them they are accommodating hillbilly racists, they say that hillbilly perspectives cannot be excluded and that you are attacking them from a position of greater cultural capital, a position of privilege. (Besides, if you despise hillbillies and mainstream whites but not the same positions within other communities, you are implicitly downgrading other ethnicities, as whites are seen as more morally responsible than minorities.) When you accuse them of excusing capitalism, they point out that they are better at creating an alternative than you have been (see my other book, Outcompeting Capitalism). When you say that they are deterministic, crude developmentalists, they answer with empirical evidence and note that if you’re not a developmentalist you can’t say why feminism and animals rights would be better than mainstream capitalism. When you say that they are being mystical and “new agey”, they point out that your own position is based upon beliefs that cannot be proven, and that you are excluding and degrading minorities if you devalue all their spiritual experiences. When you tell them that their developmental view is elitist, they point out that a vast majority of the population feels extremely alienated by your own values, but that metamoderns at least allow for a developmental path that leads to their own position. When you say they don’t oppose patriarchy, they point out that patriarchy is context dependent and so you cannot categorically hate it. When you rage against the machine and neoliberalism, they point out that you are being essentialist, ascribing inherent qualities to complex phenomena that couldn’t possibly have an “inner essence”. When you say that they are not egalitarian enough, they point out that you have an elitist, narrow conception of equality. When you say that they think they have the one truth, they say that their developmental model implies that there are yet higher value memes, which your own model does not. When you say they are obsessed with development, they point out that development is always messy, context bound and problematic and that your only alternative seems to be moralism.
>
> Being confronted with metamodernism is an extremely frustrating experience for the postmodern mind. People so much want to believe that they themselves are the good guys. But when faced with a higher effective value meme, you are beaten on your own terms.
>
> It is, admittedly, tempting to gloat at the painful confusion that this can cause people who hold opinions and perspectives differing from our own. Postmodernists have shown very little mercy against the modern mainstream people these last few decades: Using all manner of judgmental shaming strategies and political correctness to make people comply with moral causes like gender equality, anti-racism and animal rights.
>
> Note, however, that the real difference between postmodernists and metamodernists is that the latter have solidarity with the perspectives of others. Hence, unlike the postmodernists, the metamodernists don’t judge people for their opinions. And so, they will understand that a normal postmodern person has struggled all her life to find some meaning and a moral compass in this dark world. And now that she has finally found it, and uses it to serve her conscience, some strange person shows up and takes it away from her—leaving her alone and confused in a world of darkness, where evil can and will reign. (Or that’s what it feels like.)
>
> And because the metamodern mind can see that, because she takes responsibility for and cares about people working from all perspectives, she is superior to the postmodern mind. She doesn’t judge capitalist society, or conservative Christians, or even the terrorist bombers. She sees that only by understanding their perspectives—and synthesizing them so that they can work together, or at least find less destructive outlets—can you affect their behaviors. And she doesn’t judge the postmodern, but has solidarity with her.
>
> Because the fact is, for global society to become genuinely peaceful, non-exploitative, sustainable and free from animal slavery, you would need a solid majority of the world population at the Postmodern value meme. Since that isn’t going to happen anytime soon—perhaps not for another century—our society can and will crash if people don’t actively and consciously manage all of the existing value memes: from animistic to metamodern.
>
> And since the Postmodern value meme doesn’t admit the existence of value memes—and believes that all will be fine if you go on “fighting patriarchy” and “explaining abolitionist animal rights” and “curbing racism” or “crushing global capitalism” or “creating a movement of protestors” or “criticizing society’s power structures” or making more casual words and expressions taboo—they simply cannot productively manage the other value memes.
>
> The postmoderns end up alienating a vast majority of normal modern people, making them feel confused, insulted and frustrated. And once that has gone on for a long while, the majority revolts and begins voting with Trump and the nationalists. Non-postmodern people begin to feel a subtle sense of revenge when somebody speaks out against political correctness.
>
> The Metamodern value meme can and will manage people of lower value memes, finding ways to include them in more productive manners. This is what the postmoderns cannot do. Nor can they devise a plan for increasing the effective value meme over a few decades.
>
> So the Metamodern value meme is here to stay. It is just a fact of life that the different value memes cannot really be friends. After all, each value meme is defined precisely opposing its predecessor.
>
> But again—why can’t we just stay at postmodern? After all, things were so nice. We were the good guys; anarchists, communitarians, multiculturalists, environmentalists, vegans, queer feminists, inter-faith dialogue people, volunteering activists, creative industries workers who gave much of our income to charity. Why can’t we just keep doing our thing?
>
> Because it doesn’t work, that’s why. Most people are of other value memes, and they really don’t want what you want. And because you cannot get most people on board, because you confuse, alienate and even disgust them, they won’t cooperate. They won’t buy your framework. Did you ever notice that most people just don’t care about your activism? They really don’t care about you.
>
> Postmoderns cannot save the world. Certainly not Noam Chomsky. The poor old man, for all his intelligence and kindness, is profoundly deluded. Noam Chomsky is profoundly deluded. The world doesn’t work the way he says it does. Not even Bono can save us.
>
> What can? The metamodern value meme. And how? By means of creating a listening society; one that can bring a majority of people to the Postmodern value meme, and a solid percentage to the Metamodern value meme—perhaps even more than two percent of the population. We can develop both code, state and depth. It remains to be seen to what extent cognitive complexity can be extended in a human population.

> But since there are currently no metamodern governments in the world, nobody’s expending time and resources to find out. Which might be a problem." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Metamodernists define themselves through the struggle of value memes against value memes: It’s not if you’re Right or Left that matters the most, but how complex your thinking is." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> "Metamodernism, the word, is a silly adaptation in a way. “Meta” means “after” in old Greek, just like “post” does in Latin—so it’s the same word as postmodernism, basically. But the connotations are different. The “meta” prefix brings to mind such things as “meta-discussion”, i.e. a discussion about the discussion and “meta-theory”, which is theory about theories. So the metamodern cultural phase somehow brings with it a bird’s eye on modern life and it begins to reflect more deliberately upon it, to try to shape it.
>
> Meta is often taken to mean above, or beyond—and sometimes both of these. Metamodernism as a cultural phase is what comes after postmodernism, but it does so by being more postmodern than postmodernism itself—just as the postmodernism of the 1980s was more secular and disenchanted than the modernist mindset itself.
>
> ... But metamodernism is qualitatively very, very different from postmodernism: It accepts progress, hierarchy, sincerity, spirituality, development, grand narratives, party politics, both-and thinking and much else. It puts forward dreams and makes suggestions. And it is still being born." - [The Listening Society, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society)

> “The listening society” is the name for a vision of the future welfare sys­tem which expands and deepens the current universal welfare pro­grams by add­ressing the higher psychological needs of human beings such as belong­ing, esteem and self-actualization—a welfare system determined to ensure that as many as possible don’t feel lonely, socially inferior or trapp­ed in meaning­less lives.
>
> The listening society is a welfare society that considers the emo­tional wellbeing of people just as important as their economic welfare; a society that takes into account the more intimate psychological needs of human beings: good relationships, inner security, meaning, self-know­ledge. This would be a soc­iety where depression, stress and alienation have become political iss­ues in the same vein as security, jobs and housing are today.

> The central idea is that by cultivating a list­en­ing society, we can not only create much happier human lives, but also dramatically spur the psychological development of larger parts of the pop­ulation into the higher stages. Such development is necessary for people to create, part­icipate in, and uphold functional societies in this increasingly comp­lex world—an endeavor that has both incredible poten­tials and great risks." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "What is the main difference between the winners and losers of history? Answer: Getting the attractors right.
>
> Whereas the amateur studies how the present has been shaped by the past to foresee the future, the pro studies how the future is already sha­ping the present. Many of the great change-makers in history, whether we’re talking about political figures such as Mahatma Gandhi or entrepre­neurs like Steve Jobs, seem to have had an intuitive understanding of the way the future exerts a kind of gravitational effect upon the present; that dev­elop­ments in the present in certain ways are pulled towards the unrea­li­zed potentials of the future. What happens in the present is namely just as much a result of what has been as what can become. Without knowing the attractors, you are destined to miss the starting gun.

> Gandhi saw the world was headed towards universal principles like democracy, human rights, racial equality and rule of law, which inevi­tably would render colonial rule ethically indefensible, even to the coloni­zers themselves. This enabled him to understand how India could be freed in a peaceful and democratic manner; he knew that history—the long-term att­ractors—was on his side. Similarly, because Jobs saw that digitiza­tion was the future, he realized before most others that everyone would want a personal computer.
>
> To those who couldn’t see these attractors, home computers or the end of colonial rule appeared as distant dreams or science fiction. More­over, blindness to attractors makes it exceedingly difficult to know what exactly to do if you actually do indulge in such dreams. With a well-devel­oped sense of the attractors you get a much clearer picture of what is poss­ible in the near future and what remains a more distant prospect.
>
> If you are able to discern different attractors from one another, under­standing their gravitational pull and intricate dynamics, you will be much more capable of successfully navigating the tides of historical chan­ge. The most astonishing and admirable achievements have rarely been made by those who set about to wrestle history and single­handedly ini­tiate a great change, and more often by those who knew the direction of the winds and adjusted their sails accordingly." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Technically speaking, an “attractor” is a patter­n or equil­ibrium that under certain conditions is very likely to emerge and stab­ilize within a dyna­mical system, such as a society. We went from hunter-gatherer soci­e­­ties to agriculture—in Eurasia and the pre-Columbian Americas separat­ely—because agriculture was an attractor. We electrified the world, be­cause electricity was an attractor. We all started using interconnected com­puters, be­cause digitization was an attractor. These things did not happen random­ly.
>
> The world is a chaotic place and the future is never predetermined; but on the general level, some things are just more likely to happen than others, and some are very likely to happen. How likely one development or another is to occur is determined by the “gravitational strength” of the att­ractors.
>
> ... We all make choices, and we take great pains to ensure we make the right ones in order to avoid our actions being completely hap­hazard. As such (given that certain choices have proven so abu­ndantly preferable to others), wouldn’t it be fair to claim that our choices, on a collective level, tend to form certain patterns that are more likely to emerge than others; that we are destined to decide between a limited range of societal models whenever they become poss­ible?
>
> After all, there are a million ways to organize society. Yet human soci­eties tend to be remarkably similar at any stage of historical develop­ment. We could organize society in accordance with the teachings of the Jones­town suicide cult, or Robert Nozick’s minimal state, or set out to make reality of Orwell’s big brother society, or make children the only electable candidates for government, or have all decisions made by rolling dice—the possibilities are endless. But for some reason most of today’s coun­tries have chosen and tried to organize themselves along the lines of a modern state or polity with a tripartite structure of govern­ance.

> ... The modern demo­cratic state is not the only attractor, but it is certainly one of the most compet­itive ones." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "What structures are most likely to survive and out­compete other structures under the currently emerging historical cir­cum­stan­ces?

>
> Such a syst­em of thought must be inherently logical, like the tripartite division of pow­­ers—or else it can hardly be sustainable as a new equil­i­brium. What you need to do is to learn to see this attractor, how it is inhe­r­ently logical, how and why it gets its competitive edge. This attra­ctor is the lodestone of the navi­gator, allowing us to blaze new paths for soc­iety, because we can see—not quite where we are going—but which dir­ections do exist: where is north and where is Mecca?

> ... Mar­x­ism has been an incred­ibly productive intellectual field for the last century and a half, but Marx’s att­empt to identify the attractors of hist­orical development was simply not satisfactory. Society did not follow the fundamental dynamics he propo­sed, nor did it develop through the stages he and his followers ima­gined. The mistakes of this theory killed about a hundred million people dur­ing the 20th century—however indirectly." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Progress is when the game of life be­comes fairer, kinder, more transparent, more inclusive, more forgiving, more sustain­able, more rational, more fulfilling. Game change is a good thing. But it is, paradoxically enough, the bast­ard child of two evils: game denial and game acceptance.
>
> ...
>
> Game Denial
>
> ...
>
> Yet, many of us frequently fall victim to what I call “game denial ”: the inability to perceive, or a negligence of, the logical and behavioral rules that regulate human relations. Game denial is when you ignore or “wish away” certain uncomfortable truths regarding human relations and how reality works. Or simply when you deny the realities of life and forcefully impose your own “ought” upon what “is”.
>
> In a subtle sense, your crime is against truth itself. And when the truth has been sacrificed for a few candy bars worth of emotional reward—people start dying as the consequences of your false assumptions begin to manifest. And from there on you are stuck with defending your lala-land from actu­ality, making things even worse.
>
> Game denial is, to this day, ram­pant. And its victims are not nec­essarily dead; it has victims in all walks of life, all scarred by unsust­ainable and un­realistic social relations, expectations and moralistic impo­sitions of “what ought to be” upon what “actually is”. Crimes agai­nst act­uality are crimes against humanity, against all life on our planet.
>
> Since game denial often “sounds nice”, it may be more convenient to def­end in a pub­lic debate (because you can easily take the moral high gro­und), but in actual reality, in a given con­text, it tends to have negative or other­wise unsust­ainable consequences. You pre­tend that the world works by rules which it does not.
>
> Game denial can show up in so many ways because life is always open to interpretation and reinterpretation. And of course, there is not one “set” game in life in which “God” crowns the winners. But the fact that life has ambiguity is a mixed blessing: It means we can make more fav­orable interpretations and save our positive self-images, but it also mea­ns the leeway to deny obvious competitions and conflicting inter­ests is huge. And because there are such strong psychological forces driving us towards game denial, we all partake in it.
>
> ...
>
> To try to eradicate the game is only a form of individual or collective repression, and it will always produce pathological results—namely opp­ress­ion. Whatever game you want to repress—like capitalism—this can only be done by activating a grosser level of game—like the game for political totalitarian power. Communist states rep­re­ssed the mechanisms of “games for profit” by playing a much crueler game for pol­itical power.
>
> But oppression is not the worst part of game denial. Oppression can be toppled; evil reigns can end. No, the worst part is that denying the exist­ence of the game means that the game cannot be described, taught and learned. The game is hidden away, made taboo. Hence, game denial is in the service of the privileged elite, making the game less fair by serving those who already know the rules and deceiving those who do not. They’ll never know what hit them.
>
> ...
>
> It’s not al­ways easy to tell game denial apart from more legitimate forms of ideal­ism. A rule of thumb, however, is that game denial very often arr­ives in the company of her twisted little sister: moralism —being subtly (or not so subtly) jud­g­­m­ental and self-righteous.
>
> The alliance between game denial and moralism works in cunning ways. They help each other staying in the back­gr­ound, so that neither has to come out in the light and get busted in all their obviousness. For inst­ance, in academia and critical social sci­ence, there is a pre­supp­osition of a pro-immigration, leftist econo­mics, rad­ical fem­in­ism, anti-mili­tarism, anti-disciplinary view of educa­tion and a few other taken-for-granted opin­ions.
>
> When you go to the liberal sociological seminars, listening for inst­ance to Judith Butler’s advanced, learn­ed and very initiated talks about femin­ism, all focus is on the spec­ifics of the argument, on the mas­ter­fully craf­ted critical social theory and research. All of this creates a thick smoke­screen concealing any number of game denials. All the left-wing game denial stays in the background and limits the discussion.
>
> There is no focus on, and no leeway to dis­cuss, all this game denial bagg­age (because it would be seen as morally wrong, and who­ever brings it up is seen as impure). The underlying moralism covers up the game den­ial. And the game denial covers up the moralism because the fact that the gam­es of life are hidden away makes the moralism appear as common sense and decency.
>
> ...
>
> Not believing in game denial and its ubiquitous presence is in itself a form of game denial. The reason people do all the game denial is often that it is a useful tool for them to win the small struggles in every­day life: for moral worth, for admiration, for power, money, sex and stat­us—or just to avoid shaming and judgment, or to have the solemn pleasure of shaming and judging others.
>
> Iron­ically, it is because people are always in a game that they can win by deny­ing its existence. Of course, there are other reasons, such as lack­ing intelli­gence or relevant perspectives. But the social rewards of game denial are part of it—and they should not be denied. It is as if many of the pro­gressive intellectuals are “bribed” by the social rewards they can attain by taking part in game denial. These are emotional and cognitive bribes that distort thinking processes, discourses and truth seeking.

> I have said that crimes against reality are crimes against humanity. But crimes against potentiality are also crimes against humanity, and aga­in­st all life on our planet—against all beautiful futures. Game accep­tance also kills. In fact, these killing grounds are far greater and more brutal than the ones of game denial
>
> Game acceptance means to prostrate before the game and take it as a law of nature in its current form, denying that the game can and must evolve. Or, more often, the game accepter holds that real and substantial changes are only ever poss­ible in a distant and irrelevant future.
>
> This makes us justify illegitimate force and injustice. It makes us think the un­fair sides of the game are somehow indeed fair, because some­one, some­­where “deserved it”. And that injustice is all for the best in the long run because it serves the game. Game accept­ance is the tune of pol­itical real­ism, “political theology” (Jean Bodin, Thomas Hobbes, Vilfredo Par­eto, Niccolò Machiavelli…), neo-liberalism, conservatism...
>
> The central principle of game acceptance is hence: That which could be is not, and hence it should not be. As David Hume warn­ed us already in the 18th century, this is a fallacy—deriving an “ought” from an “is”. That some­thing is the case doesn’t mean is should be the case.
>
> ...
>
> And just as there is an embodied form of game denial, so there is an embodied form of game acceptance. Especially those of us who have had high social status during our upbringing and reflexively assume we can win out in any confrontation that shows up can be tempted to think all such confrontations are necessarily good and just. Losers get what they deserve; that’s not just an idea, but a felt bodily experience that sets our mind up for game acceptance.
>
> ...
>
> But it doesn’t stop there. The worst crime of game acceptance is that it blocks legitimate, necessary and very possible change. The game accepter remains serial killer calm in the face of glaring injustice. If you look at the thousands of very preventable maladies that have been perpetuated by game accept­ance throughout history, you see a silent, invisible death toll looming larger than any other crime in world history.

> Should we be complacent towards obviously avoidable suffering? What the barreling fuck! Of course we could end slavery. Of course we can end animal slavery. Of course the rich world can and should support sust­ainable global growth with a significant percentage of its GDP. Of course the trade system should be fairer. Of course most wars were avoidable. Of course everyone can have free basic health care. Of course we can live less waste­fully and still be healthier, happier and have mean­ingful lives. Crimes against potentiality are crimes against humanity.
>
> Don’t Hate the Game
>
> Before we go on, I should note that neither game denial nor game accep­tance is a consciously held perspective. They are, of course, mis­takes we make because of unconscious biases and emotional invest­ments in ideas and identities (“I am a radical anarchist!” invites game denial, etc.). They constitute subtle forms of self-deceit.
>
> The mom­ent game denial and game acceptance are recog­nized for what they are it becomes apparent that they cannot be sustained. Every­one will veh­emently deny their own game den­ial or game acc­ept­ance and claim to be a responsible “game changer” if con­front­ed.
>
> ...
>
> Classical liberalism, neo-liberalism, conservatism, capitalism and fascism are all based upon accepting the game and an attitude of “may the best player win”. They are all defen­ders and upholders of in­justice, cruelty and suffering that just can­not be ethically justified. So what if I win? In a deeper sense, you have still lost. You must change the games of life. That is the only result that counts. That is the only vic­tory worth keeping, because it includes everybody. The game of life will still produce losers and winners, but the results will be deter­mined through much less bloodshed and losing will come at a much lower cost. This will be a society in which people get more than one shot at glory. Don’t hate the player, and don’t hate the game either. We need to love the game, learn to play it—and change it, because we love the play­ers.
>
> ...
>
> Thus: Let go of game denial and game acceptance—and go for game chan­ge. The idea is not to eradicate competition from life, but to trans­form and refine the nature of competition in all aspects of life: on the labor market, in work culture, in the political deliberations and elections, in the games of love, sex and family, in peer groups and in research and education.

> So again—don’t hate the player. And don’t hate the game, either. We need to love the game, learn to play it. And change its rules. Because we love the players." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Even if the study of societal development is an issue ridden with land­mines and potential misunder­stan­d­ings, it is hard to deny the obvious fact that societies somehow develop—if not to “higher” forms, if not “fo­r­ward”, at least to later stages that are more complex, richer and form parts of larger systems of exchange.
>
> ... I wish to introduce a simple but exceedingly perv­asive rule in the development of the state: the rule of increasing intimacy of control. This rule holds that the polity, viewed as an emergent pattern of gov­er­nance am­ong humans, keeps evolving in ways that increase the moni­toring and control of human behaviors by reaching into deeper layers of the human soul and putting it under deliberate, collective con­trol. We are looking at the development of social order. It is fur­ther­more, I ar­gue, this increased control that makes poss­­­­ible the civil liberties, hu­man rights and liberal culture we cur­rently enjoy. Order, freedom and equa­lity go hand-in-hand. As with all three-part marriages, it’s not always simple; but the three need each other... So, we will consider how the modern state has emerged in three sub­seq­uent stages: 1) the early modern state, 2) the nation state, and 3) the welfare state—and how we are now approaching the metamodern state, 4) the “list­ening society”. This prog­ression can be described in many diffe­rent ways, but it quite certainly follows the rule of increasing intimacy of control.
>
> ... This does not mean that whatever king is most despotic has the greatest advantage. On the contrary, the less monolithic states and rulers become more powerful because that’s how the polity successfully manages the most info­rmation, coordinates the greatest qua­n­t­ity of behaviors, and en­fran­chises the highest number of agents. The issue at hand is to build the strong­est institutions to manage such flows and to let people be produc­tive within more complex divisions of labor. In this vein, in Eng­land, you even see the birth of modern institutions such as the Royal Society (1660), to actively and deliber­ately promote science, and the Bank of Eng­land (1694) to coord­inate the monetary flows.
>
> The libertarian view, and perhaps the common sense of our time, is that free­dom grows as these developments unfold. But that’s really only half the pic­ture. It is no coincidence that this period, early modernity, is where the French philosopher Michel Foucault takes off in his studies of power and control in modern society. Writing primarily in the 1960s and 70s, his im­portant insight was to point out that control also grows as modern soc­iety progresses: that every­thing—from trade flows, to births and deaths, to bo­dies, to inner organs, to sex and sexuality, to gender, to time mana­ge­ment, to city land­scapes—becomes in­crea­singly subjected to minute con­trol, monitoring and stand­ard­ization.
>
> Even if Foucault is sometimes accused of being overly paranoid in his depiction of these developments, he wasn’t really talking about some deli­b­erate con­spiracy. Rather, Foucault simply showed that our comm­on sen­se of increasing freedom and individuality must be seen as illusory in the grander scheme of things. Today, more than ever, we are being controlled by a multitude of sources that lie beyond our conscious con­­sent—at a greater distance from us. These sources of control are much less tangible than our former feudal bonds.
>
> It is not, then, the power of the king that grows, but the volume and density of power itself that increase. Not the visible authority of one person over another, but the raw capacity to shape and coord­inate human bodies, actions and souls. Although Fouc­ault never spoke in these terms, he was descri­bing power as an emer­gent property of the self-organizing system that mak­es govern­ance of a more complex society poss­ible. And in that sense, power increa­ses as the system becomes more differ­entiated and develops more intricate social techno­logies of con­trol. The early mod­ern state en­croached upon the lives of peasants and merch­ants, beginning to shape them as cultural and psych­o­logical beings. A new stage of order emerges.
>
> ... The increa­sing com­plexity and size of the market make it poss­ible for states to gar­ner the spoils of economic growth, in turn increasing how effectively their violence can be projected—internally, against the citizens, and exter­nally, across the globe. In this period you have processes such as the creation of a national narr­ative, a heroic story (often involving, among other things, gathering ar­ound a char­ismatic leader, inventing a semi-mythic past, and sometimes killing off some poor minority that happens to st­and in the way and offer a conven­ient common enemy and/or scapegoat for mounting social and economic prob­lems), spreading liter­acy, homogenizing language and scrapping local iden­tities, instituting market laws and standard­ized court syst­ems, getting rid of large parts of corporal punishment, gra­d­­ually increa­sing the emoti­onal and economic enfranchi­se­ment of lar­ger groups into the state (vote for bourgeois men as well as conscription into the armies), i.e. tur­ning people into “citizens”. And, of course, there is schoo­ling: turning kids into pupils and pupils into citizens. “Everyone” learns to read and write.
>
> ... People download a whole mental world of “ongoing events” fitting within a greater story, shared largely by any random person you meet on the street. Memes (ideas and cultural patterns) spread more easily. Stran­gers become oddly acq­uainted by means of a new world of abstra­ctions: What is the time, what is this address, what is your nationality?—and later: What is your passport, your personal iden­tity number? The French Marx­ist theo­rist Althusser has argued that an “ideological state apparatus” comes online, one that appeals to each per­son as a citizen, which there­by “creat­es” the citizen, the subject of a state.
>
> ... Welfare and control, to a large extent, go hand-in-hand. They are two sides of the same coin. Think about it. In Sweden today, this “free” society, the state keeps almost everyone in school for twelve years, gets involved with broken fam­­ilies, brokers toxic marital relations, teaches us about safe sex, sexuality and gender equality, peers into the very cavities of our bodies: the mouth, the vagina, feeling through our breasts for cancer­ous lumps, recommends us what to eat, funds our smaller newspapers, sup­ports us in getting our lazy buts to the gym, treats our madness—if neces­s­ary, force-feeding the non-compliant patient with drugs and liquid nour­ishment. Is this level of control not approaching what George Orwell ima­gined in his novel, 1984? And yet—strangely—the people of Sweden (and other welfare states) hardly seem to mind. Sure, there are a few frustrations and scoffs at exag­gerations here and there, but by and large, people appear to feel relatively free, not oppressed nor violated.
>
> ... Rath­er, what we see is a steady expansion of social rights or positive free­doms. Social rights are, in opposition to negative freedoms, the ser­vices peo­ple can expect from society. Negative freedoms have to do with what you can expect people not to do: imprison you, stop you from going about your business, stop you from expressing an opinion, harm your body. These are human rights or civil liberties expressed negatively, by what people must not do. Positive freedoms deal with the things people are legally bound to give you, if you ask: basic education, health­care, a sub­sistence minimum. Not then the “freedom from ”, but rather, the “free­dom to ” (as many theorists of social rights, e.g. Erich Fromm, Sir Isaiah Berlin have noted). There will always be a tension between the positive freedoms and the negative ones. If you, for instance, use the forced labor of one person to give someone else a basic subsistence, it would obviously mean you have sold out basic human rights. Hence, many libertarians and conservatives have argued, we would do best to scrap the idea of social rights altoge­ther. Further­more—so the argument goes—too many social rights can lead to unreal­istic expect­ations and foster a population of spoiled brats, unwilling to and incapable of taking responsibility, lacking any industriousness and resource­ful­ness. These arguments need to be taken seriously. If we have to choose bet­ween negative freedoms and positive ones, we should opt for the for­mer. But the reality of the wel­fare state speaks its clear language: welfare syst­ems exist in all advanced societies and they seem to increase, rather than de­crease, the freedom of people. If carefully and skillfully imple­mented, they seem to subtly change the games of everyday life, leading to more progressive values, to higher effective value memes.
>
> ... Rather than dismantling or shunning this pervasive control we must make it publicly owned, talked about, transparent—full of checks and bal­ances. The issue is not to avoid any control, but to avoid bad, unscien­tific, corrupt or despotic control. We need intelligent inform­ation syst­ems—in an abstract sense of the term: not computers, even if they do play a part, but good ways of handling the huge amounts of info­rmation about which services work to emancipate us, and which ones oppress us, and who this applies to and why and under which circum­stances.
>
> ... That is what the vision of the listen­ing society promises: creat­ing an even more sensitive welfare system on top of the existing one. The wel­fare state is insufficient when it comes to match the sheer complexity of the period we are now entering (trans­national, global, post­indust­rial, digi­t­ized, etc.). We can and must make cer­tain we use these new powers to develop society. We should monitor and aid the growth of deep exist­ential relationships to reality, of our growth as citizens, of pro-social and sust­ainable behaviors, of empathy, caring and norms, of complex thin­king, of which meta-narratives we organize ourselves by. Such development doesn’t necessarily have to be organized around “the state”. We can imagine other solutions in which civil society and markets play a larger part. But we cannot avoid the question altogether: Given these greater powers of intimate control, what should we do? Most likely, this greater control will need to be developed in a mesh­work of state, markets and civil society.
>
> ... We have the possibility of creating a society in which we are happier, healthier and more of us have more universalistic values and strivings in our everyday lives. Such a society would be more stable and less prone to cri­sis—economic, political, social or ecological. It would be more resilient. So after the welfare state, the next attractor ahead is yet another major increase in the intimacy of control: a listening society where the inner lives of all citizens are supported, where many more of us reach the later stages of personal development, and where there is much less alienation, lone­liness and misery. Utopian? Yes, in a relative sense.
>
> ... It is often our highest hopes and dreams, the parts of ourselves that are most uni­ver­sal and most intim­ately held and cherished, that are not seen, heard, given recognition and successfully integrated into society. Hence, more and more people simply feel alienated. It is not really that the world has become a colder, lonelier place. It’s just that the integration of these many unique souls is a more complicated and difficult matter. Be­cause people have come farther in their dividuation, more people also feel estra­nged, lonely and subtly dissatisfied.
>
> ... you have a whole army of sensitive souls who feel unseen and mis­under­stood. Society as a whole becomes increasingly emotionally sensitive and in great­er need of more subtle, profound and complex forms of social inte­gration. When such integration fails, life feels empty and meaningless. The road to greater freedom and higher development of the self is a beau­tiful—but also tragic and ultimately very lonely—journey. As such, modern society suffers from a chronic lack of deeper and more com­­­plex forms of integration. Societal development spurs the growth into high­er stages of personal development, but higher stages of develop­ment create an increasing pressure upon society to break the prevailing alien­ation.
>

> "Nothing hurts our sense of “chosenness” and immortality more than the manifest sublimity of another’s soul. Not only that they are succ­essful, but that they are idealistic, good-hearted, high-minded and fruit­fully en­gaged in deeply significant pursuits—when we are not. That they are pow­erful in the deep Nietzschean sense of the word. That they are living their lives to the fullest—when we are not. All of us long for power in some sense; all of us are born creators. To deny this is game denial. To defend suffocating inequalities is game acc­ep­tance. To accept this game of life and to evolve it—is game change. This, I believe, is one of the greatest challenges of the times ahead: So many beautiful minds and hearts will emerge to rise to the challenges of the coming period, and so many will work—unconsciously but conni­vingly—to stop them.
>
> ... Where does it leave us then? We need to develop a corresponding level of introspective skills in as many members of society as possible. We need to be able to really look inwards. To bust our own bull­shit. We must deve­lop greater interpersonal trust, but we must also, on a pro­found level, be­come more trustworthy. We must develop self-know­ledge; higher stages of in­ner development. It is relatively easy to wish one another well, that no harm should befall our fellow citizens and peers. We don’t wish for one another to fall off a cliff—that would be terrible! But rarely do we sincerely wish for our lowly buddy to be­come the next Barack Obama. We prefer it if he gets about the same amount of happiness and success as ourselves; preferably slightly less.

>
> ... One important aspect of this training for higher freedom that is not fully caught by either Fromm or Kegan is described in­stead by the novelist Steven Press­field. In his book The War of Art, he viv­idly and intimately outlines the enemy of all artists: what he calls “resist­ance”. How many of us can truly overcome the resistance to create? Can we tolerate the empty canvas staring back at us? How many of us keep stalling our inner­most dreams indefin­itely? How many of us can bear the terror of freedom and muster the discipline and die-hard motivation to defeat the inner demons of distraction and excuse? Simple procrast­ination can also be an escape from freedom. Pressfield points out it is this denied and undealt-with inner res­ist­ance that shows up as an urge, not only to deny our own higher poten­tials, but to unproductively criticize and try to smother it in others —what I have called Sklavenmoral (and its two cronies, envy and nar­ciss­ism). So it’s not just a matter of individual inner struggle. Even at a civiliza­tional level, we are facing the onslaught of the inability to overcome inner resist­ance, which translates to envy, which translates to Sklavenmoral, and this translates to narcissism—all of which are corrosive, if not antitheti­cal, to the collective good of higher free­dom.
>
> ... And by yet another tragic and ironic twist of fate, it just so happens that we live in a digital capitalist society in which every corner and every mom­ent and every shelf is overflowing with excuses, distractions, quick rewards and new promises. How many ways are there not to lose our focus and sense of dir­ection? It’s even worse than that; it is the case that the relative success of one person’s manifested deeper potential and creative outlet easily becomes the sour­ce of distraction for others—if I am to be a successful writer, I must distract at least some of my fellow co-creators from their higher call­ings. The same goes for so many other creators. So much “amuse­ment” and “support” around, so many workshops to take and genuinely breath­taking talents caught on YouTube-clips to be shared on Face­book. Milli­ons of views. Billions of clicks. Digital weapons of mass distraction. Higher freedom from extrinsic emotional pressures must grow in pace with higher stages of inner deve­lop­ment, lest we be doomed to deceive our­­selves into new sugar­coated escapes from freedom. We must learn to disci­pline ourselves—to crack the code of how inner self-discipline is taught and acquired.

> "Which conclusions can be drawn from this analysis? An obvious one is that inequality is increasingly a global issue, and thus more of a transnati­onal con­cern than a national one. This means that economic inequality—for all its importance and for all of its harmful effects—cannot readily be tack­­­led by means of classical Left economics of redistribution within the singular state. If you raise the taxes and redistribute wealth too vigorously within one country, this does not only necessitate the exclusion of foreig­n­ers, but it also scares away global capital. Hence, we need effective global systems of redistrib­ution. In order to reach a point where serious global redistrib­ution is possi­ble, we would require a larger systemic shift to­wards global govern­ance.
>
> ... there are other ways to decrease the viscerally felt ine­quality between human beings. In fact, I would argue, that an exagg­erated focus on economic inequality leaves us with an im­pov­erished vis­ion of what equality really is.
>
> ...
>
> This is of course only one example of a wider and deeper phen­omenon of social inequality. Social capital comes in many com­plex forms: number of friends, in turn how well connected and popular these friends are, the depth and stability of those friendships, personal charm, good family rela­tions, professional contacts, socio-economic status, being “cool”, enjoying the trust and admiration of people, having sexual appeal, being respect­ed for one’s achievements, having many good stories to tell, being able to make fun and interesting events happen, and so forth.
>
> Social capital of this kind can describe both a person and a society. A person who has higher social capital is one who always gets invited, who is welcome, for who doors are always open, and who can count on the supp­ort of others. A society with higher social capital can boast greater inter­­personal trust, higher levels of solidarity and greater propensity to help stra­ngers, trust in institutions and lower corruption, greater voter turn­out, more cooperation and lesser destructive competition—and gen­erally fe­wer people who are lonely and left to fend for themselves.
>
> ... In larger human societies, social inequality can have very numerous and more com­plex causes. It interacts, unsurprisingly, with economic in­equality. If you have more contacts who trust, respect or even admire you, it becomes much easier to earn money as well. And if you earn money, it becomes eas­ier to be an interesting friend, romantic partner and so forth. But bey­ond economics, social inequality also follows the larger dominator hier­archies and stratifications of society, such as ethnicity, race, gender, sexu­ality, class, soc­ial stigma (like disabilities) and what the sociologist Bourdieu fam­ously called hab­itus , i.e. how you subtly express your stand­ing in soci­ety through gest­ures, taste, lang­uage use and so forth. It’s just easier to be a cool white male New Yorker in flashy clothes than to be a black disabled wo­man in a small town wearing Walmart clothes." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "In a listening society, the deeper welfare of the future, we can and should create institutions and structures that work against emotional in­equality—not, of course, by making the happy miserable to even out the playing field, but by strengthening our psyches so as to deal with diffi­cult emotions. We should offer good emotional sup­p­ort, training and ser­vi­ces to all citizens from the day they are born until their dying breath. If you care about the real , fundamental equality and dignity of humans, no other conclusion is possible or justi­fiable.

> ... The issue here is not to pan out all the solutions—thousands are poss­ible, with so many social technologies that must be inven­ted, implemen­ted, evaluated and refined; and the sky is the limit. The issue here is only to raise awareness of the question of emotional ineq­uality so that the poli­tical discussion can begin, and so that it can enter the poli­tical agenda." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "At a more fundamental level, access to useful and reliable information is one of the greatest consequences of economic inequality. Financially strong actors will know the markets, prices, tax evasion strategies and so forth to a much greater extent than the weaker ones.
>
> ... Hence, informational inequality works through many different mech­an­isms. One such mechanism revolves around the powers of producers and large companies over consumers, with the latter by necessity having lesser access to relevant information, thus being easily manipulated in a myriad of ways. And this dissymmetry of informational access plays out in a corres­pon­ding manner within the political arena as wealthy groups gain dispropor­tionally large political influence and misuse state institutions to pro­tect their interests, shaping media landscapes and curtailing the trans­parency of decision-making and bureaucracies. And beyond that you have the general pattern that some people thrive in the information age, being able to critically evaluate and access vast am­ounts of information and creating vibrant networks of highly skilled coop­erators, whereas the less complex thinkers and less tech­nically apt fall prey to fake news, misinformation and waste their attention, time and money on things that don’t accumulate good results in their lives. This mechanism exacerbates the other forms of inequality, where the less edu­cated and more emotionally desperate are more easily exploited." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "The same holds true, naturally, in the “meta-system” of all six forms of inequality as they interact with each other. Your access to information sets limits for your economic success, which sets limits for your physio­logical wellbeing, which sets limits for your emotional wellbeing, which sets limits for your social life, which sets limits for your access to informa­tion… and so on." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Norms regulate what is normal behavior, and thus which behaviors are repeated as hab­its...
>
> ...
>
> Norms are simple rules, injunctions, ideals and taboos that steer our be­hav­ior in everyday life, all attached with weighted penalties and re­wards. Just as there are economic incentives for us to do certain things (like get­ting a job), so there is any number of cultural incentives for us to act in certain ways, present ourselves in certain ways, or to avoid certain be­havi­ors, ideas or values.
>
> These norms are not “ethical” per se , i.e. they don’t necessarily have any­thing to do with a reasoned account of what is right and wrong. They are—with the words of the classical anthropologist Margaret Mead—that which divides the “pure” from the “impure”. As such, the norms of diff­erent soc­ieties can seem quite arbitrary or even silly to members of other societies or cultures. Some norms are more specific to cultures; in China it’s consid­ered good behavior to (gently) burp at the dinner table, for in­stance. Others are almost universal, such as the incest taboo. And they arise, of course, as a result of many interrelated factors that shape our everyday inter­actions: power rela­tions, beliefs, biological dispositions, economic systems and interests, and so forth.
>
> ... The norm system functions by doling out rewards to followers and con­ferring penalties to delinquents. It’s a delicate power balance. If you are an open homophobe in present-day Western societies, you will be punished and held back in a large variety of ways... How did this situation come about? Certain groups simply managed to win a long series of symbolic struggles, and thus started pun­ish­­ing those who violated the new norms. More and more people quickly found greater rewards in being anti-homo­phobic, and started mining this new gold mine for personal gain. And the disgruntled and outmaneuvered con­servatives on this issue learned to keep quiet. And before you know it, people changed not only their behaviors, but also their honest opinions and values. New norms took hold, and they began to shape not only the postmodern populations (many of whom were already pro-gay rights), but seeped deep into the modern main­stream and even found grudging compliance among many religious tradi­tionalists. The game had shifted, and the conservatives lost the symbolic struggle as more and more people switched sides. It’s not that people suddenly became “more enlightened”, or that they all advanced to a higher effective value meme, or that society itself became so much freer and equal (as we have seen, economic inequal­ity has even grown within affluent countries during the same period). It’s just that the norm system changed, and thus changed the behavioral incentives. And when incentives changed, people unconsciously changed their own deeply held values in less than a generation. When it comes to gradual and honest inner growth, humans are slowly awakening gods. When it comes to the shifting of norms, we are lemmings. This account may strike some readers as cynical, but it’s really just basic sociology and psychology. We know that when there are strong in­centives to feel a certain way, to adopt certain values, our minds generally follow suit... On a more mun­dane level, people will hold on to beliefs that serve their economic interests, and which procure social rewards and avoid social penalties (consider climate deniers within the fossil fuel industry). Norms follow in­terests and incentives. I’m not saying that everyone is Machiavellian. People will honestly bel­ieve that the norms that serve their (perceived) incen­tives are their own , deeply held, values. And from there on, they (or we ) will eagerly and sin­cerely defend and justify these norms. The structure of social penalties and re­wards really does become our lived, felt and embodied norms. This is how the norm syst­em funct­ions, for better or worse. The norm system itself follows no morality and no norms, only a cold logic of pen­alty and reward. But as such it can bring about norms that are more or less univeralistic, more or less functional and lead to more or less sust­ain­able consequences under the current historical circumstances.

> ... Casual observers sometimes think Scandinavian countries are “post­­­­­modern”. The truth is, however, that only a minority can be said to func­tion at the postmodern stage. What has really happened is that post­modern groups and alliances have successfully managed to influence the media and the political discourses in ways that have shaped the norm systems in these countries. Postmoderns have won the symbolic struggles.

> "Culture isn’t just, or even primarily, about being Japanese or Swedish, for instance. Sure, there are geographical and historical idiosyncrasies which shape collective habits, demeanors and so forth, as has been dem­onstrated and discussed in different ways by folks like Richard E. Nesbitt, Fons Tromp­enaars and Geert Hofstede. Culture is also, and I would argue primarily, a developmental issue. Just as there are both diff­erent per­son­ality types and stages of personal psychological develop­ment, so there are types and stages of cultural dev­elopment. And stage is a stron­ger factor than type. It explains more and it makes a much greater diff­erence. The cultures of mod­ern Japan and Swe­den have more in common with each other than they do with medieval Japan and Swe­den respectively... Metamodern politics is ultimately about building the frame­works that will evolve culture itself, that will change the games of everyday life. As an emerging global society, we must make deliberate and concerted efforts to reach higher stages of cultural development." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "The fate of billi­ons depends on a successful develop­ment of politics to match the growing complexity of the world if we are to avoid social dis­integration and ecological collapse. Modern pol­itics leaves us severely underequipped at productively addressing these new life condi­tions that technological progress, global interconnectedness and existen­tial threats to civilization bring about. The arena of national democracy is just too limited in scope, state legislation too feeble a tool, and govern­mental instit­utions too ill-prepared and uninformed to prevent run-amok tech­nologies, the unrest­rained powers of multinational companies and the continuous destruc­tion of the environment from causing immense suffer­ing and death. Politics needs to evolve. Modern society is out of its depth; its scope is too limited and its influence too shallow to develop the cultures, psych­ologies and behaviors needed to keep up with its emergent structural com­plexity." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "To be, or not to be democratic—that isn’t really the question. No, the intelligent question is the extent to which a society manages to include its citizens into the political processes; not whether a society is a democracy, but how democratic it has become.
>
> ... There is simply no conceivable reason to believe our current forms of govern­ance in modern democratic societies would be the only possi­ble and best forms of governance for all posterity. If all other forms of gover­nance have emerged in historical time, have had beginnings and end­ings, is it really a feasible supposition that liberal parliamentary demo­cracy is an exception? No, democracy is not a done deal. Why would it be? ... The fact that liberal democracy has been stably operational for a good while, that is has outcompeted its modern alternatives, such as commu­nism and fascism, and that it remains very difficult to change—even to imagine a credible alternative—can create the illusion that democracy in its current form is “the natural order of things”. But of course, it isn’t... And here’s another way of seeing it: Given the sacred status of demo­cracy, isn’t it strange that no late modern economies are mak­ing serious, concerted and patient efforts to develop it and im­prove upon its quality? By treating democracy as a given, are we not fail­ing to take our own democratic values seriously?
>
> ... If democracy is not a binary variable, not a question of either-or, but a developmental matter, a direction—can we then know and recognize its “true north”? Can we know when democracy becomes deeper, retains higher qual­ity, becomes truer to its own principles and ideals? And if we go far enough in this direction, will democracy inevitably look like “more of the same”, or will there be qualitative shifts from one stage to another that will make democracy look like something completely differ­ent, perhaps event warranting a new word? What if liberal parlia­mentary democracy isn’t “demo­cratic enough” for governing meta­mod­ern society?
>
> ... One un­deniable trend is the increasing dispersion of leadership and decision-making... Today, more people partake in decision-making at all levels of society, and wider groups of citizens can be elected. But even nowadays, the world-system, as a whole, places incredible res­pon­sibility and power in e.g. the US President, which must be viewed as a very high-risk strategy for governance. If this one person has significant flaws—as we all do—this leads to great costs for people all around the world. As such, there still remain pockets of irrationally and inefficiently con­cen­trated power in contemporary democracies.
>
> Another undeniable trend has to do with the increased total volume of active decision-making, i.e. the sheer volume of inform­ation pro­cessed by organs of governance, and the complexity of the processes deliberately shaped by governance... The point, then, is that democratic governance has come to dom­inate both greater material or natural resources, and it has begun to coordinate more human actions: longer stretches of time of people’s lives (in terms of time, effort and attention), in more minute details, playing parts in more abstract patterns of information, for more abstract shared goals. This means many more decisions must be made, much greater amounts of infor­mation organized. Hence, there is a move towards bureaucratization and digitiz­ation—anything that can cost-eff­ect­­­ively monitor and control larger quant­ities of more varied (and specialized) human agen­cy.
>
> A third long-term trend is that democracy has evolved more checks and balances against arbitrary uses of power; hence there has been an increased account­ability of decision-making. This one is difficult to spot in recent decades, as democratic develop­ment has stagnated and come to a halt. But if we look over the centuries of modern history, the pattern is obvious. There are more laws restricting the use of power, the power of office is decoupled from the office-holder—legally, if not socially—and there are greater demands for transparency and motivation of decisions made. Moreover, there are more institutions—state-run as well as in the media and civil sphere—which actively seek to uncover failures of governments, elected officials, the bureaucracy, the courts and the legal system at large. There is even an increasing number of critical soc­ial scientists who spend years laying bare problems in just one sub-section of governance, be it concentration of power in informal net­works of elites, shady conflicts of interest, or structural malfunctions that elude cas­ual obser­vers. These many forms of checks and balances increase the inter-subjective verification of legitimacy, or indeed, the inter-subjective falsification of claims to power. This does not mean that democracy functions by the same premises as does modern science, which also ideally works by inter-sub­jective verification/falsification—far from—but it suggests a vague, ten­tative approximation of the scientific ideals. This, in turn, entails that the self-organization of society gradually beg­ins to rest upon a deeper and more intricate web of verifications and fals­ifications. And even these verifications and falsifications are themselves subjected to increased scrutiny as more voices join the fray... checks and balan­ces have increased over time as democracy has grown into its current var­iety of forms.
>
> This leads us to a fourth long-term directionality; namely that demo­cra­tic participation has thickened and deepened . Even if the younger gene­ration of today appears to have a lower level of interest in public life (at least conventional politics), and even if many democratic institutions and practices have become sub­jected to diff­er­ent degrees of market logic (where voters are viewed as “customers” or “cli­ents”), largely due to the impact of the so scorned cul­tural and political currents of “neoliberalism” and “new public manage­ment” in recent dec­ades—it still remains true that today’s citizens have more venues of participation than in the past. Not only do larger groups of people have greater access to media and more time and resources to inform themselves. People also have more concrete channels of participation: in advisory boards and citizens’ coun­cils, feed­back channels for public institutions such as schools and hos­pitals, direct links by email to elected officials and a higher number of represent­atives. And then there’s a dramatic increase in the number of interest groups and civil society agents who defend the interests of many groups—from the ethnic minorities to the sports’ clubs to the animal rights activ­ists to the people suffering from sclerosis and, increasingly, metamodern groups (yay!) who seek to enhance the quality of public dialogue, and so on. Seen as a totality—and if we put the partly negative trend of neoliberal watering-down of public enfran­chisement of recent decades into a greater historical context—there can be little doubt that public enfranchisement has increased dramatically. This does not have to mean that more citizens spend their time doing things public and political; it simply means that there are many venues and that many and diverse interests crop up and organize.
>
> Lastly, a fifth long-term trend has to do with the growth of democratic culture and values . Yes, Sweden was indeed a democracy even in the 1920s and the 1950s if we consider its institutions. But in the 1920s, a hus­band could still legally rape his wife, it was considered inappropriate to speak too openly against religion, people talked to one another different­ly depending on social status and title, and so forth. Up until the early 1960s, you could beat children, not only at home but also in schools. In short, culture was considerably more authoritarian, less toler­ant, less multi-per­spectival, less egalitarian and overall less dem­o­cratic than today. If you go back to the late 1800s the issue becomes even clearer, with a ma­jority of the constituency being against not only women’s suffrage, but also against racial equality, equality of different social classes (or “estates”) and free speech... What I am getting at here is that democracy in itself is not only a mat­ter of institutional frameworks, but also of cultural develop­ment where the values, sentiments and behaviors of people can be more or less in line with democratic ideals and their collective democratic func­tion­ality. The recent rise of co-development ideals in the most progressive coun­tries bears witness to this tendency. Co-develop­ment is the process of improving the quality of de­bate, dialogue and delib­eration throughout all of society and across the political spectrum. It works from the supposition that we can’t possibly be right about “everything” and hen­ce always need to learn from one another, friend or foe; if nothing else just to see where they’re coming from. This, of course, is a deeper demo­cratic ideal and an early sign of a further deep­ening of democracy. All changes of institutional and constitutional frameworks must ultim­ately rest upon the values and cultural realities of real people. It is within this cultural realm that challenges to the existing equilibrium stage of gov­ern­ance (“liberal democracy”) can grow.
>
> Thus, I have suggested five dimensions of what a deeper democracy may entail:
>
> 1. increased dispersion of leadership; 
>
> 2. increased volume, complexity and efficiency of information processing; 
>
> 3. increased accountability and balancing of powers, putting greater demands upon the verifiability of decision-making; 
>
> 4. a deepening and thickening of de jure and de facto participation and popular support in pro­cesses of decision-making and opinion formation; and 
>
> 5. the growth of democratic, egalitarian and multi-perspectival culture and values.
>
> If you like, you can call these five dimensions a way of increasing the collective intelligence of a given society; a means to “deepen” democratic participation. In this regard, a deeper democracy is one that lets solutions of higher orders of complexity emerge and gain legi­timacy, thereby allowing for more com­plex forms of society to exist and thrive. If more real problems are solved, if public support of and consent to decisions are better, if the decision processes run more smoothly, if there are fewer unwanted and unexpected consequences of decisions made—and so on—then we can say that democracy has been developed, that it has been deepened. These five dimensions give us a kind of “true north” of democratic development, a map that can guide us towards a more democratic demo­cracy. Today’s democratic institut­ions are better than their historical pre­decessors not because they in-and-of-themselves are a God-given “corr­ect” form of governance, but simply because they fulfill these five criteria more adequately as compared to earlier forms of gover­nance.

> False Defenders of Democracy
>
> When we “defend democracy”, this can mean two very different things: We can either defend the progression and development of these democra­tic ideals and their manifestation in society (which is good)—or we may be defending the current, increasingly outdated institutional form of mod­ern “liberal demo­cracy” from the metamodern currents of renewal and refine­ment. In the latter case, we may think of ourselves as heroic defend­ers of democracy, raging against the dying of the light, but we are in fact waging a war against the core values of democratic develop­ment bec­ause we mistake the current forms of govern­ance for a sacred entity—for instance, by being overly defensive about “the constitution”. The latter is as enlightened as holding sharia laws to be the only true and God-given way of organizing society. It makes us medieval. Because democracy in its current form is seldom regarded with a sober and secular gaze, and often as a kind of sacred value-in-itself, the majority of the population may in effect be on the anti-democratic side of the develop­mental tide—much like when most folks in the past were against women’s suffrage and gay rights. Habits, outdated norms and investments in the status quo all work to uphold social inertia, an immunity to change. In this case, we end up fighting off necessary developments of govern­ance and thus of our collect­ive intelligence. The majority posi­tion, then, is that of the false defen­ders of demo­cracy. The majority is wrong. Always were. Then again, what else should we expect? The point with democracy isn’t that the majority is always right. The point is that there is a process of free and sufficiently systematized truth-seek­ing and dialogue going on for small groups to be able to pro­ve the rest of us wrong, again and again, so that values, opinions and laws can evolve and adapt. That’s how demo­cracy works—you can’t “vote” about the truth; the idea is that the truth offers a powerful attractor point so that, in the long run, more truth than falsehood will win out, and that this, on average, will have better con­seq­uen­ces. The true north of democratic development can and will lead us bey­ond the institutional forms of modern society. We are, of course, still struggling with the taboo of asking such questions, about what might lie beyond liberal democracy (with a capitalist market), because the two major alter­natives of the 20th cen­tu­ry—communism and fascism—turned out to be such terrible mis­takes.
>
> ... Fundamentally, then, governance is just another word for the self-organ­ization of society (shaping the development of people’s psychologies, who in turn consciously participate in the organization of society). To develop democracy as we know it is a way to tackle this issue of self-orga­nization. In this view, then, “liberal democracy” with its parliamentary party pol­itics is only a train station on a longer developmental railroad that has stop­ped at several earlier forms of governance. True, we have stayed here for a hun­dred years or so, which is a long time. But we stayed at mon­archic and varieties of feudal rule for much longer. And then we mov­ed on. It’s normal for the train to stop for a while. The system needs to sta­bilize and the costs of getting to the next station are high. But the train does move on, sooner or later.
>
> ... the four forms of democracy and their inter­relations: direct, representative, participatory, and deliberative democracy...
>
> Direct demo­cracy is when people—“the whole popula­tion”—vote direc­tly on decisions for laws, regulations, taxes and public pro­jects. In extension, all non-autocratic governance rests upon a found­ation of direct democracy. In theory, a population, “demos”, must be able to oust any representatives, revoke or reverse any decisions made, change any laws, rewrite any const­itution. The idea of democracy is simply that the power belongs to the people, the people being whoever is governed by a mono­polized use of force. Thus, any “in-direct” democracy must, in the last inst­ance, reference a direct democratic rule, lest it loses any and all demo­cratic leg­iti­macy.

> Representative democracy is when people elect representatives who make decisions for them (within certain designated areas of common con­cern) in “free and fair” elections. In this system, people who want to get elec­ted generally organize into lists of names on the ballot with others who they tend to agree with, and these lists are the political parties. These parties often gain a life of their own...
>
> Participatory democracy is when people—i.e. the constituents them­selves—get to participate directly in decision-making, carrying out decis­ions made, fulfill advisory functions and so forth. The idea here is to in­crease the pathways into the exercise of power, in effect broadening how many people get to really partake in governance and have a real relati­onship to the common, to the political.
>
> Deliberative democracy is democratic decision-making based upon “deliberation”, i.e. carefully facilitated discussions between the stake­hold­ers. People are invited to panels or councils and the discussion goes on in organ­ized and curated manners until some kind of common ground can be reached. The common ground is thus taken to be the decision. The idea here is that people often need to learn from one another and listen to many arguments and perspectives before they make an informed decision, and that there are often non-obvious alternatives that are not only watered-down compromises but actually synthesize different posi­tions so that a “better” position or “higher ground” is reached.
>
> ... The larger the political unit, the more complexity must be managed by means of representation—and hence the less viable direct democracy be­comes. This crea­tes an increasing distance between the governing pro­cesses and the con­stituency itself; i.e. there is by necessity a growing gap between the citi­zens and their leaders. Today it is common to talk about this phen­o­menon as “the democratic deficit”; a discussion held particu­larly in regard to the EU and other forms of transnational governance. The distance bet­ween a G7 summit and ordinary citizens, for instance, is simply so vast that it hardly can be called demo­cratic in any real sense.
>
> ... And deliberative democracy is the practice of refining the processes thr­ough which many perspectives are formed and coordinated, so that parti­cipation can be fruitful and relevant. The more stakeholders are in­clu­ded at every level of decision making, the greater the risk they clog up the relevant decision-making processes and in effect hinder the actions of one another. Hence, the issue emerges of creating smoother pro­cesses through which thoughts, perspectives and actions are coord­in­ated on a deeper and more complex level—the need for thought­fully designed, curated and facilitated processes of deliberation... deliberative democracy aims for a dis­tinct form of communication: not just “debate”, where the issue is to “win”, not just “dialo­gue”, where the issue is to “understand one another” but deliberation , where the aim is to create something new together and to find out how to do what’s best given the circumstances. If we put this table in a wider developmental context, we can see that we go from a pre-democratic state of settling issues by force, to a direct demo­cratic vote where people just arbitrarily take a majority stance, to a debate within central arenas of representative democracy, to a dialogue of parti­cipatory democracy, to the deliberation pertaining of course to delib­erative democracy. There is an inherent developmental sequence here, paralleled in part by the value memes (modern debate, postmodern dialo­gue, meta­modern deliber­ation).

> ... Democracy can never be a question of arriving at the best deal once and for all. The terms of governance and political participation must remain open to continual renegotiation to be considered truly demo­cratic, and only through processes of further democratization can the faith in demo­cracy be kept alive. Democracy, it’s not a thing; it’s a process." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> Voting Systems and Internet Democracy
>
> Even countries less democratic according to measures such as Freedom House can start from somewhere and build newer and deeper forms of democracy—even China can democratize its institutions, albeit from another starting point and through other paths than Western soci­eties. Democracy is not, as we observed, a binary var­iable. It is a graded scale pertaining to the level of collective intelligence within the systems of governance, the results of which can be measured by agreed-upon uni­versal principles, and there may be different pathways to its develop­ment. So we need to try new paths ahead for governance, until we find which forms prove effective and satisfactory, at which levels of governance, with­in which sectors, and according to which criteria. It is not a question of scra­pping representative democracy and replacing it wholesale; it is a que­stion of learning where today’s system can grow, how it can be refined, and how it can be deepened...
>
> When it comes to direct and representative democracy, you always need some kind of ballot, vote or election, and these can take on a number of different shapes, which have been explored by theorists of elections as well as in practice. For elections of representatives, the following systems all give different dyna­mics:
>
> • First past the post : You count the votes and whoever gets the most votes wins.  
>
> • Ranked voting, “instant runoff” : Voters rank the alternatives, and then you eliminate the least popular candidate until someone has 50% of the remaining votes, and then they win. Used in Ireland and Austria.  
>
> • Ranked voting, “Borda count” : Voters rank all the candidates, and whoever has the lowest score wins (you get a “1” if you’re someone’s first choice). Used in Slovenia and on some Micronesian Islands.  
>
> • Ranked voting, “Condorcet method” : Run a theoretical election between each of the candidates, until one candidate has beaten all others based on their voter rankings. To date not used in any existing country.  
>
> • Approval voting : Voters can check boxes for whom they approve of. Who­ever gets most approval wins.  
>
> • Score voting : Voters score the candidates on a scale; highest add­ed score wins.
>
> And of course, there are other possible variations. Each voting system pro­duces different dynamics and different forms of fairness, just like it is with the class­ical distinction between majority vote systems and propor­tional vo­tes. Some systems lead to more strategic voting (“my candidate can’t win either way”), some produce more compromises that have fewer strong sup­p­orters and so forth. The point here is not to discuss the implications of the different ballot systems, but simply to point out that this is another arena within which experiment­ation of democratic development is possible.
>
> In a similar vein, it should be pointed out that there are plenty of possi­bilities to explore digital forms of voting, decision making, participation and deliberation. The first idea that comes to people’s minds is usually that there could be an internet-run direct democracy, through which citizens are themselves asked to vote on different issues. In practice, of course, such a system would still need facilitation and some forms of rep­resentation, and it would likely be a poor form of governance as people would vote on many issues with little background knowledge. Looking at our five suggested dimensions of a “true north” of demo­cratic develop­ment (last chapter), it is only clear how a straightforwardly defined inter­net direct democracy might do some good in the first dim­ension. It would almost certainly be harmful to the second one, and its effect in the other three would be doubtful at best—just look down the list again and think:
>
> 1. Increased dispersion of leadership; 
>
> 2. increased volume, complexity and efficiency of information processing; 
>
> 3. increased accountability and balancing of powers, putting greater demands upon the verifiability of decision making; 
>
> 4. a deepening and thickening of de jure and de facto participation and popular support in pro­cesses of decision-making and opinion formation; 
>
> 5. the growth of democratic, egalitarian and multi-perspectival culture and values.
>
> ... The point I want to make is that there is today—thanks to the help of online tools—a significant window of opportunity to experiment with new forms of governance. Public institutions must be established with the task of evalu­ating and developing these new forms, and to spread the best practices. The research on internet democracy (or so-called “e-democracy”, elec­tro­nic democracy) and the knowledge base about online deliberation and digital citizen engagement is actually quite large—the body of research and practical experience has grown immensely since the early 2000s. With­in this tradition of research there are plenty of people with a deep back­ground in social science, theories of communication, psychology and network theory. There are some innovative thought-leaders such as Tim O’Reilly and Clay Shirky—who write about the emergent possibilities of par­tici­pa­tory online tools, as well as the transformations of digital society at large—and there are aca­demics who spend their entire careers research­ing these and similar topics, such as Martin Hilbert (but this field seems to remain with­in highly aca­de­mic circles), and there are plenty of online tools out there, such as Loom­io, Delib and GlassFrog, designed and marketed by count­less com­panies, small and large. And there are—last but not least—so many projects of online citizenship polling, petitions, deliberation and citizen feedback from all around the world, usually at the local and regi­onal levels of gov­ernance, from India to Denmark to the UK to Cali­fornia. And within party politics the Pirate Party (most famously the Ger­man one) has tried some­thing they call “liquid demo­cracy”, which is an early form of crowd­sourced online politics, and the Italian Five Star Move­ment has had elect­oral succ­esses by using simpler forms of online citizen acti­vation. The EU Comm­ission has shown sign­ificant interest in these issues, and public offi­cials are generally positive towards these trends of deep­ening demo­cracy by means of online tools.
>
> ... There must be instituted a central agency which helps to fund, develop, evaluate, as well as gather and share information about all forms of demo­cratic inno­vation—be they digital tools, new voting systems, panel and de­liber­ation programs, decision feedback systems, pathways to citizen invol­ve­ment, or con­flict resolution and mediation efforts: everything that aids the qual­ity, efficiency, reach, transparency and fairness of governance.
>
> ... As democratic society is designed today, it is simply not built to with­stand the sheer rapidity, force and disruptiveness of social and techno­logi­cal change. We have states which can change their laws as society evolves—but we do not have states with built-in mechanisms at the meta-level, where the way we propose laws and make decisions is itself continuou­sly developed . We hold democratic governance as our most cherished va­lue, and yet we fail to take it seriously enough to ensure that democracy is up­dated and rejuvenated in pace with the development of a postindustrial, digital and globalized world.
>
> ... all latter-day social science points to the simple fact that the quality of a state’s institutions has a larger impact on the sta­bility of a society, its economic development and the wellbeing of its ci­tizens than any other factor. Why is Costa Rica doing okay and Vene­zuela not? Inst­itutions... Would it be a bad idea if late modern society would expend perhaps half a percent of its GDP on ongoing serious experiments of governance? Upon conti­nu­ously cultivating and updating its own institutional frame­work? Probably not...
>
> Final Countdown for Democracy
>
> It may not be an exaggeration to claim that we are approaching a final count­down for democracy. The pressures for transnational and regional (like the EU) and global governance are simply mounting with such rapi­dity and force that we will necessarily see the growth of impenetrably thick layers of top-down governance at a supra-state level in the coming deca­des. Because all the most pressing issues are global and transnational, they must be dealt with and regulated at the corresponding level. This will place most real power at a hopelessly long distance from the common citizen of the world. A person goes about her life and casts a vote in India or Bra­zil, but the decisions governing her life conditions are made in a closed room on the other side of the planet by people she’s never heard about and may not even know exist. As things stand today, that’s where we’re headed—faster than a cann­onball. And how hard will it then not be for democratic forms of govern­ance to maintain their legiti­macy under circumstances where all meaning­ful decision-making is so distant, abstract and foreign? The clock is ticking. If the pressures for transnational solutions push us into supranational structures of governance without a corresponding re­juvenation of democratic life and participation at all levels of society, sup­p­orted by—but not limited to—new digital forms of democracy, we will come to a point at which we suddenly live in a global order that is distin­ctly non-democratic. Global non-democracy. Democracy will have died the slow heat death. It will not have been killed, simply dispersed under its own entropy, being superseded in all but rhe­toric by a global technocratic elite from which we can expect only a very limited amount of accountability. Trans­parency will be lost, and for all practical purposes, democracy will be lost—globally and, for the fore­seeable future, permanently. Again: the clock is ticking. Either we begin the slow and cumbersome pro­­­cess of continuously reinventing and updating democracy, or it sim­ply drifts away into space. If people are engaged and sufficiently em­powered to partake in governance on all levels, and live in a richly demo­cratic cult­ure, and if acc­ountability is expanded and autonomy grows from the bott­om up, then perhaps democratic forms of governance can conquer their way to the top, and we can see the emergence of a deeply democratic global order in the 21st century." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

chapter 11 beginning...

“Today we are faced with the preeminent fact that, if civilization is to sur­vive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships—the ability of all peo­ples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace”. 
—Franklin D. Roosevelt, in an undelivered add­ress for Jefferson Day, intended for April 13 th , 1945.

> "The quality of ordinary citizens’ relations with one another can make or break a country. Societies characterized by a strong sense of commu­nity, high levels of trust and mutual respect and understanding tend to be richer, less corrupt and more peaceful...
>
> Gemeinschaft Politics is about human relationships, including: those between residents in local comm­unities, cultural and sports act­ivities and other forms of volunteering in civil society, how well community builders and local leaders are treated and supported, how class dist­inc­tions play out, relations between different ethnic groups, the inte­gration of immi­grants, relations at work, gen­der relations and sexual and rom­antic inter­plays, fam­ily relations, domestic conflict and violence, rela­tions in school, how much loneliness there is, how much bullying there is, how much peer press­ure there is, cross-generational relations, social safety nets for old age and disability, the qual­ity and prevalence of frie­nd­ships, acquain­tance net­work rela­tions, distributions of social capital and status, levels of inter­pers­onal trust, levels of average inter­personal care and solid­arity, the de­gree to which people are willing to help stran­gers, norms for treating one an­other in public spaces and in general, the level of kindness and under­stand­ing people show one another, how judg­mental or forgiving we are towards each other, how peo­ple reject one ano­ther and handle norm-break­ers and del­inquents, how many grudges and per­ceived “enemies” we have, what resources there are for conflict resol­ution, which taboos we can’t talk about, how good we are at social pers­pective taking.
>
> ... We need to apply scientific knowledge to im­prove the quality of hu­man rela­tions, long-term, at all levels of society—just like Franklin D. Roose­velt said it. The value of social bonds and relation­ships is of course imm­eas­urable. Yet, besides this value-in-itself, the qua­lity of hu­m­an rela­tionships is a source of unimaginable wealth or poverty... Once a postindustrial level of affluence has been achieved, with an annual per capita GDP above 25,000 US doll­ars, the rea­s­on people suffer is no longer because of an actual lack of material resour­ces. The main source of society’s ailments is that people’s behaviors, psycho­lo­gies and social relations don’t function properly. In late mod­ern soc­iety, suffer­ing is soc­ial rather than economic. If you look at an issue like unemployment, the challenge isn’t really to feed and shelter the unemployed, but rather to provide them with social status, meaning, dignity, activities and a daily rhythm—to prevent social decay... A society in which everyone is nicer to be around—where folks are more socially function­al—and where there is greater mutual trust, would be one where people need less distance from one another and thus one of greater living space efficiency, hence with lesser living space competition, and hence with lower housing prices and rents. If you look at issues like overconsumption and ecological footprints, it is not difficult to see that a society in which people have less reason to feel insecure about their social status would also be one in which a more post-materialist culture could flourish and people could more easily make sust­ainable choices. In a society where people communicate better and are less violent, there is less reason for inter-ethnic fear and resentment to grow, and hen­ce lesser reason for discrimination, and hence lesser reason for racism and ethnic populism. It also means security costs become lower across the board, meaning more resources can be pooled into pre­ventive social mea­sures, meaning society becomes less repress­ive. When it comes to issues of mental health, psychological development, how personalities develop, the degree of prosocial behavior to be expected from a population, what per­sonal issues people have that steer their moti­vations, the prevalence of delinquency and crime—it must be obvious that each of them is shaped and defined by people’s relationships.
>
> ... In the past, a shared religion and the myth about the ruler’s divinity suff­iced to maintain a minimum of social coherence. But with the tran­sition to modernity, it became increasingly urgent that people shared the same cult­ure and language. A sense of fellowship was needed to ensure peaceful and productive relations between different classes and people from culturally distinct provinces who now lived side-by-side in crowded indust­rial cities. The nation-building projects of the 19th century can thus be seen as an early version of Gemeinschaft Politics.
>
> The modern nation state gave rise to what we commonly refer to as “civil society”; the non-governmental and non-commercial arenas where people can organize and act together in pursuit of shared interests, pur­poses and values. A strong civil society is in turn required for liberal de­mocracy to function because the arenas of civil society are where citi­zens can organize themselves in ways to ensure rulers rule in accor­dance with the will of the “people”, the “demos”. But people won’t necess­arily see, or even accept, one another as members of a demos just because the state grants them citi­zenship and equality before the law. The demos can only exist if its alleged members experience mutual feelings of fellow­ship with one an­other, and a democracy can only function if the demos feels their shared destiny is tied to the state. The state can create the legal conditions that define the formal relations between citizens, and between citizens and the state, but the fellowship needed for people to accept one ano­ther as equal mem­bers of society can only be cultivated within civil socie­ty. Democracy thus also needs a civil society because this is where its demos is developed.
>
> ... This, however, does not mean states did not play a vital role in the for­m­ation of national identities and the cultivation of civic and demo­cratic manners. It merely means that states could not develop the demos through the legal instruments of governance alone since the informal rel­ations deter­mining the demos per definition cannot be legislated about. Yet, this did not prevent the state from using other means to further the nation-build­ing project. Since civil society was where the action was, the state put great care into ensuring that civil society enjoyed favorable con­ditions to bloss­om and that the clubs and organizations that favored the national agenda received additional funding.
>
> ... Again—Democratization Politics, the poli­ticization of the development of our formal relations in the public sph­ere, must naturally be matched by a corresponding dev­elop­ment of the informal and personal relations bet­ween all citizens across all spheres of life. After all, does not each and every vote cast depend prec­isely upon the rel­ations people experience in their everyday life? Does not every debate, dialogue or deliberation depend upon the level of trust and the social skills of the parties involved? Does not the very will to want the best for not only ourselves, but for the public and for all citizens, depend upon our exper­ience of these same people we meet? Deeper democratiza­tion is only poss­ible if there is a solid foundation of Gemeinschaft . Ulti­mately, the political always rests upon a personal foundation, and this foundation is always rela­tional. We need Gemeinschaft Politics. As I have argued, for a society to acti­vely and deliber­ately cultivate and promote the quality of all human relati­ons, the personal must become a political issue. This drives us towards the frightening con­clusion that even the love affairs of teenagers are of politi­cal concern, that how many friends an average old drunk has is a political issue. It is a matter of public interest, because it affects all of us. In order for society to self-organ­ize at a new and higher level, the realm of the poli­tical must expand; the political must dive into the human soul, crawl in under our very skins. This can and will of course get creepy as hell—unless a corresponding deepening of democracy has occurred, so that it is not an expert commit­tee who subtly nudges and shapes the rest of us, but rather a free, trans­parent and fair debate is had about how citizens want to shape the gene­rative preconditions for rich and functional relations to thrive. And there are oth­er restraints that keep creepy at bay, as you will see in the coming chapt­ers. Just as deeper democracy requires deeper Gemeinschaft , so does Gemein­schaft Politics require a successful expansion of Democrat­ization Politics if it is to be in the service of higher order, freedom and equality. For now, bear with me. This is going to get creepy. But remember that this perceived creepiness is a symptom of not working with all the six dimensions of new politics together, of failing to get the new “Monte­squieu balance” up and running. If society is going to work at all in the future, we have to go deeper in our coordination of human agency and cognition, and we thus need deeper politics. All else is toothless crap. To believe that you can rearrange things without going deeper is what I call­ the position of “the liberal inno­cent”, a figure we sol­emnly sentenced to death in Book One. The liberal innocent is a false defender of freedom. Let us then go beyond the liberal innocent. Let us dive into deeper pol­itics, one that seeps into so many more relations, one that dares to go where the truth leads us: towards the intimate. Because it’s the only way ahead; if we don’t reshape human psychology, we don’t stand a chance. And in order to do so we must travel down a sensitive and risky path.
>
> ... Measures to train emotional, social and collective intelligence: The modern school system somehow expects that we figure out the most im­portant and difficult aspect of life all by ourselves: how to form produc­tive and loving relations to others. Schools put great efforts into teaching our children about chemistry and the correct use of grammar, but good social skills are more crucial to a happy and successful life as an adult. Sadly, how good we become at interacting with others is largely left to chance and many leave the education system as emotional and social illit­erates. Measures to increase the emotional, social and collective intelligence of children could include training sessions in school to successfully read fac­ial expressions and body language, guessing the hidden motivations of others, part­icipat­ing in games of perspective taking (in which you need to take others’ perspective of oneself in order to succeed), training team for­mations and task dele­ga­tion to compete against other groups in tasks of collective intelligence—and so forth. All of these interventions must first be tested in lab settings, then on populations with control groups, then in society, and then be com­paratively evaluated for benefits as compared to other meas­ures. Over time and as the expertise and implementation skills grow, there could be signi­ficant shifts in these qualities in a whole generation. Emo­tio­nal intelligence would mean more self-regulation of behaviors and less con­flict; social intel­ligence would mean people maneuver better in work and family envir­onments and have an easier time finding ways to help one another out; and collective intelligence would increase the ability of peo­ple to find their respective strengths and cooperate in more com­plex and dyn­amic patterns of teams, organizations and so forth. If such programs were succ­ess­ful, we would see an improvement of human rela­tions across the board—with gains untold.

> Organized community housing for families and the elderly: Housing in late-modern society remains sociologically, eco­nomically and ecologi­cally a deeply irra­tional endeavor... Today’s “one-villa-one-family” housing syst­­em leads to unnecess­arily large reso­urce cons­umption, to loneliness and to social, economic and physical pre­c­arity in old age, to distance between the genera­tions, to psychological press­­ure on the nucle­ar family, to dis­tance between neigh­bors and dimin­ished local communi­ty, to smaller support networks more gener­ally—and of course to higher living costs, which in turn pressures people economi­cally... The degree to which such housing projects are possible does not only depend upon the knowledge and perspectives of the people who create them, but also—and perhaps primarily—upon the average emotional and social intelligence of the population. If people generally are nicer and more pleas­ant to have around, there is also less incentives for “private islands” to protect and shelter us from one another. Rem­ember: The high costs we spend on social work, policing and sec­urity are derived from people displaying anti-social and dysfunctional behaviors. On a more gen­e­ral level, the average sociality of people—their mental health, per­sonal develop­ment and social skills—sets the limits for how the econ­omy itself functions, including core issues such as housing. One kind of Gemein­schaft Politics thus builds upon another." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

too much to quote from Chapter 11: GEMEINSCHAFT POLITICS... futire exercise - entire chapter is superb

> "The problem with multiculturalism is of course that it does not qualify which kinds of diversity are good, in what quantities, and under what circumstances. It’s just that diversity is good in-and-of-itself, which is then taken as a dogma, and it is often seen as unethical to even question this assumption: multiculturalism is good, period. This naturally leaves the field open to all sorts of dysfunctional social and cultural practices to be defended in the name of ethnic or cultural diversity, be it forced mar­riages, brainwash­ing and scaring children with de facto ghost stories, or female circumcision... On a strictly logical level, the inter-culturalist idea doesn’t really work. It emphasizes that all cultures are equal, and that each of them has a right to exist, but it is still somehow preferable with more different cult­ures rather than fewer. This leads to self-contradictions: a) If all cult­ures are equal, this means that cultures which work against multicult­ural­ism and seek to retain isolation and purity should also be seen as equal; b) if all cultures have a right to be preserved, they must also be allowed to defend themselves from subcultures splitting off, which then works aga­inst a greater diversity; and c) if all cultures should be exposed to one another, this leads to mono­culture, which often effaces cultural differences in the first place.

> TRANS-CULTURALISM
>
> Trans-culturalism is a multi-perspectival and developmental view of cul­t­ures and ethnicities; it sees all of these as being in constant flux. In a way, it is the synthesis of the three former perspectives. Cultures and ethnic identities can always be trans­formed, and they should be transformed to be the best ver­sions of them­selves, whenever this is possible without destabilizing people’s lives too much. Even if hum­ans do need cultures, shared imaginaries, narratives, histories, cus­toms, traditions and other vital aspects of Gemeinschaft —this does not mean that all current cult­ural forms and expressions are necessarily good and conducive to sustainable human flourishing, or that all combinations of cultures are mutually en­riching under all circumstances. It is an empirical matter of when cultures spur development and ex­change with each other, or when they create pathological dissonances that breed conflict, confusion, insec­urity and resentment. The answer, natur­ally, differs from case to case. And it is a matter of cultural discourse and ex­change to determine which values should—in the long run—trump which other values. Is freedom better than chastity? Under the circum­stan­ces of modern life, yes! Are human rights better than respecting the logic of caste systems? Yes. Is equality better than slavery? Yes. Is peace-loving better than war? Yes. Is gender equality better than patriarchy? Yes. Are animal rights (or some other version of caring for all sentient beings) better than anthropocentrism? Yes. This does not mean that these values should be defended at all costs, that they should be forced upon all people under all circum­stan­ces. It is simply not worth the rapid break­down of someone else’s world, or an ethnic cleansing, or an inquisition, or a Thought Police. But given the choice, given the chance, we can and should evolve cultures. Cultures have a right to exist, but it is not an absolute right. And in the last instance, all cultures will change and evolve either way, so we might as well have some ideas regarding in which direction they should develop. But that does not mean certain cultures have infinite rights to im­pose their values upon others; it just means the more universal and functional values should be allowed to win in a longer Darwinian struggle, and that such victories should be sec­ured in the least painful and detri­mental way possible. Cult­ures generally have something to learn from one another—and the aim of trans-culturalism is to make sure that this ex­change is gen­uinely enriching, sustainable and conducive to human flour­ishing... Belgium was the European country with the largest per capita outflow of ISIS fighters. But Mechelen, with a population of some 85,000, has had no such regi­stered cases. A couple of decades ago, the town had plenty of ethnic ten­sions, a large group of alienated immigrant inhabitants and grow­ing nation­alist and racist sentiments. All of this was turned around by a number of poli­cies and practices under the leadership of Somers. Initially, the city estab­lished a much stronger police presence on the streets so that people could feel safe. Hence, housing prices stopped falling in “unsafe areas” and segregation was curbed. Then, they had forceful information campaigns against dis­crimi­nation and racism, urging tole­rance and open­ness as civic obli­gations of all citizens, creating a common civic identity around such values. Then the mun­icipality officials talked the white middle-class fami­lies into putt­ing their kids back into the schools with many children of immi­grants, family by family—hun­dreds of them—by giving them speci­fic guarantees of how the quality of their kids’ education would be preser­ved. Then they put higher pressure on dysfunctional immigrant families to fulfill their social obligations and live up to their increased status in society, offering to supp­ort the civic actors who played important parts in this. And then—this is where it gets really radical—they sent Muslim kids on special study trips to Córdoba, Spain, where they learned about the era when Islam was a digni­fied Euro­pean power and Córdoba was a center of science and tolerance, a multi­­cultural society ahead of its time. The kids were thereby presented with a positive narr­ative of what it means to be Muslim: to be a pinnacle of enlightened civ­ilization, as the Caliphate of Córdoba was in the 10th century AD. You see what they did there? Mayor Somers and his crew took a major­ity culture and pushed it towards tolerance, and they took a minority cul­ture and gently pushed for its transformation in a progressive direct­ion. That’s trans-culturalism in action, and it is also the beginnings of meta­modern Ge­meinschaft Politics—and the beginnings of the listening socie­ty. How cool is that? All of this is an example of what smart Gemeinschaft Politics might look like. Imagine if what Mayor Somers is doing was already part and parcel of how societies diffuse ethnic tensions. And could it be further deve­loped? Maybe there could be meeting places and settings that provide facilitated exchanges between different ethnicities? Wouldn’t that drama­tically improve society, lessen ethnic tensions and create a firmer basis for a transnational global community? Yes, it’s an increased level of the inti­macy of control. But is it oppre­s­sive and mani­pulative? Or is it just con­structive and liberating? Should socio­logical, cult­ural and ethnic issues really be beyond the scope of the political realm? Stupid forms of Gemeinschaft Politics will be nationalist, non-nation­alist, or inter-cultur­alist. Smart Gemeinschaft Politics will be trans-cult­ur­alist.

Right, so if you think you can create a good and healthy society without dealing with what I will here call “the gender-sexuality-family-formation complex ”, (to catch all of these interrelated issues under one banner) you are just not being realistic. Gender and sex issues are at the very heart of society. If you mess them up, you mess up society in very profound and far-reaching ways. Any Ge­mein­schaft Politics worth its salt should actively and deliberately seek to heal and develop the gender relations of society." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Well, for starters, existential angst or deep-felt alienation is hardly more private than drug abuse or domestic violence. How our fellow citi­zens are feeling deep down concerns us all whether we like it or not. Stun­ted personal growth makes its way into crime statistics and suicide rates; the angry kid who steals your car, your neighbor’s daughter with a belly full of valium.
>
> Secondly, let’s have no illusions about the separation of church and state. It’s not that govern­ments suddenly realized it is wrong to meddle in the exist­ential affairs of citizens. Traditional religion was simply abandon­ed in favor of new sacraments that more effectively could shape the spirit of people in the modern age: “the altars of television”, through which the daily sermons of saintly news anchors help us make sense of an otherwise con­fusing world; “the pulpits of university halls”, from where a new clergy of intellectuals preach the gospel of science and liberal democracy; “the cath­edrals of fine art and culture”, in which the prophets of artistic ex­pression seek to expand the boundaries of the human soul; and “the holy church of sports”, whose zealous devotees from various congregati­ons carry out the divine mission of boosting national morale and strengthe­ning the character of school children. All of these sacred institutions of modern­ity have form­ed close ties with the state, and the overall purpose has largely been of an existential nature: to offer a firm foundation of meaning­fulness in people’s lives, credible narratives about reality, some­thing to believe in—faith, in one way or the other.
>
> That we live in a fully secular society is and has always been a myth. As such, the intelligent question is not whether existential matters should be political concerns or not. They already are. Rather, the question is why we shouldn’t have a more explicit discussion about how the instruments of politics are used to shape our relation to existence, and why we shouldn’t make it a deliberate goal to support the personal growth of as many as possible?
>
> It would thus make good sense to have a Ministry of Existential Aff­airs whose purpose should be to monitor, understand and affect issues pertaining to the existential foundations of everyday life—in sensitive, res­pect­ful and transparent ways, of course—so that more of us can dev­elop fruitful ways of relating to life.
>
> Thirdly. Is the spiritual wellbeing of ordinary citizens really so far be­yond the scope of any quantifiable inquiries that we will never be able to make informed decisions about how to improve upon it? I don’t think so. Useful data about how we, as a society, are doing deep down, how we relate to the ultimate issues of life, could be gathered if we began to ask the right questions, such as:
>
> • How many people honestly feel they are following their dreams? • How many are tormented by the existential crisis that seems epidemic to early adulthood, and how seriously?   • How many and how fundamental lies do we tell one another? To what extent do we live with truths that cannot be told to our nearest and dear­est?   • How large inconsistencies and sources of self-deceit can be detected in our moral reasoning and actions? • How many of us do things that are counter to our moral intuitions in our professional lives?   • How many of us feel a pervasive lack of meaning?   • How afraid are we of death, and how does this fear shape our lives?  • How many have strong, transformative experiences of a spiritual nature, and how often, and who?  • How many of us feel genuinely identified with the ecosphere, future gen­erations and the animals?  • How many people get stuck in untreated traumas, so that deep wounds are never healed and greater inner depths never fully integrated into our personalities?  • How many live our lives with a nagging sense of anxiety in the background (Book One: subjective states 6 and 7) and how many live with a general sense of safety and basic goodness (subjective state 8)? • To what extent do we define ourselves, our identities, in terms of material wealth and worldly success versus in terms of inner qual­ities?• How do we reason about the highest ethical principles and how do we relate to paradoxes and dilemmas?  • How many of us are on serious spiritual paths, or otherwise trained in introspection, meta-cognition, inner self-scrutiny and useful forms of med­itation?  • How accurately and dispassionately are we able to describe our own be­haviors, strengths, weaknesses and vices?  • How many of us have profound regrets on our deathbeds?
>
> Inquiries like these could be conducted in a sound, scientific manner just like we nowadays routinely survey overall life satisfaction and happi­ness, what people consider most important in life, whether reality meets our expectations, and so on. So in the same way we have national age­ncies to gather and publicize statistics on economic perfor­mance to ensure infor­med decisions are made within the departments of finance, a census bureau of Existential Statistics could be establis­hed to pro­vide the Minis­try of Existential Affairs with much needed data about how we’re doing—how we’re really doing, deep down.
>
> Truthfulness, bravery, inner self-discipline, spiritual well­being, self-know­ledge, existential ways of relating. These are im­portant things, in and of themselves for each person, and for society as a whole. Am I overstretching here? Is this too much to ask of our society, that we together should relate to these questions? I don’t think it’s too much. I think it would be profoundly irresponsi­ble for us, as a global civilization, to enter an epoch of such towering com­plex challenges and hitherto unimaginable techno­logical powers to gene­rate suffering and bliss, without properly addressing these issues in a wide-reaching and systematic manner.
>
> ... But it is a simple fact—despite the pervading sense that we are bu­sier than ever—that many or most of our daily activities and life goals are quite poor­­ly thought-out, rather shallow, and often quite unneces­sary. We pur­sue shall­ow life goals, because we get stuck on relati­vely sim­ple and basic inner needs that still “have us by the balls”. The goals of our actions are themselves “ineffective” (transrationally speaking), our motivations and drives hardly con­ducive to sustainable human flourish­ing, development, love and last­ing happi­ness. And in these days of expo­nentially growing human power, the failure to pursue deeply worthwhile goals in as many people’s lives as poss­ible, can and will be nothing short of catastrophic.
>
> ... Just as a society will have a certain GDP growth over a period of years, and just as every society repro­duces its murder and suicide rates with frightening precision from year to year—so must every society have a spe­c­ific number of shattered dreams, a number of broken hearts, a percen­tage of lifetime spent in subtle self-doubt, a number of crises suc­cess­fully passed (or not), a num­ber of psychological stage transitions that occur harmon­i­ously or in wren­ching agony. Is it unreasonable to ask how each of these num­bers can be studied and improved upon? That’s Existential Politics: reducing the number of shattered minds and broken souls while increasing the number of inner phoenixes rising.
>
> ...
>
> This would be the *meta*-modern mission: to create a deeply self-reflective modernity; a modernity operating not only upon nature and the environ­ment, but one that reexamines its own perspective, its own choi­ces—if you will—its own soul. Modernity did peer into the soul of individual human beings, under the auspices of psychiatry. But it never developed a full process for look­ing into its own existential foundations and to treat the maladies of civili­zation.
>
> ... The point is that it is only by seriously helping people to get what they really need and want from life—by supp­orting serious adult devel­op­ment, development of the mind and the per­sonality as a whole—that we can raise the level of behavi­oral functioning through­out soc­iety and the level of mental health through­out all social groups.
>
> ... The point is that literacy is a whole world, a whole continent. It’s not this “one thing” that can be “implemented” and should or should not be done 20 minutes per day. And yet, literacy is fundamental to our society. To metamodern soci­ety, meditation—contemplation, introspection, phenomenological ex­plo­­ra­­tion—is that fundamental. The human mind is running haywire and diving right into a global super-nano-robotics-AI-bio-digitized eco­nomy galore, and you want to leave our minds unchecked, unexamined and without pro­per tools for self-scrutiny and self-knowledge? That, my friend, would be as crazy as trying to run a modern society without lite­racy and arith­me­tic. Meditation is that fundamental. It’s self-observation and self-reflection, a higher layer of self-organ­i­zation. If we had told a peasant in the 1700s that their children should stop wor­king the fields to go learn something called “chemistry” and “phy­sics” by looking at letters and numbers, this would indeed have seemed very abstr­act and as a waste of time. To the modern mind, investments in dev­eloping the inner world necessar­ily appear wasteful and frivolous in a correspond­ing man­ner. Not only is the modern mind focused on outward progress and achie­vement, but its very sense of reality is built around intersubjective verifi­cation. Hence, turning inwards to what cannot be seen and shown in the inter­sub­jective realm appears as a way of turning away from reality itself.
>
> ...
>
> So what is integrity? It’s not how honest and steadfast you are. Those are only surface phe­nomena indicating a deeper structure of the psyche. Here it is:
>
> • Integrity is a measure of how and to what extent the different parts of your psyche—be it thoughts, beliefs, emotions, ha­bits, reflexes, ass­um­ptions, percep­tions, evaluations, intentions, motives, or identities—con­tradict and undermine each other, and/or how well they rein­force and strengthen one another.

> • Integrity is the measure of how well your psyche is integrated.
>
> ...
>
> But the point is that—even as these things are indeed often based on lies, even if they are conceited and steeped in falsehood—they are still the great­est values of existence: the true, the good and the beautiful. Due to our coll­ective existential immaturity, however, we perpetuate a situati­on in which peo­ple’s strivings for these noble ends cannot be trusted. This exist­ential imm­atur­ity is not an eternal or necessary quality, how­ever; it is some­thing that can and must be challenged and outgrown. And it’s not binary; thr­ough contemplative practice, self-knowledge and self-accep­tan­ce we can reduce the grip that ego identification has on all of us. It’s a scale — and to­gether we can climb the scale towards higher collec­tive freed­om." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "As I have pointed out several times already, it is insufficient to simply denounce all holism and deeper integration as totalitarian and cast our­selves as defenders of freedom, pitched against “those control freaks”. As soon as people get what they want and enjoy freedom, new things emerge and thus complexity increases; and as complexity increases, there is a re­newed need to coordinate behaviors and organize things—and that’s con­t­rol, whoever or whatever system may instantiate and exercise it. Higher freedom is paradoxically married to greater and more intricate forms of con­trol. If you throw out all complex coordination of behaviors, you don’t get absolute freedom, but simply fragmentation and alienation; things pain­fully fall­ing apart. That being said, society must counter its processes of governance and integration with corresponding and principled defenses of the singular per­son, her uniqueness, her lived experience, her rights. In modern liberal democracies, this is guaranteed by the rule of law and independent courts—in theo­ry, powerful citizens can­not tram­ple even the meekest beggar because her rights will be prot­ec­ted by the courts. In theory.
>
> ... In short…
>
> a) as society’s complexity increases, 
>
> b) this also creates pressures to increase the reach and density of governance, 
>
> c) and this creates new sources of oppression (both the increased complexity of society at large and the new layers of governance), 
>
> d) and this creates an increased need to expand negative human rights and freedoms, i.e. the right not to be subjected to a host of new oppressions, 
>
> e) and as these new negative rights must be of a subtler and more abstract nature, they will be harder to define, defend and make sound and socially sustainable, 
>
> f) which thus makes necessary an ongoing political process through which information is gathered, rights and obligations are perpetually discussed and tested, and new institutions are created in order to defend people against new forms of oppression. 
>
> And that process (point f), is Emancipation Politics. It’s not a binary “thing” that you can do to “guarantee freedom”. Peop­le aren’t either free, or not. As we have noted, freedom is a scale, both at the level of the single person and for society as a whole—and it develops together with order and equality. Even new (in)dividuation will eventually lead to new forms of oppression. And since society’s dev­elopment is full of uncanny paradoxes and con­tradic­tions, it is unavoidable that efforts to improve the human condition can and will create new forms of oppression. The point is that this emer­gence of new oppression should be preempted in the best possible manner and be made visible and a subject of public debate and political agency. That’s what would be going on at the Ministry of Emancipation : All forms of oppression that people experience in their lives would be gath­ered as data and analyzed. There would be public discussions about the inter­pretation of these data, and there would be an ongoing debate about what can be done to defend people, according to what rights. Human rights will no longer be enshrined and taken as religious absolutes, but be recognized for the social constructions and social deals they really are. What rights do you have, and whose obligation is it to uphold these rights, under what cir­cumstances? This will become an ongoing and central dis­cussion in meta­modern society. Just as a key difference between modern and metamodern society is that in the former, the system of governance is a given, and in the latter, it is an ongoing developmental process, so it is with human rights and civil liberties—in modern societies these are seen as nat­urally given and immu­table background variables, in the latter they are seen as a productive field of expansion, development and critical re­straint. This is human rights re­loaded.
>
> In today’s society we are already slipping into this redefinition of rights within many areas: culture wars, identity politics, issues of migration, ex­pensive health­care (do we have the right to medications that cost milli­ons, if these save lives?), nud­ging, environmental impact, basic in­come, free speech and false infor­mation; all of these seep into every part of politics and the media—who has what rights, who is oppressed and in what ways, and who has what oblig­ations. But as things stand today, there are only weak and haphazard inst­itutional frameworks for dealing prod­ucti­vely and syste­matically with these issues, which results in a host of pathologies: liberal polit­ici­ans pur­suing un­tenable expansions of peo­ple’s “rights”, single court deci­sions getti­ng too much power over major societal issues, people being att­racted to extremist positions on both ends of the political spec­trum.
>
> Our societies need a “human rights 2.0”, an ongoing updating of which rights apply in which contexts, and an ongoing cultivation of frameworks which counter any new forms of oppression that may arise as society pro­gresses into a metamodern stage. Consider this: You have the “great stretching out” of value memes, i.e. more people encountering one ano­ther across all of the different value memes than ever before, under the increased ability to monitor and control one another, not only technologi­cally but also psychologically. Do you really think that a static set of given “individual rights” can and will protect everyone from oppression in all of its forms and guises? That would be a terribly naive belief... The cultivation of such Emancipa­tion Politics—and the gathering and coordination of eman­cipatory and libertarian forces of society—is a nec­essary counter­weight to the integrative forces of the other forms of poli­tics. Gemeinschaft Politics, Existential Politics—just imagine how wrong these things can go. And yet, necessary they are." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

too much good stuff in chapter 15 as well - lots of good stuff isn't in these quotes

> "If making society as em­pirically solid as possible was an easy or obvious thing, we could “just do it” and be done. But since it is such a highly ab­stract and difficult thing, we need a wide-reaching process through which differ­ent paths to val­idity, reliability, consequentiality and truth­fulness are suggested and tested ag­ainst each other. We need to perpetually answer and re-answer questions about practi­ces in society...
>
> For example, which kind of didactics should be used for which kids in school when they learn to read? Given that we can agree on some basic aims (high infor­m­a­tion reten­tion, concentration, good reading speed, good aware­ness of one’s own reading style, etc.)—it’s an empirical quest­ion. How should we use pol­icing and social work to reduce crime rates? Empirical question. What level of social welfare optimizes security with­out being financially unten­able? Empirical question. How do we improve the quality of demo­cratic delib­eration and the average political engage­ment of citizens? Empirical question. How do we reduce the level of false infor­mation and increase people’s ability to critically evaluate sour­ces of infor­mation (as well as one’s own beliefs and presuppositions)? Em­pirical que­stion. You get the idea. The core issue of Empirical Politics is how to optimi­ze the process of getting the best possible empirical knowledge and to get all parts of society to commit to using that knowledge. And that, my sus­picious friend, is far from a no-brainer.
>
> The societal value of empirical science and knowledge cannot be over­stated. Even if we get a deeper form of demo­cracy, people will still need to base their shared decisions upon as sound evidence as possible. The whole point of having a better decision-making process is to come closer to a shared truth; so in the last instance you will still be dep­endent on evalu­ations, cost-benefit analyses, facts, second opinions, addi­tional tests and so forth. What does “an opinion” help, or someone’s “feel­ings” for that matter, if the facts speak against it? Should we treat people with vaccines? Are GMOs dangerous? Are the Jews conspiring ag­ainst our race? Does im­pri­sonment of convicted criminals help; if so, whom, how and under what circumstances? Whatever feelings or gut react­ions we may have to­wards these issues, it is in our common interest that the most valid and reliable data are pro­duced, presented and rigorously (but not conclusi­vely) inter­preted for us.
>
> ... Like­wise, more and more of decision-making is dele­gated to meritocrat­ically selected but unelected ex­perts, consultants and technocrats. In a way, then, such soc­ieties are al­ready slipping into an early form of Empirical Politics—often, however, partly at the expen­se of demo­cratic legitimacy and transparency. As the systems of governance are tasked with tackling greater complexity and more issues that require technical detail, they tend to slide towards tech­no­cracy.
>
> Empirical Politics is the process through which the long and tricky path to a scientifically sound society is discovered and traveled. It should be obvious, after all, that today’s society is still largely unscientific : Massive institutional practices are kept alive without a shred of evidence for them being the best alternative, most peo­ple are relatively poor at sci­entific reas­on­ing and critical thinking, and the poli­tics of the major parties are largely based upon loose “opinions”. Most of life goes unex­amined (Socrates turns in his grave) and the unexamined life gets away with it—most fatefully, per­haps, the criminal justice system. Given the very power­ful tech­nological forces that are about to be unleashed upon the world, the fail­ure to seriously up­grade the level of sci­entificness in society is danger­ous, bordering on sui­cidal.
>
> ... What could be a wilder ride than to align society with the verifiable regu­larities of the cosmos? After all, scientific discovery always surprises us in so many and so earthshattering ways. If madness is civiliza­tion’s sha­dow, our only hope for sanity may lie in increasing our ability to cross­check and fals­ify the proposi­tions of one another. It’s not obvious and it’s not naive.
>
> ... the fundamental feature of modern science is inter­sub­jectivity , meaning that science progresses by the act of people verifying or falsifying the findings of one another. Is there an elephant in the room or not; or a rhinoceros, as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein once discu­ssed in a Cambridge office? Do you see it too? By what method can we reasonably find out? How sure can we be? And have we asked the right question to begin with? All of these quest­ions each offer a step at which others can come in and burst our bubb­les and perhaps convince the audi­ence that we are wrong—even showing ourselves that we are mistaken.
>
> ... the level of scientificness of society can only be measured by the density and complexity of the meshwork of intersubjective verification and falsi­fication . Fundamentally, that’s what it means: the degree to which we—collectively as a society consisting of a network of people referring back and forth to one another—manage to check, double-check and triple-check the information, suppositions, methods, claims and ideas of one an­other, and the quality, efficiency and systemic optimization of said checks. A peer-reviewed society? Yes, why not—given that the peer-review system itself is criticized and upgraded... Truth is not due to your intelligence or the honesty of your beauti­ful soul. It depends on how hard and often and fairly and efficiently and rig­orously you are check­ed for bullshit and mistakes, and how often and well those that check you in turn are checked themselves, and how often the check­ers of the checkers are checked—and so on. The finer and more opti­m­ized and har­monic this resonance of inter­subjective verification and/or falsification is throu­gh­­out society, the closer society is to the truth.
>
> Is our present society close to the truth? To get an idea, we can take a look at the field of science itself. There are about 50 million pub­lished “sci­entific” studies at the time of writing, with about 2 million being add­ed every year. On average, only 40% of these seem to produce rep­licable results (and that varies across fields; social psychology is dismally low). And if you look at how many of these research findings are “trian­gulated” (mean­ing that you can see the same finding by use of another, indepen­dent method, as to avoid any biases due to your way of meas­uring), you under­stand that much of science amounts to rather faulty towers. Critical social science and hum­anities are even worse off. Of all papers published in the humanities, in peer-reviewed journals, only about 20% are ever cited. The rest just pile up. Many are only ever read once or twice; whole careers go on like that.
>
> We seem to have reached a systemic limit in terms of sheer “know­ledge prod­uction” . As an emerging global society we need to start think­ing about how to corroborate and solidify knowledge, how to make it tra­vel across discip­lines and social settings so that it lands in the right place, how to invent new applications and combinations of knowledge—how to in­crease the quality of knowledge in a general sense. Most likely, this would involve lowering the (relative) number of pure researchers and in­creasing the auxiliary professional functions.
>
> The fact that science and truth are shaky is a serious matter. The great­est terrors and the darkest nights of history are born from jammed infor­m­ation feedback syst­ems, when glaring truths are systematically supp­ress­ed and ignored. Com­munism, fascism, the animal slavery of today—these evils are, funda­men­tally, direct consequences of unchecked hypoth­eses, of terrible trans­figur­ations of the processes of truth-seeking, of intersubjecti­vity vio­lated.
>
> From an informational perspective, the very reason democracy works (somewhat) is the same reason science works in the first place: It allows for ideas and claims to be intersubjectively scrutinized and check­ed. The developmental direction, in terms of attractors and “relative uto­pia”, could not be clearer than in this case: The society of the future, meta­modern soc­iety, must be a society closer to the approachable but always unattainable truth.
>
> ... Some societies are more empirical than others. Which ones? It’s an em­pirical question. How do we find out? It’s an analytical question. How do we organize a process of finding out how to be more empirical? It’s a poli­tical question.
>
> ... this process of “truthing” society relies not upon doing what this or that “des­ig­nated smart person” thinks, but by increasing the overall capacity of soc­iety for inter­subjective verification... Each of us are very limited in scope, time, attention, patience and capability, so in almost everything we “know”, we must rely upon the expertise of others. In any and all matters where such expertise does not exist, is scantily clad, or where enough people dispute it, we’re simply left guessing. And still we manage to believe ourselves while we’re making all these horrendously unqualified guesses!... Science outside of the research itself is fundamentally a reference system , and if enough distrust polarizes civil society at large, it will frac­ture what­ever can be seen as “scientific consensus” as well... We are far, far, far away from a truly scientific society. We are medieval.
>
> ... I’d like to mention ten categories of things to do...
>
> Numero uno : The Ministry of Empirical Politics would evaluate, sur­vey, rate and publicize the degree of evidence-based practice in all areas of pub­lic sector work and civil service. This would include every­thing from edu­cation to healthcare to social work to policing and forensic practices to envir­­on­mental protection to all of the other forms of politics that we have mentioned thus far. What can be shown to function in a replicable man­ner, and what cannot? How can big data be accumulated and analyzed in each of these cases? In which areas are we driving in the dark? Together with people on all levels of society, the ministry should also be charged with mak­ing plans for how to improve the empirical rigid­ity of what is going on. Step by step, all public activities should become more know­ledge-driven and well-infor­med—meaning they should be intersubjecti­vely scrutinized, again and aga­in.
>
> Number two: Empirical Politics would aim to improve the quality, rel­evance and reliability of science, throughout all branches. It is an uncon­tro­versial fact that univer­sities and other institutions generally function far from optimally. Society as a whole has a lot of science out there, and this entity, viewed as a massive entirety of enough frontiers to explode any human brain, can of course be more or less efficient, well-coordinated and in line with human needs and goals. It’s not just a question of how much funding science gets; it’s a question of what level of quality science—this most crucial of society’s projects—has. There is a lot of low-quality res­earch that is just too sloppily made, made for show, never re­prod­uced or double-checked, and simply never read by anyone. And there is so much stuff which needs to be done but never is, “because we don’t have the res­ources”. Science and research of course require a good amount of auto­nomy to function: Naturally, we want evidence-based policy, not poli­cy-based evidence! But even that is a question of Empirical Politics: If we want a society informed by the best possible knowledge, how do we make certain that such knowledge is produced autonomously and reliably?
>
> Number three: a cultivation and development of the critical meta-dis­cussion about science and its role in society. Basically, if we are to have a society where things are always evaluated against the benchmarks set by scientific inquiry, we should better make certain that science as a whole and our “politics of science” are properly critiqued from as many and sys­te­matic angles as poss­ible. This is where activities such as the philosophy of science, the soc­io­logy of knowledge (and of science, and of philosophy), applied cognitive science and the discipline that is sometimes called “soci­al episte­mology” (pioneered by Steven Fuller) are granted plenty of res­our­ces and a central role in society. This concerns such things as seeing which trends and norms are dominating within the scien­ces—and why—and how this spills over into society at large; or how politics and econo­mic interests may be undermining the autonomy and validity of science; or how certain sciences unduly get more resources and attention than others; or how certain research programs may be built on shaky pre­mises in the first place; or how certain ethical codes are not being observ­ed… You get the picture. There’s really no limit to how deep you can go on this one. Under the umbrella of all projects we think of as “sciences” (and huma­nities) there is just so much crazy and unfair and irrational tunnel vision stuff going on that we must make certain there is a proper crit­ical discuss­ion about science-in-society. Science is not a straightforward affair, some­thing “obvi­ous” that you can “just do” and then “get know­ledge”. It never was and never will be. New questions always arise: what is worth knowing, why, and how highly should it be prioritized, and by what processes should we decide, and how should the research be organized… Tough questions... Science isn’t too sacred to be scrutinized: It becomes sacred thr­ough scrutiny...
>
> Number four: We should increase the number of networked contacts and exchanges between the scientific fields—there’s that magic word inter­disciplinarity (or crossdisciplinarity)—as well as between the sciences and the industries, both private companies, social entrepreneurs, the pub­lic sec­tor and other agents. You may recognize this line of thinking in eco­n­omic geography, where people study things like innovation clusters, triple-helix models (the synergy of university, business and city admini­stration) and incubators for high-tech industries. The point is that if an economy spec­ializes within some branches of science in the global know­ledge economy, say solar power or nanotech, it should also try to create pathways to putting this knowledge into the right contexts and uses. Science is one thing, scien­ce-in-society is another; it’s the rich ecosystem that feeds upon the juices of discovery and in turn creates fertile soil for further research. Not only should science be improved upon and opti­mized, so should science-in-society. These knowledge ecosystems should be improved upon, and that requires smart Empirical Politics.
>
> Number five: increasing the average ability for critical thinking and logi­cal reasoning in the general population. There are, natur­ally, many ways of doing this. One way is standardized tests in schools that include techni­ques of “fooling” the minds of students, so that they must be con­fronted with how they bought into an illusion, an apparent surface pheno­menon or a case of downright trickery. Creative projects that cultivate the public’s logical and critical thinking could be funded, e.g. by means of prize con­tests and so forth. Coaches in logic and critical thinking could be educated and be em­ployed as teachers or advisors within many fields. If more peo­ple iden­tify as crit­ically minded and “logical”, this will make such norms more pervas­ive—and hence quackery and false inferences will be more difficult to get away with within all fields of society. Not only should more peop­le be more apt at busting bullshit arguments—this being a skill we generally lack to a truly deplorable degree—but more of us should cultiva­te a deeper search for truth. This includes increased inner self-awareness; that we are trained, for in­stance, to catch our own minds making false im­plicit infer­ences... It has been shown that it is not enough to inform people of our own biases; we must be actively trained to catch ourselves before such biases curtail our reasoning...
>
> Number six: the founding of crosschecking media institutes. When Pre­sident Macron wants to combat disinformation and fake news, he is not entirely off mark. But the way to increase the reliability of the media and the general discourse long-term is through cross-referenced re­views of the qua­lity of reporting and journalism. Media outlets, journalists and writers should be checked for factuality, reasoning and presentation and be given rates and rankings. Low quality journalism should not receive public supp­ort. Again: a peer-reviewed society. How to do this in a depoli­ticized, fair and “objective” manner is a question of Empirical Politics. May the best suggestions win.

> Number seven : the support of a co-developmental political culture. We don’t want the sneakiest and most loudmouthed to rule us and gain power; we want the best possible common truths and solutions to emerge through the rich processes of competition, understanding and deliberati­on. So we need our political culture and debate to take on more civil and respectful forms. There is a tendency in all of us to admire the dashing, the confident, the winners of exchanges of clever retorts. But in an advan­ced and complex society, such competitions are little more than a signal inter­ference in the information-processing that makes up society’s self-organi­za­tion. We need to find ways to develop beyond it, to develop poli­tical culture itself; from snide remarks and sly competition, to earnest co-dev­elop­ment. I’m not saying it’s easy, I’m say­ing do it or die trying.
>
> Number eight: We could support the development of popular culture in an empirically correct direction. Whereas the arts must always remain free, it should be noted that blockbuster movies and popular outlets play a crucial role in forming people’s background understanding of reality. If physics and history are presented with glaring faults in movies and books, this certainly affects the overall level of realism that can be expected from the public. Efforts could be made to support the proli­feration of more fac­tually correct stories. If people are soaked in prepos­terous movies 24/7, should we be so shocked that many don’t react when leading politicians deny climate change?
>
> Nine: the development of the precision and reliability of everyday lan­guage. Since so much of our lived and shared reality is mediated through language, many of our political problems, conflicts and misunderstand­ings stem from linguistic imprecisions and the vagueness of words. It could be a long-term project to make language more coherent, exhaustive and pre­cise. It’s one of those things that’s almost impossible to measure, but the impact of which must undeniably be vast.

> We really need to kill off all the excuses our lazy minds can come up with for not being scientific and committed to truth. I am not proposing scien­tism or crude reductionism; I’m talk­ing about finding the best pos­sible explanations and solutions and using them in all parts of society. There isn’t a place in the world, not even within the arts, psychedelic trips or spirit­uality, where the truth has no relevance... The point is to gradually increase society’s capacity for info­rm­ation processing and event prediction by developing our collective capacity for intersubject­ive cross­­check­­ing . This must happen at all levels of society... Empirical Politics is the cult­iv­a­tion of our shared commit­ment to an honest exploration of the mysteries of reality. Imagine waking up in a world truly committed to science on a new and higher level." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Chapter 17: POLITICS OF THEORY
>
> ... The basic idea of Politics of Theory (or “of Narrative”) is to monitor, steer and regulate the fundamental “theory of everything” that people subscribe to; our shared narrative or worldview...
>
> All societies more or less brainwash their citizens into a certain story (or set of competing stories) about reality, society, humanity and life. We are all socialized into a certain identity, ideo­logy and ontology—ideas about our “self” and our place in the un­i­verse, about what’s right and wrong, and about what’s really real in the first place. We imbue the cul­tural code of our society; we are bathed in it, fed with it, marinated in it, drowned in it. Every person who speaks a language and is above a certain cognitive stage of dev­elop­ment will have some kind of answers to the fun­damental quest­ions of life, and most of these originate from their social context. It’s in the air we breathe.
>
> The modern conception of a historical development towards higher le­v­els of individual autonomy in thinking (they used to tell people to believe in Jesus, but now we’re free to believe what we want) is manifestly wrong. Or, at least, it is “true but partial”. As we discussed in chapter 3, the mod­ern project and its reach for freedom is undergirded by a corres­ponding growth of intimate mechanisms of control, mechanisms through which minds, bodies and behaviors are controlled and coordinated to an unpre­cedented degree. The most obvious of these mechanisms is schoo­ling: “Society” takes all kids at age six and indoctrinates them for twelve years. If that isn’t brain­wash­ing of an astronomical magnitude, I don’t know what is: millions of people, shaped, trained, drilled, molded, taught, disci­plined, controlled.
>
> No matter how much we may tell ourselves that our educational system is “liberal” and only brings out “what wants to flourish within each per­son”, it is obvious that such socialization must always be structured some­how, meaning, it must build on certain premises and ideals...
>
> So the question, then, is not “should we have massive and extensive brain­washing of millions?” —we already do, and we probably must: Mo­d­ern soc­iety relies upon an educational system, and all societies rely upon shared narra­tives and intricate coordination of people’s perspectives and streams-of-action.
>
> Rather, the question is, “should this underlying theory of everything be brought under contin­uous, ex­plicit, democratic scrutiny, or should it re­main beyond our reach in terms of democratic governance”?
>
> ... we will make the massive brainwashing of everyone visible rather than invis­ible, explicit rather than implicit, trans­parent rather than opaque, thought-through and well-argued rather than cust­om­ary and habitual, sub­ject to public scrutiny rather than to quiet con­sent, in the hands of the many rather than the few.
>
> ... So, yes, I am saying we should use political means to brainwash the population. And yes, I do recognize this is a dangerous idea. But the point is we’re already doing it. All I am saying is that we should add a demo­cratic discussion about it and call it for what it is. Is that more or less im­prudent than the current system? Is it more or less democratic?...
>
> Should the massive, ongoing brainwashing be brought under demo­cratic control or not? The main difference, the deepest difference, between modern and metamodern society lies in the answer to this question.
>
> Modern society and its project of enlightenment and progress uses sci­ence and economic grow­th to reshape nature in accordance with the inner projections of the human mind—but it does not see its own culture and fundamental world­view as subject to change. It doesn’t recognize that not only does our knowledge of the world evolve, but so does our perspective of our knowledge of the world. Our own thinking and our viewing of the world are believed to simply rest in the background; they are a constant, as “man” pro­gresses thr­ough the universe over the millennia!
>
> The postmodern critique of the modern world revealed that the under­lying patterns of thought and ideas governing the lives of people can be quest­ioned, analyzed, deconstructed, unveiled. It led intellectuals to ques­tion the universality of the modern project in its entirety.
>
> Metamodern society takes that fundamental code, our very own per­spec­tives, into its own hands, and shapes it, just as it shapes nature; metamodernism is the historical point when society becomes conscious of itself.
>
> So if modern “man” boldly rode out to conquer outer space, metamod­ern soc­iety takes into account that the very concept of “man” and its under­lying presupp­ositions will only last for a while and is already being replaced by other ideas of the fundamental protagonist in the universe: self-org­aniz­a­tion and conscious­ness, categories beyond any anthropocen­tric and hum­­anistic bia­ses. And then it—“it” being the metamodern mind as a pattern of hum­an agency—works to reshape not only outer space, but the very per­spective, the very maps from which that reorg­anizing is to occur. It is the conquest, if you will, of inner space.
>
> Just as our maps of the uni­verse, our scientific maps, are always limited in scope, reli­ability and applicability, so are our maps of meaning, our dis­courses, our narratives, our mythologies, our language structures, our “im­aginaries” and “imagined communities”, our cognitive schema—our soc­ial construction of reality. And, given different circumstances, some maps are better than others, and our maps must be reshaped to fit what­ever conditions life throws at us, as (in)dividual persons, as states, as an emerging global civilization.
>
> To the modern mind, nature is the object , the “great it” and culture is the subject , the “great me” who acts upon a silent cosmos. To the meta­modern mind, culture and nature are both part of the object, whereas the subject is the transpersonal developmental process itself. Just as na­ture must be governed, regulated and controlled for mod­ern civiliza­tion to exist, so must culture itself be governed, regul­ated and con­trolled for a metamodern soc­iety to emerge and be sustained.
>
> “Metamodern society” is defined as a society where the modern ail­ments—eco­logical unsustainability, excess inequality and alienation—are extin­gui­sh­ed, for all practical purposes; a relative utopia. If we want to achieve relative utopia, we’re going to have to consciously and deliberately develop culture itself.
>
> ... Simply put: Who gets to brainwash who, and on what grounds?
>
> ... Yes, some worldviews and narratives are likely to be “better” than oth­ers, given certain technological/historical circumstances, and thus it is of ut­most concern that the “best” narratives come to the fore and take hold.
>
> But here’s the para­dox: We can of course only evaluate what might be a “good” narra­tive from inside of the confines of whatever narrative we already subscribe to! In one narrative the greatest good for the greatest number is the goal, in another it is to get people to wake up to the truth of Jesus being our savior and the son of God, literally speaking (lest they go to hell for eternity, which is serious business after all), and so on. Each of them will have us transform nature and culture in different direc­tions, according to diff­erent premises.
>
> ... When our culture begins to create institutions of Politics of Theory, it takes a view of itself that is necessarily culturally and historically situated ; culture considers how to develop itself . Culture becomes both object and subject, both the change-maker and the clay in the potter’s hands. A potter made of clay (as the first man by God in the biblical Genesis), who in turn makes another potter of clay. A fractal of infinite depth. And when we begin to recreate life itself by means of bio-engineering, this takes on a whole new dimension: cul­ture recreat­ing nature, recreating conscious­ness, recreating culture, recre­ating nat­ure, and so on… We are diss­olving the boundary bet­ween nature and culture and diving into the depths of development.
>
> ... If Politics of Theory entails taking the development of our culture and shared narratives into our own hands, it makes a whole lot of difference how the dog chases its own tail. Is it stumbling about cluelessly or is it an elegant, self-conscious and playful swirl of a dance? We should create institutions that improve the possibilities of dif­ferent world­views to meet and argue about the proper balance between them.
>
> Under the best possible settings and circumstances there is an increa­sed likelihood that the more complex, universal, nuanced and (in a deep sense of the word) secularized worldviews and value-systems eventually will win out. The “more advanced” worldviews are likely to win because they tend to beat the simpler ones on their own terms. But again—that is only true over a large number of repeated itera­tions, under the proper circumstances of free and fair exchanges, mini­mally distorted by power games, rhetoric, social domin­an­ce hierarchies and so forth.
>
> Under the current historical conditions, we have democratic instituti­ons; rights and liberties that enshrine a somewhat free and fair “market of ideas”, even if distortions and manipulations necessarily occur. What we don’t have is a proper set of institutions with the explicit goal of monito­ring and steering the worldviews of the population. Politics of Theory would offer just that: an institutional framework for our stories about the world to come together, and for the best narrative—or meta-narrative with a set of sub-narratives—to be explored, developed and spread.
>
> ... The brain­washing should be demo­crat­ically up for grabs by all contenders, and all political actors will need to specify which worldview they would like to spread and why—which means all worldviews become subject to greater self-scrut­iny.
>
> What you get then is not that one monolithic idea someone read in this or that book gets shoved down everyone’s throat, but a richer “diffract­ion” of many different perspectives. You know, diffra­ction is when sound­waves cross one another and create new patterns. We should get the best possible cultural pattern-of-patterns, and make cer­tain it is spread in a fair and transparent manner. That’s what Politics of Theory is about; it wants your brain.
>
> ... So let’s say there is a Ministry of Theory . An important function of this institu­tion would be to gather rich and complex data about what peo­ple really believe about the world, trying to understand the internal struct­ures of these world­views, and to present these data on a regular basis—for public discussion. More on the methods for doing so below. This institu­tion would build up a large number of small agencies thro­ugh­out society, particularly within all layers of educa­tion, and these would convey and explain certain key ideas and basic suppo­sitions that have been demo­cratically agreed upon. In the end it will always be up to each person what they believe or agree with, but society certainly does set up a norm-system which promotes and rewards certain beliefs and not others. This should be a transparent process.
>
> Questions might be: Should society support democratic and tolerant val­ues; how intolerant should it be to intolerance? Should there be a mul­ti­cultural back­drop or a trans-cult­ural one? Should natural science be coupled with an appre­ciation for the humanities and for spiritual con­cerns? Should we have a materialistic-red­uct­ionistic or holistic-emergent­ist “default onto­logy” (the first is today’s mainstream)? How anthropo­cen­tric should our worldview be? (current discourse: very!) What general timeframes should we identify with: here and now, or ten years, or a century, or even longer? Each of these questions can be answer­ed at mul­ti­ple levels; what ranges of answers should be taught and discussed, and to what extent?
>
> These underlying suppositions—including and especially the metaphy­sical ones—will affect news reporting, the arts, our pastime inter­ests, our basic frameworks for political thinking, which questions that can be asked and seriously discussed in respectable settings, and so forth. Remember the norm-system we discussed earlier? Well from now on it won’t be up to power struggles in the shadows to decide upon their evolu­tion. It will have become a conscious process.
>
> ... Bluntly put, today’s society brainwashes people to accept symbol­-stage E Modern and, at some university campuses, F Postmodern, whereas fut­ure society should brainwash us with some symbol-stage G Metamodern stuff to go with that. In practice, of course, people will disagree vehemently about how to rank different worldviews in a developmental sequence, or whether or not such ranking is possible in the first place, or what it means for a certain world­view to be developed. And that’s alright. The point isn’t that there should be an elite of meta­mod­ernists who read a few Hanzi books and then brainwash everybody else; the point is that this process of deliberate discussion of our worldviews gets to materi­alize in the first place. From there on, it’s up to all storytellers of society to try their best to make their story about reality the one supported by the public and its instit­utions. Today we cer­tainly have stories that are sup­por­ted by society’s institut­ions, but we don not have organs to deal with such deep and funda­mental issues in an open and transparent manner. We lack a Politics of Theory. If such a process were to exist, this would dramatically increase our col­l­ective capacity to critic­ally reflect upon our own worldviews, upon those of one another, and upon finding ways to co-exist and ideally devel­op toge­ther. All political parties would need to specify which worldview they subs­cribe to, and this would spur a much greater philosophical depth through­out the political discourse. Politics gets married to philosophy. In a very non-linear way, we will have vindicated Plato’s old adage “until philosoph­ers become kings”:
>
> “There will be no end to the troubles of states, or of humanity itself, till phil­osophers become kings in this world, or till those we now call kings and rulers really and truly become philosophers, and political power and philo­sophy thus come into the same hands”.
>
> Or rather, through the process of self-organization and deeper govern­ance “the people” become philosophers, and in that instance, we also be­come kings. We begin to deliberate at a new level; we open the doors of collective perception, and we become masters of our own culture, and the fractal of mind-and-self-and-society cracks open to us as a co-created pro­cess of conscious evolution... If we don’t find ways of becoming nimble self-trans­formers at a deep, collec­tive level, we are bound to be stuck in the stories of yesteryear and get hit by an end­less cascade of catastrophes as we are always one step behind the society we ourselves have created. If we recreate our environ­ment, we must also recreate our culture and ourselves. Seriously—we need to have institutions that make culture itself tran­s­form­able because our life conditions will change again and again. So it’s not about finding “the right answers” about life, the universe and eve­ry­thing (let’s say we come up with the answer “42”) and teach it to every­one. It’s about finding ways of tearing down culture again and again, to always see what lies underneath and beyond. It’s about making our shared narratives more adaptable and more flexible to changing life con­ditions.
>
> Example: Big History in Schools
>
> So, what would be a good place to start if we were to develop our shared narra­tives about the world? How about the way history is taught in our educational system? After all, our understanding of the past determines how we make sense of the present, and how we intend on shaping the fu­ture; our sense of what kind of society we live in, and where it ought to go.
>
> It is therefore no coincidence that historiography remains one of the most hotly contested fields of all the sciences and frequently has become subject to political interference. In the past, history curriculums were larg­ely concerned with Biblical accounts and the good deeds and glorious vic­tories of kings and nobles so as to ensure people became good Christ­ians and loyal subjects of the monarch. Later, as part of the nation-buil­ding effort, school curriculums came to focus more on the histories of the nati­on and the state. And as societies democratized, past struggles for political eman­cipation and victories over authoritarian dictatorships were high­lighted in these national narratives so that pupils would become good, demo­cratic citizens. Such nation-state centered narratives still re­main do­min­ant in most schools today.
>
> But despite its many merits, this kind of history teaching has increasin­gly begun to be at odds with the inter­ests of our emerging global civiliza­tion. It teaches us to think too much in accordance with linear and perio­dical history; it fails to em­phasize the truly global aspects of societal and technological dev­elopment; it overemphasizes the con­struction of natio­nal identities and mythologies; it overemphasizes the role of states and ethn­icities in our present era; and it provides too limited understandings of the inter­actions between humans and the rest of the bio­sphere.
>
> In recent years, postmodernism, mostly in universities, has chal­lenged the national approach to history by focusing on topics such as the lives and histories of those who have been largely ignored or been subject to the biased perspectives of the powerful: ethnic and religious minorities, indigenous populations, women and sexual minorities, the colonized, the enslaved, the vanquished souls who never got a chance to write their per­spectives into our history books.
>
> This is arguably more in tune with the multi­cultural societies of today’s post-colonial, global world, but it still suffers from a number of inadequa­cies: it’s overly preoccupied with details and smaller histories, more con­cerned with picking apart established conce­ptions than creating new ones, and it offers little help to navigate a hyper­complex, ever more technolo­gical advanced and increasingly interconnec­ted global civilization on the brink of ecological collapse.
>
> Although postmodern historiography is better than the conventional, nation-centered one, as it does acknowledge different histories and per­spec­tives, it has no principle by which it can coordinate and compare this multi­tude of histories. It simply “smashes” them together. This is obvio­usly more inclusive than just favoring one history or one perspective, but the post­modern “smash approach” leaves us with a “history in pieces”. It urgently lacks meta-narratives to link the many pieces together.
>
> ... But without any meta-narratives, we are left with is a fragmented and parochial view of history, too absorbed in details and devoid of any attem­pts at fitting them together into a greater, coherent worldview; in effect ren­dering history lessons into a random presentation of ODTAA, “one-damned-thing-after-another”, to quote the historian Arnold Toynbee—which makes it difficult to explain why anyone should bother studying history at all. How is all of this connected to my life? one may ask. One learns his­tory, but does not develop one’s relationship to history as a whole.
>
> This can be harmful since it creates a fragmented and estranged view of ones place in the world that may contribute to a subtle but pervasive feel­ing of disorientation and not “fitting in”, what Émile Durkheim refer­s to as “anomie” (the breakdown of social bonds between the individual and her community).
>
> ... Big History is an emerging historiographical discipline that spans the entire history of the universe: from the big bang, to the creation of stars and planets, to the origins of life and on to humankind and the present. And as such, it is a multidisciplinary approach that seeks to present a more universal and seamless narrative that bridges traditional world his­tory with both archaeology and anthropology, as well as natural sciences like physics, cosmology, evolutionary biology, climatology and environ­mental studies, all viewed as historical sciences.
>
> Big History is thus an attempt to overcome the perceived division between humans and the natural world prevailing in both modern and postmodern thinking. Whereas postmodernism does avoid the nation-centrism of conventional historiography, it is still, for the most part, large­ly anthropocentric. Big History, however, sees human culture as part of nat­ure, not separated from it. It strives for a world-centric perspective that emphasizes universal themes and patterns without a sharp distinction bet­ween the human ex­per­ience and the earlier and ongoing evolution of the physical and biological world.
>
> In Big History, humans do not take the center stage. The central agents are the patterns of self-organization that occur both in nature and culture. Hence, it is not we who are to be seen as the driving force behind change, but rather the patterns of change per se which simply manifest them­selves through human beings and their culture. Big History thus expands the reach of historiography: It sees nature in history and it treats the natural world as a historical development.
>
> This cosmological approach to history is capable of giving students a more secular, scientific and above all a more comprehensive and inter­connected view of life and society than most history courses can offer; and it per­mits asking the very large questions and encourages searching for greater meaning in the past.
>
> According to David Christian, the ambition of Big History is to assem­ble all the disconnected fragments of science into a coherent and accessi­ble account of origins, “a modern creation myth” in his words. Both science and myth. I take it the good professor is being ironic and sincere at the same time. How very metamodern of him. Yet, is there any better way to provide us with an overarching narrative of creation itself?
>
> Postmodernism has taken us to the end of the road in terms of diffe­rentiation and reductionism. Modern science became such a powerful tool of explanation by reducing the objective world to its smallest and most easily comprehensible parts. This development of increasing analytic dif­fe­rentiation continued with postmodernism by chopping reality down to even smaller pieces by ripping the formerly coherent neutral observer apart. What we ended up with was an extraordinary understanding of the pieces themselves, and a critical stance towards the subjective observer, but at the expense of grasping the whole. We have successfully decon­structed the world like a kid taking apart a tape recorder in order to understand how it works, but we are yet to engage with the task of putting it together again so as to hear the enchanted tones it once used to play...
>
> ... The endeavor to con­struct a new meta-narrative, stated in mythic form, is as idealistic as it is pragmatic. After all, despite all our modern knowledge and reasoning, we still seem utterly incapable of eradicating the poorly composed myths that each of us spontaneously constructs nevertheless. So why not deliberately create a better myth and have it out in the open so that we can criticize it and improve upon it?
>
> It is a relevant question to ask if this kind of historical understanding should replace the prominent position of national histories. Would that affect political opin­ion and the deep frameworks of understanding shared by generations? Yes, certainly. Is it a good idea? Probably, but there is much that needs to be tried and discussed. It is no mere question of edu­cational politics, it is more than that: it is Politics of Theory.
>
> You can go on with similar questions: What about environmental aw­are­ness and systems’ views of life? Should panpsychism (the idea that com­petes with materialism, arguing that consciousness is ubiquitous in the uni­verse) be discussed in school? Or how about animal rights? We can set the stage for how people will create their world­views. Let’s make sure we do this well, and that we arrive at the “best” (or least bad) solution through the best possible communicative processes.
>
> Of course, some people are going to think we should eliminate all trad­itional religion and superstition. Some are going to think that we should make everyone believe in Jesus as our savior. Some will think that every­body should be supported in critical thinking and resistance against capi­talist power struct­ures. And that’s fair enough; there will remain any number of worldviews side by side in society, and people will cling to these narra­tives. In a demo­cratic, free and fair process of Politics of Theory, these factions will need to fight it out in a civilized manner and affect the overall sanctioned narrative.
>
> Those who disagree with the prevailing narrative and its balance bet­ween different worldviews will at least get to relate to an open, transparent structure, and they will be offered democratic means to state their case and to change it.
>
> ...
>
> There are already lots of useful meth­ods for studying the “theories of reality” prevalent in society; we just need to start doing it at scale, in a more coordinated fashion and link it to the world of politics and democratic governance... We will move from simply being ruled by culture, to both governing culture and being governed by it —there­by reshaping the direction of the evol­u­tion of all life on our planet." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

this whole big history quote should go in the book where big history is mentioned as what should be learned - I already thought that way! I stopped copying text - just refer to the book and the whole shebang about big history

chapter 17 is perhaps the best one in the book (haven't read the last few chapters yet) and most of it ended up in here

> "... society and our perspectives of it, in large part, are one and the same thing. It is only by developing our perspective of society that we can change it, and it is only by changing society we can change ourselves in lasting and meaningful manners as society sets the limits of our pers­pecti­ves. And that’s what political metamodernism does; it develops our shar­ed capacity to hold, coordinate and use perspectives.
>
> ... This process sets in motion the generation of a self-aware and self-organ­izationing political culture, the hallmarks of metamodern soc­iety; a society that gazes deeper into its own structures, its own becoming, its own citi­zens, its own future and place in the universe. And this master pattern is self-reinforcing; it is already an attractor on the maps of history. Not be­cause I said so, but be­cause it makes sense.
>
> ... politi­cal metamodernism has the shortest average distance to all other posi­ti­ons . It is closer to socialism than the conservatives, closer to conser­va­tism than the ecologists, closer to ecologism than the libertarians, closer to liberalism than the social democrats, and even closer to the political frin­ges than the center and vice versa. It is not the most popular of posi­tions, but it is the least hated. It is thus, in a sense, the opposite of cheap-scoring populism—and yet it can approach and deal with popu­lism more easily than does con­ventional centrism and liberalism. Populism sounds exciting but is boring in terms of its potentials. Co-developmental politics sounds boring, even goes out of its way to look harmless, but it is truly radi­cal and trans­formative. So the question is not to have one strong relation or alliance. It is to have many weak ties , and to compete by having the most such weak ties. In network terms, you thereby reach the highest centrality ; you are more conn­ected than all the other positions. And as you have co-developmen­tal ties and processes with all other positions, you also gain higher “gravity”, i.e. you pull them a little more than they pull you, not least because you always have more contacts to draw upon. The centrality and gravity of power is most concentrated to “bridges” in the network. And as metamodernism is itself often an expression of reinte­gra­tions of the three spheres of life that modernity differentiated—the pro­fessional, the poli­tical and the personal—this also means that the people it attracts are more likely to have contacts across various econo­mic, politi­cal and cult­ural spheres of life. This also facilitates the concen­tration of power into the hands of political metamodernism.
>
> ... To make metamodern politics happen, you don’t have to ask nicely. You just have to outcompete the crude politics of modern society, on its own terms. Hence, other regions of the world will need to compete by trying to copy some of the processes—and this em­bodied know-how of metamodern society will in itself become an impor­tant ex­port.
>
> ... The good news is it doesn’t even require you to do anything evil. All you do is act very politely and be super-nice to your political “opponents” and co-develop the political realm. Learn from them, listen, really try their arguments out and work on getting a more solid grounding for your own. If you fail to act transpartially and co-developmentally, you wreck the plan. You can even be entirely transparent about the whole “hostile take-over” plan! In some ways all of this is more than a little byzantine and Leninist: the elaborate plot of a small vanguard, and so on. But on the other hand it is entirely non-violent, requires no coups, no lies, no deceptions, no hypo­crisy, no mani­pulation, no low blows in debates. It requires highly ethical and impeccable behavior, and honesty about one’s own will to (trans­personal) power. That’s all.
>
> ... do you really think you will get even the resemblance of good environmental politics without Empirical Politics? Think again. Do you think you will get biospheric and deep-ecological consciousness in the gen­eral population without Existential Poli­tics and Politics of Theory? That, my friend, is un informed naivety.
>
> ... And then we conspire (the literal meaning of which is: breathing together) openly and trans­parently to change the world with transnational, transpartisan, non-linear, co-devel­op­mental politics with a view from com­plexity. We im­prove upon the code, strengthen the network, gather key competences as we sensitively try to under­stand the twists and turns of the world-system. We look for places of opportunity, globally. We look to places to act, for ways to engage—for “pressure points” we can work on; for the right mo­ments. We work on our relationships to each other and we help one ano­ther out." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "People stuck in the modern ideologies all resist the Nordic ideology : people with conservative minds think it’s almost identical to socialism (it’s not), leftists consider it a cheap sellout and a betrayal—a kind of neo­liber­alism—libertarians find it overbearing with state control and downright totalitarian, anar­ch­ists think it’s mainstream centrist liberalism, centrists that it is dan­gerous fringe extremism, and nationalists see it as an radical form of dehumanizing globalism. Ecologists come a little closer; some of them can see what it’s really about, but most of them just think it’s weird and that it focuses suspiciously much on human happiness and too little on pois­oned creeks and acid rain... Political metamodernism touches upon and comes strangely close to all of the abovementioned positions. But since it is not entirely identi­cal to any of these, it does provoke allergies in all of them. Yet, metamodernism provokes somewhat less resistance than each of these do to each other. The winning point is, as we have seen, that political metamodernism is closer to all the other positions than they are to each other... The result, then, is that metamodernism has by far the shortest average distance to all other points in the modern ideological space. In the “concep­tual space” of mo­dern ideology, political metamodernism has the highest centrality. And that’s where the power is. So even if the Nordic ideology has few explicit followers, it is still, on aver­age, the least despised, and thereby capable of gaining the great­est centrality and gravity within all power networks: politi­cal, eco­n­omic and cultural. The emerging Nordic ideo­logy has as its ulti­mate adversary not any specific modern ideology; they are only stepping stones to get to the real enemy: modern society itself... Yet, the task is, as we have seen, to beat all of these ideologies at their own game, to infect them with bits and pieces of political metamodernism so that metamodern soc­iety emerges through the interactions of all the different modern (and post­modern) forces. Our sinister plot is, as shown earlier, to sneak up on all of them and “remote control” them in a decen­tralized, co-created and dialectical fashion until they’re all caught in the metamodern master pattern and thus begin to work towards the attractor points of deeper equality and higher freedom that come from a listening society through the tragic dance between dividuation and integration. And because we, the metamodernists, have the arguments and ethics on our side and the historical attractors are working in our direction, we don’t need to be secretive about anything. We just need to communicate sensi­tively and effectively.
>
> ... The only way to stop people from voluntarily choosing the meta­modern solutions would be to stop free competition by some kind of threat of viol­ence or monopoly. The only thing that can stop liberalism from being eaten alive by metamodernism is authoritarianism.
>
> ... You need to get people to a point in their lives where they genuinely understand and care about issues larger than themselves. That’s Existen­tial Politics. You need to make sure people have good enough social rela­tions to not get stuck in prisoners’ dilemmas that hold back our devel­op­ment and potential to care and not get stuck in materialistic status gam­es. That’s Gemeinschaft Politics. You need to see to it that the systems of governance can nimbly and effectively redesign themselves so as to deal with new environmental challenges when they become known, in a way that gains support and legitimacy. That’s Democrati­zation Politics. You need to make certain that all of society is aligned with what is empirically shown to create circular economies and cradle-to-cradle processes, and you need to make sure that you spot and correctly understand environ­mental threats such as climate change and that the public is well informed and has the ability to respond reasonably. That’s Empirical Politics. And you need to make certain that ideas about ecology, sustainability and hu­manity’s place in a larger context of nature per­meate people’s conscious­ness and all of our ideas about life. That’s Politics of Theory. And un­less you’re an eco­fascist and just don’t care about the freedom of people, you need to make sure that all of these processes can play out without oppress­ing people, and that’s Emancipation Politics. So tell me again how you were going to create a sustainable society with­out political metamodernism. Can you see how unrealistic any eco­logist ideology would be without these processes?
>
> ... So, as I mentioned earlier, you don’t have to be the most liked alterna­tive—that’s the populist position. You just have to be the least hated one. The socialists will think you’re a cheap fake, sure, but they will hate you a little less than they hate people who sing the advent of global neoliberal­ism. Liber­tarians will think you’re a dangerous control-freak, but they will hate you a little less than people who explicitly want to tear down the free mar­ket. Con­servatives will be disgusted with your idealism, but a little less so than with actual anarchists. Greens will think you postpone the necess­ary transition to a sustainable society, but will certainly think better of you than all those groups that uncritically embrace economic growth and couldn’t give a damn about the collapsing environment. Even anarchists will hate you a little less—if for no other reason because they really hate everybody else. Political metamodernism is at the center, not of the left-right political spectrum, but of the network—suspended clear in the sky.
>
> As we have seen, you can only beat each of the modern ideologies on its own terms: They simply won’t accept other terms than their own. The holders of these pers­pectives arrived at them by maximizing certain values deter­mined a priori , so if you try to propose other values, they won’t go along. That’s a large part of the reason why the modern ideolo­gies are per­petually stuck in a trench war in regards to each other." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "The difference between holism and totalitarianism is, fundamen­tally, that holism relates to and coordinates the pieces of the whole, whereas totalitarianism takes on the impossible and destructive task of controll­ing the whole. Totalitarianism fails because it subjects all pieces to the logic of one piece. Totalitarianism is holism without a correspon­ding ca­pacity for perspective taking; coordination without solidari­ty with oth­ers’ pers­pectives. The necessary power balance is curt­ail­ed.
>
> And how do you stop any one part from controlling all the others? You make sure as many perspectives as possible are empowered in an open-ended process. You make sure there are information flows to tear down any one governing logic that would assert itself. And you make sure the best poss­ible processes are cultivated for such resistance to take place. Mobility, flow, multiplicity, sometimes gory dispute—these are the pillars of truth. Totalitarianism is failed holism, and we need successful holism.
>
> ... Most importantly, we make an effort to see that the ghost of totalitari­anism’s past is not “in someone else”; it is a transpersonal affair, inhe­rent to each of us and to the configurations of our relations. The better we see and acknow­ledge our own flirtations with totality, with our longing for power and our greedy claims for possessing the truth—the better our chan­ces of prod­uctively balancing holism and freedom.
>
> It’s a slack line to walk, admittedly, two gaping hells below us: frag­men­tation and decay on one side, totalitarian oppression on the other—both of truly unprecedented magni­tudes. If we crash global civilization and its surr­ounding ecosystems, it will likely be a calamity greater than the black plague or the wars of Genghis Khan. And if global totalitarianism takes root in a time of unlimited sur­veillance, genetic manipulation, and advan­ced forms of brainwashing—the sheer terr­or of that oppression can and will be worse than nazism...
>
> That’s the dangerous dream of communism. It has little to do with drab concrete housing blocks, or polluting Trabant cars, or secret KGB agents, or nuclear warheads, or military marches, or mad dictators, or any of the things we usually associate with communism. We can even detach it from any specific vision about who owns the factories or how the eco­nomy is governed.
>
> Real communism, then, in this deeper sense, simply connects to the det­er­mination to do what it takes to bring about a post-capitalist society. By definition, a communist society is that which dialectically flows from, and transcends, capitalist society and in which everyday life is governed and coordinated by another logic than economic capital. This logic must be less cruel and more rational, more in line with human needs and higher stages of inner development. It is a holistic, human­ized version of mod­ernity. Communism, in this deeper and generalized sense, is holis­tic post-­capi­tal­ism—plus the mor­ally driven determ­ination to achi­eve it.
>
> The communists of the 19th and 20th centuries were wrong about a num­ber of issues concerning the dynamics and attractors of modern so­cieties and their economies. And this led to some terrible mis­takes, the worst of which was trying to force institutions into being with­out corr­es­­ponding develop­ments of psy­chology, behavior and culture (see App­en­dix A and B); leading to jamm­ed information feedback processes, which in turn led to a fail­ing society, and ultimately to Gulag, surveill­ance, terror and coll­apse.
>
> But some core aspects of communism were not in themselves false, only premature and out-of-context. Thereby I am not saying that bad con­sequen­c­es should be excused on account of good intentions. I am saying that par­tial truths should not be discarded on account of guilt-by-association.
>
> What, then, are the communist truths shared by political metamod­ern­ism? One such aspect is the uncompromising moral determination to change the nat­ure of everyday life. Another is that there is in­deed some­thing that comes after capitalist relations, and that one can align one­self with such an emergence because it rhymes with discernable stages of techno­logical and societal development. A third aspect is that there should be a collect­ively intelligent form of governance based upon a more radical and deeper form of demo­cracy than representative party politics. A fourth one is that there should be a world-centric party (or meta-party) that takes on a transnation­al and even tran­scendental role of trans­forming soc­iety from a global perspec­tive, and that there should be some kind of van­guard who develops and spreads a shared theo­retical and organizational basis for such work. And a fifth, and last one, is that such a process-oriented party should rely upon the dialectics inhe­rent to society in order to guide its development and to gain power.
>
> ... Mod­ern political thinkers will tend to emphasize the aspects that others share with fascism while denying their own connections, so as to prove one’s moral high ground, being “the farthest from fascism”, its very opposite. But it makes more sense to acknowledge that fascism has certain partial truths that are being denied and disowned, and then to productively own up to these and to include them in one’s own per­spective.
>
> It should be apparent, then, that fascism cannot simply be discarded and never related to again. You can say that fascism is the cata­combs of the modern ideo­logical metropolis: It constitutes a vast network of secret and forgotten under­ground tunn­els connecting all of the poli­tical ideolog­ies. I guess you can say the same about all the ideologies to some extent—they all inter­connect—but fascism remains the most denied and least under­stood.
>
> ... political metamodernism is both the ideology that is the closest to fascism and the one most in opposition to it...
>
> ... That’s the essential truth; fascism is so profoundly evil because it is dem­onic in this primary archetypal sense. A demon is a fallen angel, some­thing profound and beautiful in the service of something base and shallow. Developmental imbalance...
>
> ... The word “fascism” stems from Italian fascio meaning a bundle of rods, ultimately from the Latin word fasces ; it means to unite into a whole. Not all of us want heroism all the time and in every situation, but all of us do have this inner longing for greatness, for something far beyond ourselves. We like glory. A part of us secretly resents having given up any chance for rising higher—and that same part resents glimmers of the Übermensch in our fell­ow human beings.
>
> For all its wackiness and evil, for all its developmental imbalances and inherent pathology, fasc­ism is the ideology that most effectively honors this basic existential truth: the longing for heroism, power and trans­cen­dence through our deeds.
>
> ... Fasc­ism is the opposite of refi­ned demo­cracy: it is pure dom­inan­ce and sub­mission. It is speed, excite­ment, violence, blood, iron, autonomy, force, will, power. It is untamed—erotic in the deepest sense of the word.
>
> ... Fascism was and remains a feverish boy room fantasy. But psycholog­ically, for all its immature lies and manipulations, it honored the fact that a part of us is always susceptible to such a dreamy will for greatness. We can­not truly “grow out of it”; only deny it. The world is not enough. As lack of meaning and lacking sense of strength and vitality take hold in many young men, and some women, in our days, they turn again to these themes. From their imprisoned anguish grows new streams of fasc­ism. Some few join overtly fascist movements, others nationalist and radi­cal-conservative ones and “Indo-European identitarianism”, and yet oth­ers find more innocent ways of reenact­ing aspects of these: pick-up artist “gaming” (social power games to get women), BDSM tantra work­shops, violent porn, some of the authoritarian undercurrents of the men’s move­ment, anti-feminism, anti-modern anti-“decadent” art sen­ti­ments, varia­tions of theories about “the fall of the West” and other ideas about cyclical civilizational patterns where you need to rescue “civili­zation” by becom­ing more manly... Not all of these things are all bad or all fascist. The men’s movement and learning good dating skills particularly have potentials for creating prod­uctive results, and some aspects of these blend into political meta­modern­ism. Viewed as a whole, these partly interrelated phenomena do however reflect the staying power of fascism and the masculine and boy­ish qualities it embod­ies. Most of it is relatively subtle and hidden from public view, but the psycho­logical forces brewing are strong.
>
> ... What, then, does any of this have to do with political metamodernism? Here it is: Political metamodernism shares a part of that same demonic quality, which comes from owning the unapologetic striving to take the hero’s journey.
>
> ... The dark ominous feeling you get when you see me prancing around is not a reflection of your kind, critical mind resisting the sell-out to power that I represent. It is a reflection of your own disowned green little devil, of your disowned will to power, and the resentment you feel when some­one else expresses so clearly and straightforwardly what you have hidden away from view. You’re the sell-out, not me. How do I know that? I know it simply because I understand that power and freedom are sisters; creation is power. So any time you want to chan­ge or create anything, you must have a will to power, and any time you make a power claim, there will be adversaries who have different ideas, ideals and interests, and thus you have to own up to that adversity and you have to try to win. And without a wish to change or create anything, you can have no morality; no wish to strive for the good. Hence: pure morality requires a pure will to power . Your denied will to power is im­moral, and that’s what you feel reflected in yourself when you watch me unfold without apology... Moral purity, calm wisdom, humility—that’s the lie, that’s “the liberal inno­cent”... We are all nodes in the great web of life; and life pulsates with the will to power. All life literally eats its way through other flows of matter and energy. All events feed on entropy; on decay. A human body consists of organic matter under viol­ent control: killed, chewed, swallowed, digested, broken down and reorga­nized. This is an indispu­table phy­si­cal fact. Power is transpersonal becau­se all creation is co-creation , and all emer­gence is relational—and power, ultimately, is the will and capacity to free­ly create; it is the will of poten­tials to emerge as actualities... Nice Guy. Stop being a hypocritical inquisitor or witch-hunter and admit that you want shitloads of delicious power—and then be kind to people. We should all try our best to be kindhearted. But there is also Sklaven­moral disguised as niceness, and that’s a problem. Unapologetically in love with power—and uncompromisingly idealist­ic. Both and. Right there is an equ­il­ibrium from which we can build a very pro­found sense of inter­pers­onal, or trans­personal, trust. And that’s the space from which meta­modern pol­itics can emerge—from the trust that you will use your power kindly and I will use mine kindly, for mutual ben­efit and mutual goals; in a network of shared will to transpersonal power.
>
> ... This is where fascism informs political metamodernism; this is the glo­ry of fascism—it honors the will to power, to superiority, to what Socrates called megalothymia . It’s that principle within us that wants more, to be viewed and recognized not only as an equal member of society, but as a majestic and awe-inspiring being. That’s the truth even about Dalai Lama, Eckhart Tolle and Yoda. And centuries of denial and meditation will never efface it: to want anything, is to want power." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

> "Our best defense against new totalitarianisms is to find ways of looking inwards to engage with our necessary but dangerous dreams in transpa­rent and demo­cratic ways where a multiplicity of perspectives (and pers­pectives of perspectives) balance out and dissipate their ex­plosive concen­trations of power.

The following is from appendix A where political metamodernism is compared with communism and why communism failed

actually no, no more quotes - just read it again if necessary

> "The failure of communism is also a fruitful place to initiate a deeper discussion about political metamodern­ism. Although it is not a comparison I am entirely comfortable with, it is not irrele­vant. There is a kind of post-Marxist undercurrent in much of metamodern think­ing: to see society as evolving through discern­able sta­ges, and the curr­ent capitalist global society as one such stage, to relate to the totality of human experience and try to generate a more ratio­nal and existentially sound foundation for it, to want to develop not only society but also our inner lives and emotions, to strive for higher forms of free­dom, fairness and solidarity. Hey, I even named this book Nordic Ide­ology with an ironic wink at Marx and Engels’ The German Ideology. But if there is a vague spiritual lineage connecting political metamoder­nism to communism, it is only just that: a vague, spiritual link on a gene­ral and abstract level. So let me highlight some key differences be­tween my thinking and the many strands of Marxism. Let us begin by asking why communism failed, and what perspectives might be needed in its place.
>
> ... such an appeal to “human nature” and her inn­ate individuality is of course a rom­antic reciting of beliefs rather than a behavioral-scientific explanation. They just make vague assum­p­tions about “human nature” and engineer morally weighted conclusions from there. This mainstream account of why communism failed has pretty weak explanatory power.
>
> ... Good societies are crea­ted by A) corr­ect analysis, B) smooth inform­ation pro­cessing for the coordina­tion of human agency, C) the dynamic bal­an­­cing of differ­ent powers—and D) the dialectical conflict and mutual interdepen­dence bet­ween diff­erent political interests and ideas. These features of a good society can be brought about more or less deli­berately; they emer­­­ge either as the result of planned act­ions, or throu­gh blind processes that occur beyond our understandings (but for which we often like to snatch the credit)—and most often as a strange dance be­tween these two: the deliberate and the stumbled-upon.
>
> ... The conclusion, then, is not to avoid all holistic visions of society, to avoid all meta-ideologies, but to make damn certain you get them right from the beginning. Again, so if Marx ended up non-linearly killing a hundred million—how many did Mont­es­quieu save? How many instances of torture has he pre­vented? It’s a fair question.
>
> ... the failure of communism serves to underscore that you must make correct assessments of people’s behaviors—in these particu­lar times and places in history—in order to create a sustainable social order. If you make un­realistic assessments regarding how people func­tion, you set in mo­tion vicious cycles that lead to truly terrible results. But on the other hand, if you fail to understand what attractors lie ahead, you stall hist­orical progress, taking the losing side in history, which in the long run causes even more abrupt chan­ges and catastrophic outcomes—for in­st­ance, that we might have global ecological catastrophes. The second conclusion is that “game change” already has occurred throughout history, and that it is a measure of society’s progress: If, and only if, the games of everyday life become fairer and more forgiving, can “progress” be said to have materialized. So this leaves us with the under­standing that the rules of the game—in markets, in work life, in governance, in family life, in love and sex and friendship—can and will change and develop. The question is only how , when, and under the auspices of which meta-ideol­ogy... But to be very clear: the Nordic ideology and its metamodern politics is not communism. It’s much smarter than that." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

The following is from appendix B which further discusses the failure of Marxism

> "Of all the ideas presented in Book One, this is the most important one: The average effective value meme of a population is the single most important factor determining whether it is possible for a society to progress to a new stage of development or not... It is hard to overstate how crucial it is to raise the average effective value meme. The most brilliantly designed constitution and all the best democratic institutions in the world are null and void if the majority of the population subscribe to a Viking warrior ethos; e.g. gravitating tow­ards the Faustian value meme. Likewise a listening society cannot fully materialize as long as the vast majority remains firmly imbedded within a modern, rationalistic worldview. Your effective value meme affects whether you, for instance, consider the environmental degradation of the planet a primary concern, or believe foreign religions are the greatest threat to your existence. It affects whe­ther you believe transnational solutions should be imple­mented to add­ress the dire issues of our time, such as migration, global poverty, and finance, or consider increasing the military bu­dgets of your own nation the best way to manage international relations. It affects the extent of your care and consideration towards others; the number of people and other sentient beings you include in your circle of solidarity. While people sub­scribing to higher value memes tend to be more concerned with the well-being of all humans, in all countries, no matter their back­ground, people at lower value memes tend to have a much smaller circle of solidarity, usually those within their own country, often only of a certain kind, and rarely non-human animals unless they’re considered pets. And learning from the communist experiment, solidarity cannot be enforced from the top; it cannot be taught, and you certainly cannot force anyone to be solidary. True solidarity can only emerge spon­taneously and voluntarily from people’s hearts and minds. Our values are derived from our level of psychological development and play a critical role in the way societies evolve. It sets the limits for how far society can progress, and it determines how well our societies function at the current technological level. Please note, however, that the effective value meme is not considered an overall stage of cognition that people are functioning in accordance with. With effective value meme I simply mean the values of a particular stage of societal development, such as modern or postmodern, towards which a per­son tends to gravitate the strongest. This is not estimated by the com­plexity or depth of a person’s thought, but by the values they ex­press sincere devotion towards... Every society has a kind of demo­graphic where diff­erent percentages of the population can be said to man­ifest and em­body different “value memes”, each being more or less pro­gressive—each corres­ponding to different economic and societal environments. This changes over time, usually moving towards higher value memes as society gets more com­plex. The different value memes can be seen as kinds of political-psych­o­log­ical sta­ges of development. Larger and more complex societies require high­er value memes in the population in order to function and be sust­ain­able. The value memes aren’t really an exact measure of how a person is and how she thinks, but there are certainly clear differences between people of different value memes.
>
> ... But let’s not talk more about theory in general; let’s get on with the point: These four fields of development—psychological, behavioral, sys­t­emic and cultural—interact. Indeed, they define each other—they make each other possible, they set mutual limits, they cause hard crashes and burns in one another. They emerge together: psych­­o­logy, be­hav­ior, culture and system. They are in a perpetual devel­op­men­tal dance. They co-emerge . That’s the point. By the way, by far the majority of professors in sociology, history, psy­cho­logy, economics, cognitive science, philosophy and the natural scien­ces still do not understand this model . And hence they spend meaningless life­times of work trying to resolve questions that have already been resol­ved. With mechanical, relentless tenacity they systematically keep igno­ring one or more of the four fields of development. They discuss, as if there was some great mystery here. They go on, and on, with long and purportedly intell­ectual discu­ssions. “What could it be? Does culture drive the econ­omy or the other way around?” And so forth. And so on.
>
> ... Hence, Marx was blind to three out of four fields of devel­opment. And so was the communist movement that followed. They had their eyes gouged out by materialist reductionism. That’s the Marxian Blindness. Don’t let it infect you.
>
> ... What we’re looking at is a disparaging challenge to our very biology: We are creating a society which we are biologically unequipped to grasp and thrive in. Up until now, people have been smart enough for society. These days we are, as it were, running out of cognitive fuel. We’re not suffi­ciently cognitively complex to productively relate to the society that we our­selves have created—or rather, the society that has emerged, self-organ­ized, as the complex result of our ongoing inter­actions. Luckily, there is a lot that can be done about this matter. One part of it has to do with “transhumanism”... Another part, which is more relevant to the metamodern political acti­vist, has to do with creat­ing a society that realistically manages all the diff­erent value memes and people at different levels of complexity and per­sonal develop­ment—as well as working to support the long-term advan­cement into higher value memes. As you can see, a “socialist” society is completely implausible to crea­te in any genuine or sustainable manner unless you also have perhaps over 40% of the population cognitively functional at the Postmodern value meme, which may be achievable only if we manage to surmount some developmental lim­it­ations in the population at large.
>
> ... Alright. Now, dear Watson, can you see the murder weapon? Imagine you try to create a postmodern economic system, like “socialism”, except:
>
> • there are almost no genuine socialists (in a political-psychological sense of a corresponding effective value meme);  
>
> • society is not sufficiently economically and technologically developed;  
>
> • people are all stuck in games and incentives for non-socialist mot­ives (making money, gaining power, etc.); and  
>
> • there is no postmodern culture that would support an inclu­sive multiplicity of per­spectives.

> What would happen? The society would simply fail to materialize the way you imagined. You would only be able to create it by force, never by spontaneous self-organization. And once you use force, people resist, and they get opp­ressed or killed. And once you have instituted the system by force, none of it behaves as you would expect, because in its very DNA, it is non-soc­ia­list. Hence, you get shortages, corruption and collapses. And you must respond with a reign of terror just to keep things in place, at least some­what. And lots of peo­ple die. Mystery solved. Murder she wrote.

> A Diagnosis of Our Time
>
> All of this brings us to an understanding of what is fundamentally wrong with the world of today. It’s quite simple really. It is, again, a developmen­tal im­bal­ance. Can you guess what it is? It’s the obvious fact that we have an economic and technological world-system that has advanced far ahead of the three other fields of developed . We live in an incr­ea­s­ingly global, transnational, digitized, postindustrial world-syst­em, with an increasing number of “disruptive technologies”, i.e. inve­n­tions that redefine people’s lives dramatically. But we lack a correspond­ing glob­al, transnational, digitized, post­industrial system of gov­er­nance. So the system goes tits up and crea­tes large pock­ets of econ­omic, social and cultural losers around the world: the working and middle lower class­es in affluent societies, the ex­ploited poor in poorly governed and failed states, the animals suffering under industrial farming, clim­ate change refugees and other desperate migrants, the disenfranchis­ed urb­an immigrant populations in ghettos and banlieues , the tri­bal and trad­ition­alist religi­ous popul­ations who suffer from confusion and aliena­tion, the fish and other aquatic animals, the biosphere itself. But these issues would be self-regulating if the populations, economic agents and leaders of the world were up to pace with recent develop­ments. The crux is that we are not. That’s the issue. That’s what’s wrong with the world. We lack a cultural sphere and understanding of our time, an over­arch­ing narrative that matches this new economic and technological order of the world. We, as global humanity, lack the corresponding value meme. And we display behaviors that are unsustainable and downright destruc­tive, given the current systemic circumstances. In other words, we have fallen behind in cultural, psychological and behavioral develop­ment . As noted in Book One, we live in a “retarded world”; we have developed too slowly—mentally, culturally and emotionally... Thus, we must orchestrate an extensive moral, emotional and cultural devel­opment. I am not saying, as some idealistic observers think, that we should “follow our hearts” and “return to our moral intuitions and shared values”. Rather, the point is that our moral intuitions and shared values betray us; they can and must evolve. To master this situation, to navigate the ongoing global “multi-dimen­sional crisis-revol­ution”, we must look to the subtlest and most intimate details of what it means to be a developing human being in an evolving soc­iety. It is an ironic twist of fate that, in order to solve the hard and large pro­blems of the world-system, we must learn to look in­w­ards —into our emo­tional lives and into the nature of our intimate relation­ships with our­selves, one another and our place in the universe. And we must do so, not as an individual matter of personal seeking, but as an inherently pol­itical issue that involves all members of society." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)

The following is from appendix C

> "... it makes less sense to be a class­ical libertarian, socialist, conservative or anarchist be­cause each of these pos­itions is inhe­r­ently biased towards and against mar­ket, state and civil sphere solutions respectively. They each have “pol­itical aller­gies” and infatuations limiting their pers­pectives upon all things pol­itical. In this sense, it is necessa­ry to go “beyond Left and Right”, letting go of irrational allergies and infa­t­u­a­tions... The game deniers tend to dislike and deny the aspects of competition and trade that are in fact logically necessary parts of life and society. The game accepters tend to deride and underestimate the very real aspects of solid­arity, moral concern and love, trying to explain these by red­ucing them to the “underlying hard facts” of political real­ism and crude econo­mic inter­ests. They think competition is the most real. The game change position avoids such biases against markets, states and the civil sphere, or against solidarity, competition and trade. Rather, the idea is to work for game change across all of these: to see how they interact, how they strengthen and/or impede each other." - [Nordic Ideology, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology)





Milton Friedman: “The only way that has ever been discovered to have a lot of people cooperate together voluntarily is through the free market.”1 And here are the views of another Nobel-winning conservative economist, Friedrich Hayek: “I regard the preservation . . . of the system of free markets and the private ownership of the means of production, as an essential condition of the very survival of mankind.”

> "Let me begin with the implications of mass surveillance for citizens. It is naive and just wrong to assume mass surveillance would not matter for an average citizen, who is not engaged in any criminal or terrorist activities. The number of people on lists of terror suspects comprises a million names [16]—other sources even say a multiple of this. It became known that these lists contains a majority of people who are not terrorists nor linked with any. Furthermore, since friends of friends of contact persons of suspects are also under surveillance, basically everyone is under surveillance [17]. Of course nobody would argue against preventing terrorism. However, mass surveillance [18] and surveillance cameras [19] haven’t been significantly more effective in preventing crime and terror than classical investigation methods and security measures, but they have various side effects... Recently, many people have also been chased for tax evasion. While I am not trying to defend drug misuse or tax evasion, we certainly see a concerning transition from the principle of assumed innocence to a situation where everyone is considered to be a potential suspect [24]. This is undermining fundamental principles of our legal system, and implies threats for everyone. In an over-regulated society, it is unlikely that there is anybody who would not violate any laws over the time period of a year [25]. So, everyone is guilty, in principle.
>
> ... Note that passwords of more than a billion email accounts have been illegally collected, recently [29]. This might imply that almost everyone living in a first world country can be turned into a criminal by putting illegal materials on one of their digital devices. In other words, if you stand in somebody’s way, he or she might now be able to send you to prison, even if you have done nothing wrong. The evidence against you can be easily prepared. Therefore, your computer and your mobile device become really dangerous for you. It is no wonder that two thirds of all Germans don’t trust that Internet companies and public authorities use their personal data in proper ways only; half of all Germans even feel threatened by the Internet [30]." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "Diversity and complexity are a precondition for innovation, societal resilience, and socio-economic well-being. However, we can benefit from complexity and diversity only if we allow for distributed management and self-regulating systems. This requires to restrict top-down control to what cannot be managed in a bottom-up way. That is, where the transformative potential of information and communication systems really is: information technology can now enable the social, economic and political participation and coordination that was just impossible to organize before.
>
> It is now the time for a societal dialogue about the path that the emerging digital society should take: either one that is authoritarian and top-down, or one that is based on freedom, creativity, innovation, and participation, enabling bottom-up engagement. I personally believe a participatory market society is offering the better perspectives for industrialized services societies in the future, and that it will be superior to an authoritarian top-down approach. Unfortunately, it seems we are heading towards the latter. But it is important to recognize that the dangers of the current Big Data approach are substantial, and that there is nobody who could not become a victim of it. It is crucial to understand and admit that we need a better approach, and that it was a mistake to engage into the current one." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "1.13 What Needs to be Done
>
> It is not unreasonable to be afraid of the “genie out of the bottle” that mass surveillance released. Some people consider it to be one of the things that escaped from Pandora’s Box in the aftermath of September 11. But hope never dies. What can we do? First of all, to ensure accountability, it seems necessary to record each access to personal data (including the computational operation and the exact data set it was executed on). Second, one must restore lost trust by the public, which requires a sufficient level of transparency. For example, the log files of data queries executed by secret services and other public authorities would have to be accessible to independent and sufficiently empowered supervising authorities.
>
> Similarly, log files of data queries executed by companies should be regularly checked by independent experts such as qualified scientists or citizen scientists. To be able to trust Big Data analytics, the public must know that it is scientifically sound and compliant with the values of our society and constitution. This also requires that users, customers, and citizens have a right to legally challenge results of Big Data analytics. For this, Big Data analytics must be made reproducible, such that the quality and law compliance of data mining results can be checked by independent experts.
>
> Furthermore, it should be ensured that the power of Big Data is not used against the legitimate interests of people. For example, I recommend to use it to enable people, scientists, companies and politicians to take better decisions and more effective actions rather than applying it for the sake of large-scale law enforcement. The use of Big Data for criminal investigation should, therefore, be restricted to activites that endanger the foundations of a well-functioning society. It might further be necessary to punish data manipulation and data pollution, no matter who engages in it (including secret services).
>
> Given the many instances of data manipulation today, data traces should not be considered as pieces of evidence themselves. Furthermore, for the sake of just and legitimate sanctioning systems, it must be ensured that sanctions are not applied in an arbitrary and selective way. In addition, the number of criminal investigations triggered by data analytics must be kept low and controlled by the parliament. Otherwise, in an over-regulated society, Big Data analytics might be misused by the elites to shape the society according to their taste—and this would surely end in a disaster sooner or later. In particular, the use of Big Data should not get into the way of freedom and innovation, as these are important functional success principles of complex societies." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "3.3 “Individuals and Companies Decide Rationally”
>
> The homo economicus is a widely used paradigm in economics. It is the basis of a large and beautiful body of mathematical proofs on idealized economic systems. However, the paradigm of a strictly optimizing, perfect egoist is a model, which is questioned by theoretical and empirical results. Theoretically, the paradigm assumes unrealistic information storage and processing capacities (everyone would need to have a full 1:1 representation of the entire world in the own brain and an instant data processing of huge amounts of data, including the anticipation of future decisions of others). Moreover, it has recently been found that not just a self-regarding homo economicus, but also an other-regarding homos socialis may result from the merciless forces of evolution. In fact, empirically one finds that people behave in a more cooperative and fair way than the paradigm of the homo economicus predicts. In particular, the paradigm neglects the role of errors, emotions, other-regarding preferences, etc. This implies significant deviations of real human behaviors from theoretically predicted ones.
>
> Countermeasure: Use a combination of interactive behavioral experiments, agent-based modeling, data mining, social supercomputing and serious multi-player on-line games to study (aspects of) real(istic) economic systems.
>
> 3.4 “Selfish Behavior Optimizes the Systemic Performance and Benefits Everyone”
>
> Another pillar of conventional economic thinking is the principle of the invisible hand, according to which selfish profit maximization would automatically lead to the best systemic outcome based on self-organization. It is the basis of the ideology of homogeneous unregulated markets, according to which any regulation would tend to reduce the performance of economic systems. However, models in evolutionary game theory show that self-organized coordination in markets can easily fail, even when market participants have equal power, symmetrical information etc. Moreover, even if the individually optimal behavior also maximizes system performance and if everybody behaves very close to optimal, this may still create a systemic failure (e.g. when the system optimum is unstable). Therefore, it is highly questionable whether the systemic inefficiencies resulting from competitive or uncoordinated individual optimization efforts can always be compensated for by greedy motivations (such as trying to get more than before or more than others).
>
> Countermeasures: Measure the system state in real-time and respond to this information adaptively in a way that promotes coordination and cooperation with the interaction partners. Create a ‘Planetary Nervous System’, i.e. an information and communication system supporting collective (self-)awareness of the impact of human actions on our world. Pluralistic reputation systems should be part of this. Increase opportunities for social, economic and political participation.
>
> 3.6 “More Information and Financial Innovations Are Good”
>
> One common view is that market inefficiencies result from an unequal distribution of power, which partially results from information asymmetries (knowledge is power). Therefore, providing more information to everyone should remove the related inefficiencies. However, too much information creates a cognitive information overload. As a result, people tend to orient at other people’s behaviors and information sources they trust. As a consequence, people do no longer take independent decisions, which can undermine the “wisdom of crowds” and market efficiency. One example is the large and unhealthy impact that the assessments of a few rating agencies have on the global markets. It is also believed that financial innovations will make markets more efficient by making markets more complete. However, it has been shown that complete markets are unstable. In fact, leverage effects, naked short-selling (of assets one does not own), credit default swaps, high-frequency trading and other financial instruments may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets.
>
> Countermeasures: Identify and pursue decentralized, pluralistic, participatory information platforms, which support the “wisdom of crowds” effect...

>
> 3.9 “Regulation can Fix the Imperfections of Economic Systems”
>
> When the self-organization of markets does not work perfectly, one often tries to fix the problem by regulation. However, complex systems cannot be steered like a bus, and many control attempts fail. In many cases, the information required to regulate a complex system is not available, and even if one had a surveillance system that monitors all variables of the system, one would frequently not know what the relevant control parameters are. Besides, suitable regulatory instruments are often lacking. A more promising way to manage complexity is to facilitate or guide favorable self-organization. This is often possible by modifying the interactions between the system components. It basically requires one to establish targeted real-time information feedbacks, suitable rules of the game, and sanctioning mechanisms. To stay consistent with the approach of self-organization, sanctioning should as far as possible be done in a decentralized, self-regulatory way (as it is characteristic for social norms or the immune systems).
>
> Countermeasures: Pursue a synergetic approach, promoting favorable self-organization by small changes in the interactions between the system elements, i.e. by fixing suitable rules of the game to avoid instabilities and suboptimal systemic states. (Symmetry, fairness, and balance may be such principles.) Introduce a global but decentralized and manipulation-resistant multi-criterion rating system, community-specific reputation system, and pluralistic recommender system encouraging rule-compatible behavior.
>
> 3.10 “Moral Behavior Is Good for Others, but Bad for Oneself”
>
> Species that do not strictly optimize their benefits are often assumed to disappear eventually due to the principles of natural selection implied by the theory of evolution. As a consequence, a homo economicus should remain, while moral decision-making, which constrains oneself to a subset of available options, should vanish. This problem certainly occurs, if one forces everybody to interact with everybody else on equal footing, as the concept of homogeneous markets demands. In fact, evolutionary game-theoretical models show that these are conditions under which a tragedy of the commons tends to occur, and where cooperation, fairness and trust tend to erode. On the other hand, social systems have found mechanisms to avoid the erosion of social capital. These mechanisms include repeated interactions, reputation effects, community interactions, group competition, sanctioning of improper behavior etc. In particular, decentralized market interactions seem to support fairness. Recent scientific breakthroughs even show that biological evolution can create a homo socialis’ with other-regarding preferences.
>
> Countermeasures: Promote value-sensitive designs of monetary systems and of information and communication systems. Reputation systems, for example, would be an important element of these. They can also be used to define a new kind of money, so-called ‘qualified money’. Moreover, it would be wise to introduce several co-existing, interacting, competitive exchange systems: one for anonymous (trans)actions (as we largely have them today) and one for accountable, traceable (trans)actions (creating social money or information). Additionally, one should create incentives for accountable, responsible (trans)actions and for ethical behavior." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "What would be suitable institutions for the twenty-first century? Reputation systems can transfer the success principles of social communities to our globalized society, the global village. Most people and companies care about reputation. Therefore, reputation systems could support socially oriented decision-making and cooperation, with better outcomes for everyone... reputation systems should be pluralistic, open, and user-centric. Pluralistic reputation systems are oriented at the values and quality criteria of individuals rather than recommending what a company’s reputation filter thinks is best. Self-determination of the user is central. We must be able to use different filters, choose the filters ourselves, and modify them. The diverse filters would mine the ratings and comments that people leave on the Web, but also consider how much one trusts in certain information sources.
>
> Reputation creates benefits for buyers and sellers. A recent study shows that good reputation allows sellers to take a higher price, while customers can expect a better service. Reputation systems may also promote better quality as well as socially and environmentally friendly production. This could be a new approach to reach more sustainable production, based on self-regulation rather than enforcement by laws. One day, reputation systems may also be used to create a new kind of money. The value of “qualified money” would depend on it’s reputation and thereby create incentives to invest in ways that increase a money unit’s reputation." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "Institutions supporting the “homo socialis” such as suitably designed reputation systems would enable a self-regulation of socio-economic systems. But self-regulation does not mean that everyone can choose the rules he likes. It only works with an other-regarding element. The self-regulation rules must be able to achieve a balance between the interests of everyone affected by the externalities of a decision.
>
> Other-regarding decisions can overcome the classical conflict between economic and social motives. Self-regulation could also overcome the struggle between the bottom-up organization of markets and the top-down regulation by politics. This would remove a lot of friction from our current system, making it much more efficient—in the same way as the transition from centrally planned economies to self-organized markets has often created huge efficiency gains." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "This is just the beginning of a new era, where production and public engagement will more and more happen in a bottom up way through fluid “projects”, where people can contribute as a leaders (“entrepreneurs”) or participants. A new intellectual framework is emerging, and a creative and participatory era is ahead. The paradigm shift towards participatory bottom-up self-regulation may be bigger than the paradigm shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric worldview. If we build the right institutions for the information society of the twenty-first century, we will finally be able to mitigate some very old problems of humanity. “Tragedies of the commons” are just one of them. After so many centuries, they are still plaguing us, but this needn’t be the case." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)

> "The “wisdom of crowds” requires independent information gathering and decision-making—a principle not sufficiently respected by most recommender systems. How could we, therefore, build “pluralistic” reputation and recommender systems, which support socio-economic diversity, and are also less prone to manipulation attempts? First, one should distinguish three kinds of user feedbacks: facts (linked to information allowing to check them), advertisements (if there is a personal benefit for posting them), and opinions (all other feedbacks). Second, user feedbacks could be made in an anonymous, pseudonymous, or personally identifiable way. Third, users should be able to choose among many different reputation filters and recommender algorithms. Just imagine, we could set up the filters ourselves, share them with our friends and colleagues, modify them, and rate them. For example, we could have filters recommending the latest news, the most controversial stories, the news that our friends are interested in, or a surprise filter. So, we could choose among a set of filters that we find most useful. Considering credibility and relevance, the filters would also put a stronger weight on information sources we trust (e.g. the opinions of friends or family members), and neglect information sources we do not want to rely on (e.g. anonymous ratings). For this, users would rate information sources as well, i.e. other raters. Therefore, spammers would quickly lose reputation and, with this, their influence on recommendations made." - [Thinking Ahead—Essays on Big Data, Digital Revolution, and Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27136669-thinking-ahead)









> "So, how can loose networks of peers possibly assemble goods and services that compete head-to-head with those of a large, deep-pocketed company? For one, peering taps into voluntary motivations in a way that helps assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional firms. The reason is self-selection. When people voluntarily self-select for creative, knowledge-intensive tasks they are more likely than managers to choose tasks for which they are uniquely qualified. Who, after all, is more likely to know the full range of tasks you are best qualified to perform—you or your manager?
>
> As Linus Torvalds, the originator of Linux, says: “People just selfselect to do projects where they have expertise and interest.” As long as communities have mechanisms for weeding out weak contributions, then large, self-selecting communities of people in constant communication have a higher probability of matching the best people to the right tasks than a single firm with a much smaller set of resources to work with. This applies to domains such as research and engineering as much as it does to software, education, and entertainment.
>
> ... Peering works best when at least three conditions are present: 1) The object of production is information or culture, which keeps the cost of participation low for contributors; 2) Tasks can be chunked out into bite-size pieces that individuals can contribute in small increments and independently of other producers (i.e., entries in an encyclopedia or components of a software program). This makes their overall investment of time and energy minimal in relation to the benefits they receive in return. And, finally, 3) The costs of integrating those pieces into a finished end product, including the leadership and quality-control mechanisms, must be low. Even when these conditions are present, peer production still faces obstacles. Communities need systems of peer review and leaders who can help guide and manage interactions and help integrate the disparate contributions from users. They also need to design rules for cooperation, cope with free riders, and figure out ways of motivating and coordinating collective action over long periods of time.
>
> ... For Torvalds, Linux is like a utility. It provides the basic infrastructure on which software developers can build applications and businesses. “It allows commercial entities to compete in areas that they really can add value to, and at the same time, they can take all the ‘basic stuff’ for granted,” he says. “This is especially important in software,” he continues, “where proprietary source-code at the infrastructure level can actually make it much harder for other players to enter the market. So if anything, open source is what makes capitalism in software possible at all. Without open source, you’d have just a set of monopolies: effectively, economic feudalism.” In fact, he finds it rather ironic that those favoring proprietary software would attack Linux as unfair. “At minimum they should accept it as fair competition. We don’t have proprietary lock-in, financial capital, government subsidies, distribution systems, or other advantages of private companies,” he says. “This is not socialism; it’s the opposite—it’s free enterprise.”" - [Wikinomics - How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154341.Wikinomics)

First is the problem of recognizing that you’re in a non-zero-sum game. How many car buyers are aware of how many workers in how many countries helped build their car? 
>
> Second is the problem of trust. Palestinians and Israelis are playing a non-zero-sum game, because neither is going to expel the other from the area; given the inevitability of coexistence, lasting peace would be good for both sides and lasting war bad for both. And many people on both sides see this correlation of fortunes, at least in the abstract. But it’s still hard to reach a deal because each side suspects that the other would violate it. 
>
> These two barriers to non-zero-sum solution—recognition, trust—may sound formidable, but in a sense neither is really the big problem. The big problem is something that compounds the problems of recognition and trust and also brings whole new problems to the table. The big problem is the human mind, as designed by natural selection." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "What’s good for Muslims broadly is bad for radical Muslims. If Muslims get less happy with their place in the world, more resentful of their treatment by the West, support for radical Islam will grow, so things will get worse for the West. If, on the other hand, more and more Muslims feel respected by the West and feel they benefit from involvement with it, that will cut support for radical Islam, and westerners will be more secure from terrorism." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "So what’s going on here? Where’s the part of human nature that was on display in ancient times—the part that senses whether you’re in the same boat as another group of people and, if you are, fosters sympathy for or at least tolerance of them? 
>
> It’s in there somewhere, but it’s misfiring. And one big reason is that our mental equipment for dealing with game-theoretical dynamics was designed for a hunter-gatherer environment, not for the modern world. That’s why dealing with current events wisely requires strenuous mental effort—effort that ultimately, as it happens, could bring moral progress." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "And here is the problem with feeling antipathy toward those cartoon protesters, flag burners, and even suicide bombers. It isn’t that pouring lots of sympathy on them would help things. (In some ways it could hurt.) It’s that, because of the way the human mind is built, antipathy can impede comprehension. Hating protesters, flag burners, and even terrorists makes it harder to understand them well enough to keep others from joining their ranks." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "The way hatred blocks comprehension is by cramping our “moral imagination,” our capacity to put ourselves in the shoes of another person. This cramping isn’t unnatural. Indeed, the tendency of the moral imagination to shrink in the presence of enemies is built into our brains by natural selection. It’s part of the machinery that leads us to grant tolerance and understanding to people we see in non-zero-sum terms and deny it to those we consign to the zero-sum category. We’re naturally pretty good at putting ourselves in the shoes of close relatives and good friends (people who tend to have nonzero-sum links with us), and naturally bad at putting ourselves in the shoes of rivals and enemies (where zero-sumness is more common). We can’t understand these people from the inside." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "In other words, we have trouble achieving comprehension without achieving sympathy. And this puts us in a fix because, as we’ve seen, some people it is in our profound interest to comprehend—terrorists, for example—are people we’re understandably reluctant to sympathize with." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "In short, the moral imagination, like other parts of the human mind, is designed to steer us through the successful playing of games—to realize the gains of non-zero-sum games when those gains are to be had, and to get the better of the other party in zero-sum games. Indeed, the moral imagination is one of the main drivers of the pattern we’ve seen throughout the book: the tendency to find tolerance in one’s religion when the people in question are people you can do business with and to find intolerance or even belligerence when you perceive the relationship to be instead zero-sum. 
>
> And now we see one curious residue of this machinery: our “understanding” of the motivations of others tends to come with a prepackaged moral judgment. Either we understand their motivation internally, even intimately—relate to them, extend moral imagination to them, and judge their grievances leniently—or we understand their motivation externally and in terms that imply the illegitimacy of their grievances. Pure understanding, uncolored by judgment, is hard to come by.
>
> It might be nice if we could sever this link between comprehension and judgment, if we could understand people’s behavior in more clinical terms—just see things from their point of view without attaching a verdict to their grievances. That might more closely approach the perspective of God and might also, to boot, allow us to better pursue our interests. We could coolly see when we’re in a non-zero-sum relationship with someone, coolly appraise their perspective, and coolly decide to make those changes in our own behavior that could realize non-zero-sumness. But those of us who fail to attain Buddhahood will spend much of our lives locked into a more human perspective: we extend moral imagination to people to the extent that we see win-win possibilities with them.
>
> Given this fact, the least we can do is ask that the machinery work as designed: that when we are in a non-zero-sum relationship with someone we do extend moral imagination to them. That would better serve the interests of both parties and would steer us toward a truer understanding of the other—toward an understanding of what their world looks like from the inside. 
>
> And this is what often fails to happen. The bulk of westerners and the bulk of Muslims are in a deeply non-zero-sum relationship, yet by and large aren’t very good at extending moral imagination to one another. 
>
> So a machine that was designed to serve our interests is misfiring. The moral imagination was built to help us discriminate between people we can do business with and people we can’t do business with—to expand or contract, respectively. When Americans fail to extend moral imagination to Muslims, this is their unconscious mind’s way of saying, “We judge these people to be not worth dealing with.” Yet most of them are worth dealing with.
>
> We’ve already seen one reason for this malfunction. Technology is warping our perception of the other player in this non-zero-sum game. The other player is a vast population of Muslims who, though perhaps not enamored of the West, don’t spend their time burning flags and killing westerners. But what we see on TV—and what we may conflate with this other player—is a subset of Muslims who truly, and perhaps irreversibly, hate the West. We accurately perceive the stubborn hostility of the latter and our moral imagination contracts accordingly, but in the process it excludes the former." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "No, the best way to counter the visceral aversion to extending the moral imagination is through the viscera: fight fire with fire. Remember that what our true enemies—the terrorists themselves—dearly want is for most Muslims to harbor hatred and simmering grievance. So if addressing some of the enemy’s grievances means addressing grievances of Muslims in general, that may be the best revenge against the enemies." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "The expansion and contraction of the moral imagination lies behind the pattern that has pervaded the history of religion: when a religious group senses an auspicious non-zero-sum relationship with another group, it is more likely to create tolerant scriptures or to find tolerance in existing scriptures; and when it senses no prospect of a win-win outcome, it is more likely to summon intolerance and belligerence. Humans have innate equipment for spotting people they can do business with and doing business with them, and the moral imagination is a major part of that equipment. When it opens up to a people, religious attitudes can change accordingly. That’s what we’ve seen again and again. 
>
> So how is it that the moral imagination, which right now is so badly malfunctioning, worked so well during Abrahamic history, reliably expanding to exploit non-zero-sum opportunities? Actually, it didn’t. Though I’ve emphasized the successes, there have been miscalculations aplenty, leading to lose-lose outcomes. (How many Christians and Muslims died fighting over Jerusalem during the Crusades, and what lasting profit came to either faith? And how many religions that we’ve never heard of went extinct out of a failure to skillfully play non-zero-sum games?) 
>
> What’s more, many of the successes haven’t resulted from the moral imagination working on autopilot. Ever since social organization evolved from hunter-gatherer societies to chiefdoms, the moral imagination has been working in an environment that it wasn’t designed for—so you would expect that it has often, as today, needed some coaxing to do its job well. And indeed, among the more commendable achievements of religion has been to sometimes step in and provide just that. 
>
> This coaxing goes back to the religion of chiefdoms—to the age when religion first acquired a distinct moral dimension — and it was well under way by the time Abrahamic history comes into clear view. Consider Israel’s formative stages. If you are going to build a confederacy of tribes, you need people to extend their moral imagination farther than instincts built for a hunter-gatherer milieu might dictate. Hence the Ten Commandments, and the idea that you should “love” your Israelite neighbor. An essential property of love is to be able to share in the perspective of the beloved. Similarly, if you are the apostle Paul, and you’re going to build a vast multinational religious organization within the Roman Empire, you need to stress that brotherly love should extend across ethnic bounds. And if you are building Islam, an intertribal religious organization that will then become an expanding imperial government, you have to emphasize both of those things, extending affinity beyond the bounds of tribes and of ethnicities. 
>
> These thresholds in the history of the Abrahamic faiths—and in the evolution of God—have consisted of expanding the moral imagination, carrying it to a place it doesn’t go unabetted. This expansion is religion at its best. Religion at its worst is… well, there are too many examples these days to bother elaborating.
>
> Has the best outweighed the worst? Certainly there has been a kind of net moral progress in human history, if only in the sense that moral imagination today routinely extends farther than the circumference of a hunter-gatherer village. And certainly religion has played a role in this progress. Even when the Abrahamic religions are defensive and inward-looking, you see Muslims identifying with Muslims half a world away, and Christians and Jews doing the same. In all cases, that’s a bigger moral compass than existed anywhere on this planet 20,000 years ago, when all religions were “savage” religions. Moreover, within all three of those faiths you see some people working to extend the moral imagination beyond the bounds of their particular religion. 
>
> Obviously there’s room for more progress. In fact, there’s an urgent need for it. Maybe it’s not too much to say that the salvation of the planet—the coherence and robustness of an emerging global social organization—depends on this progress. That’s what happens when the zone of non-zero-sumness reaches planetary breadth; once everybody is in the same boat, either they learn how to get along or very bad things happen. If the Abrahamic religions don’t respond to this ultimatum adaptively, if they don’t expand their moral imaginations, there is a chance of chaos on an unprecedented scale. The precursors of these religions—the ancient religions of Mesopotamia and Egypt—had it right when they depicted the triumph of chaos as the failure of the religious enterprise." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "The expansion of moral imagination can bring it into closer alignment with its original Darwinian purpose. The moral imagination was “designed” by natural selection to help us exploit non-zero-sum opportunities, to help us cement fruitfully peaceful relations when they’re available, to help us find people we can do business with and do business with them. If it is going to do that today, it has to grow." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "The expansion of the moral imagination, forces us to see the interior of more and more other people for what the interior of other people is—namely, remarkably like our own interior. Like our own interior, it is deeply colored by the emotions and passions that are our Darwinian legacy; like our own interior it in turn colors the world with self-serving moral judgment; like our own interior it possesses intrinsic value.
>
> To say that other people are people, too, may sound like an unremarkable insight. But it is one that is often ignored, and one that is in some sense unnatural. After all, any organism created by natural selection is, by default, under the illusion that it is special. We all base our daily lives on this premise—that our welfare is more important than the welfare of pretty much anyone else, with the possible exception of close kin. Indeed, the premise is that our welfare is much more important than the welfare of others. We work hard so we can afford dessert while other people don’t have dinner. We see our own resentments as bona fide grievances and we see the grievances of others as mere resentments. And we are all like this—all of us walking around under the impression that we’re special. Obviously, we can’t all be right in any objective sense. The truth must be otherwise. The extension of moral imagination brings us closer to that truth.
>
> So, in the end, the salvation of the global social system entails moral progress not just in the sense of human welfare; there has to be, as a prerequisite for that growth, a closer encounter by individual human beings with moral truth. And this is an inevitable outcome of human history. It isn’t inevitable that we’ll prevail—that our species will get close enough to moral truth to attain salvation. But it was an inevitable outcome of history’s stubborn drive toward growing non-zero-sumness that we would at least face this predicament: either move closer to moral truth or descend into chaos.
>
> I said in the previous chapter that this book isn’t the place to mount a full-fledged argument that human history has some larger purpose. But certainly one fact that would figure in such an argument is this: history has driven us closer and closer to moral truth, and now our moving still closer to moral truth is the only path to salvation—“salvation” in the original Abrahamic sense of the term: salvation of the social structure. 
>
> For Abrahamics of the Christian and Muslim variety, especially, the question of salvation doesn’t end with this Hebrew Bible sense of the term. They may ask: Does the growth of moral imagination conduce to salvation in the sense of individual salvation? Will it save my soul? That is a question for them to answer as their doctrines continue to evolve. But we can say this much: traditionally, religions that have failed to align individual salvation with social salvation have not, in the end, fared well. And, like it or not, the social system to be saved is now a global one. Any religion whose prerequisites for individual salvation don’t conduce to the salvation of the whole world is a religion whose time has passed." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "So if neither Moses nor Jesus nor Muhammad arrived on the scene with breathtaking news, and if indeed the origin of all three Abrahamic faiths can be viewed as a kind of cultural synthesis, an organic recombination of preexisting elements, what becomes of the claim that they are religions of revelation?" - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "Certainly things are looking bad for the traditional claim that they’re religions of special revelation. But there is still a sense, if a less dramatic one, in which the Abrahamic scriptures can be validly viewed as revelation. 
>
> For starters, these scriptures reveal the arrow of moral development built into human history. This revelation is cryptic, because moral progress has been fitful, with lots of backsliding—and, to compound matters, the scriptures aren’t arranged in chronological order. So messages of tolerance and belligerence, of love and hate, are mixed in seemingly random fashion. But seen in context they fall into a pattern: when people face win-win situations and think they can work together, they are open to one another’s worldviews, not to mention one another’s continued existence. So as technological evolution expands the realm of non-zero-sumness—one thing it has stubbornly done throughout history and shows every sign of continuing to do—there is incentive to acknowledge and respect the humanity of an ever widening circle of humans.
>
> Of course, this kind of scriptural “revelation”—the revealing of a pattern in history—wouldn’t by itself make most Jews, Christians, and Muslims beam with pride. After all, the most secular historical documents could be revelations in this sense. Scriptures are supposed to emanate from a divine source, from the revealer. And they’re supposed to confirm not just some vague claim about a moral pattern in history, but specific theological claims—in this case claims about whether it’s Christians or Muslims or Jews who have the details right about God and his will. 
>
> Still, there’s one way this less dramatic kind of revelation could be welcome ammunition for Abrahamics who find themselves in a theological debate—namely, if the debate finds them all on the same side. If you step back from the differences they have with one another and with other religions, you’ll see a bigger divide in modern thought. It’s between people who think there is in some sense a divine source of meaning, a higher purpose in this universe, and people who think there isn’t.
>
> On one side are people like Steven Weinberg, the Nobel Prize– winning physicist who famously wrote, “The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.” In his view, there is no transcendent source of meaning or moral orientation. “It’s not a moral order out there,” he once said. “It’s something we impose.”  1   
>
> But what the Abrahamic scriptures illustrate, however obscurely, is that there is a moral order out there—and it’s imposed on us. Built-in features of history, emanating from the basic logic of cultural evolution, give humankind a choice between progressing morally and paying a price for failing to. Hence the pattern, over the millennia, of people placing larger and larger numbers of other people within their circle of moral consideration. And hence the bursts of suffering for failing to. And hence the current, culminating moment in that pattern, a moment when the only way to avoid great and possibly catastrophic harm is to expand that moral circle across the whole planet. The march of history challenges people to expand their range of sympathy and understanding, to enlarge their moral imaginations, to share the perspective of people ever farther away. Time has drawn us toward the commonsensical-sounding yet elusive moral truth that people everywhere are people, just like us.
>
> To say that this signifies a moral order doesn’t mean order will prevail; it doesn’t mean that we’ll embrace this truth, pass the test, and usher in an age of tranquillity. Enough people may resist the truth so that, instead, chaos ensues. The moral order lies in the fact that this price will indeed be paid if moral truth doesn’t dawn widely. The moral order is the coherence of the relationship between social order and moral truth. 
>
> The fact that there’s a moral order out there doesn’t mean there’s a God. On the other hand, it’s evidence in favor of the God hypothesis and evidence against Weinberg’s worldview. In the great divide of current thought—between those, including the Abrahamics, who see a higher purpose, a transcendent source of meaning, and those, like Weinberg, who don’t—the manifest existence of a moral order comes down clearly on one side.
>
> What’s more, though believing in this moral order doesn’t make you a believer in God, it may make you, in some sense, religious. In the first chapter, when we were looking for a definition of religion broad enough to encompass the many things that have been called religion, we settled on a formulation by William James. Religious belief, he said, “consists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto.” Presumably one thing that would qualify as “our supreme good,” in James’s view, is clearly perceiving, and abiding by, moral truth. And if the unseen order is a moral one, then harmoniously adjusting yourself to it entails as much.
>
> Of course, you could interpret James’s “supreme good” in more practical terms. Our supreme good, you could say, is our survival and health, our flourishing. But even under this interpretation, the moral order revealed in the Abrahamic scriptures complies with James’s formulation. After all, the way history draws people toward moral truth is by rewarding them for moving toward it and punishing them for resisting. As technological evolution brings larger and larger swaths of people within shouting distance, they either muster the tolerance and mutual respect to do business with one another or fail to flourish. The moral order offers us the prospect of social health—salvation in the Hebrew Bible’s sense of the term—but only if we abide by its logic; only if we “harmoniously adjust ourselves” to the “unseen order.”
>
> We saw in the last chapter that the Abrahamic prophets were right at least in the sense of believing that salvation is possible so long as you know what it requires. Now we can say they were right in a deeper sense—in believing that salvation requires closer alignment with the moral axis of the universe. 
>
> Of course, they didn’t put it like that. They didn’t use phrases like “the moral axis of the universe.” They just said salvation required aligning yourself with God’s will. Then again, they believed that God’s will was the moral axis of the universe. In that sense, even if we assume that all their specific ideas about God were wrong—even if we assume that they were wrong to think there is a God—they were closer to the truth about the essence of things than Steven Weinberg is. Either there is a moral order or there isn’t. They said there is, he said there isn’t. They seem to have been right." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "When I talked about the “growth” of the Abrahamic god, it wasn’t because I feel confident that this god, or any god, exists (a question I’m unqualified to answer). It was because the god of the Abrahamic scriptures—real or not — does have a tendency to grow morally. This growth, though at times cryptic and superficially haphazard, is the “revelation” of the moral order underlying history: as the scope of social organization grows, God tends to eventually catch up, drawing a larger expanse of humanity under his protection, or at least a larger expanse of humanity under his toleration." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "For that matter, no religion has since surpassed ancient Egyptian religion in the strength of its incentive to encourage this striving: only if you strive do you get to spend eternity in bliss. As we’ve seen, pretty much all religions link social salvation to some sort of individual salvation, but eternal bliss has to rank near the top of the heap of individual salvations in terms of motivating power. Christians and Muslims matched this power, but they didn’t surpass it.
>
> These days this incentive isn’t available to everyone. Lots of people don’t believe in an afterlife—an increasing number perhaps, and certainly an increasing number of well-educated people. Lots of people don’t think of themselves as pursuing personal salvation in any other sense, either. Which raises a question: in the modern age, how do you employ the time-tested formula for strengthening the social fabric—forging a link between individual salvation and social salvation? If many people don’t seek salvation in the first place, how do you make closer adherence to moral truth a prerequisite for it?
>
> Fortunately, it turns out that everyone does seek salvation. The word “salvation,” remember, comes from a Latin word meaning to stay intact, to remain whole, to be in good health. And everyone, atheist, agnostic, and believer alike, is trying to stay in good mental health, to keep their psyche or spirit (or whatever they call it) intact, to keep body and soul together. They’re trying, you might say, to avert chaos at the individual level. 
>
> So the basic challenge of linking individual salvation to social salvation can be stated in equally symmetrical yet more secular language: the challenge is to link the avoidance of individual chaos to the avoidance of social chaos. Or: link the pursuit of psychic intactness to social intactness. Or: link the pursuit of personal integrity to social integrity. Or: link the pursuit of psychic harmony to social harmony.
>
> ... But however you describe the linkage, whatever the nature of the incentive structure, the linkage will have to be made in a fair percentage of human beings around the world for it to work. Social salvation may or may not be at hand, depending on the extent to which individual people, in working out their own salvations, expand their moral imaginations and hence expand the circle of moral consideration." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "Even if it’s true that the idea of God helped get us to our present stage of moral evolution, can’t we jettison this idea—this illusion—and go it alone from here? Can’t we pursue moral truth for the sake of moral truth? Do you really need God in order to sustain moral progress the way physicists need the electron in order to sustain scientific progress? 
>
> It depends on who “you” is. Some people can lead morally exemplary lives without the idea of God. Others need God—and not necessarily because they can lead a virtuous life only if they fear hell and long for heaven; often it’s because they can most readily lead a virtuous life if they think of moral truth as having some living embodiment. They need to feel that if they’re bad they’ll be disappointing some one and if they’re good they’ll be pleasing some one—and this one is the one whom, above all others, it is good to please and bad to disappoint.
>
> This is hardly a surprising need. After all, the human moral equipment evolved in the context of human society, as a tool for navigating a social landscape; our moral sentiments are naturally activated with respect to other beings; we are “designed” by natural selection to be good out of obligation to others, for fear of the disapproval of others, in pursuit of the esteem of others. And for many people, carrying these human relations to the superhuman level works well. They are better people, and often happier people, thinking of a God who is aware of their daily struggle and offers solace or affirmation or reprimand; they can best stay aligned with the moral axis of the universe by thanking God, asking God to help them stay righteous, seeking forgiveness from God for their lapses. It’s nice that some people can be paragons of virtue without this kind of help, but in a way it’s surprising; the natural human condition is to ground your moral life in the existence of other beings, and the more ubiquitous the beings, the firmer the ground.
>
> In other words: given the constraints on human nature, believers in God are interacting with the moral order as productively as possible by conceiving its source in a particular way, however imperfect that way is. Isn’t that kind of like physicists who interact with the physical order as productively as possible by conceiving of its subatomic sources in a particular way, however imperfect that way is?
>
> Indeed, you might even describe both forms of interaction as a kind of communication. The scientist manipulates reality in ways that implicitly say, “I think the subatomic world has a certain structure,” and then reality speaks back, providing positive or negative feedback. The scientific process—the evolution of scientific ideas—is a long dialogue with nature. As we’ve seen, the evolution of God, and the attendant evolution of our moral imagination, could be described as a long dialogue with nature, too; our species, in the course of its history, has gotten feedback that has amounted to a moral education, feedback that has steered it toward moral truth. It is the profound directionality of this evolution that leads believers to suspect that the source of this feedback is somehow deeper than nature per se." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "Is it true? Is God love? Like all characterizations of God, this one presumes more insight than I feel in possession of. But there’s certainly something to the idea that love is connected to, indeed emanates from, the kind of God whose existence is being surmised here. 
>
> The connection comes via love’s connection to the moral order of which that God is the source. That moral order has revealed itself via ever widening circles of non-zero-sumness that draw people toward the moral truth that mutual respect is warranted. As we saw in chapter 19, it is the moral imagination whose growth often paves the way for that truth, and it does so through the extension of a kind of sympathy, a subjective identification with the situation of the other. And as sympathy intensifies it approaches love. Love, you might say, is the apotheosis of the moral imagination; it can foster the most intimate identification with the other, the most intense appreciation of the moral worth of the other.
>
> Sometimes love, in the course of leading to this moral truth, fosters more mundane truths. Suppose you are a parent and you (a) watch someone else’s toddler misbehave, and then (b) watch your own toddler do the same. Your predicted reactions, respectively, are: (a) “What a brat!” and (b) “That’s what happens when she skips her nap.” Now (b) is often a correct explanation, whereas (a)—the “brat” reaction—isn’t even an explanation. So in this case love leads toward truth. So too when a parent sees her child show off and concludes that the grandstanding is grounded in insecurity. That’s an often valid explanation—unlike, say, “My neighbor’s kid is such a show-off”—and brings insight into human nature to boot. Granted, love can warp our perception, too—happens every day. (For an extreme illustration, Google “Texas Cheerleader Mom.”) Still, love at its best brings a truer apprehension of the other, an empathetic understanding that converges on the moral truth of respect, even reverence, for the other.
>
> What’s more, this empathetic understanding, the foundation of the moral imagination, might never have gotten off the ground had love not emerged on this planet. Long before history, and long before human beings, animals felt something like love for kin. And it’s a pretty good bet that when animals first felt love is when they were first able to in any sense identify with the subjective interior of another animal. To put this point in physiological language: love probably sponsored the first “mirror neurons,” a likely biological basis of the moral imagination and thus an essential element in the moral order’s infrastructure.
>
> There’s an even deeper association between love and the moral order. The expanding moral compass sponsored by the moral order, as we’ve seen, is a manifestation of non-zero-sumness, of the fact that cultural (and in particular technological) evolution leads more and more people to play non-zero-sum games at greater and greater distances. And natural selection’s invention of love, it turns out, was itself a manifestation of non-zero-sumness. Love was invented because, from the point of view of genetic proliferation—the point of view from which natural selection works—close kin are playing a non-zero-sum game; they share so many genes that they have a common Darwinian “interest” in getting each other’s genes into subsequent generations.
>
> Of course, the organisms aren’t aware of this “interest.” Even in our species—smart, as species go—the Darwinian logic isn’t conscious logic; we don’t go around thinking, “By loving my daugher I’ll be more inclined to keep her alive and healthy until reproductive age, so through my love my genes will be playing a non-zero-sum game with the copies of them that reside in her.” Indeed, the whole Darwinian point of love is to be a proxy for this logic; love gets us to behave as if we understood the logic; the invention of love, in some animal many millions of years ago, was nature’s way of getting dim-witted organisms to seek a win-win outcome (win-win from a gene’s-eye view), notwithstanding their inability to do so out of conscious strategy. And at that point the seeds of sympathy—love’s corollary, and a key ingredient of the moral imagination—were planted.

> Then, having been spawned by this biological non-zero-sumness, sympathy could be harnessed by a later wave of non-zero-sumness, a wave driven by cultural, and specifically technological, evolution. As interdependence, and hence social structure, grew beyond the bounds of family—and then beyond the bounds of hunter-gatherer band, of chiefdom, of state—the way was paved by extensions of sympathy. This sympathy didn’t have to involve its initial sponsor, love; you don’t have to love someone to trade with them or even to consider them compatriots. But there has to be enough moral imagination, enough sympathetic consideration, to keep them out of the cognitive category of enemy; you have to consider them, in some sense, one of you.
>
> And, just as we’ve seen that love can foster truth within the family, this movement of sympathy beyond the family has also advanced the cause of truth. Because the fact is that other people are one of you. For better or worse, they are driven by the same kinds of feelings and hopes and delusions that drive you. When you keep people in the category of enemy you do so by, among other feats, willful blindness to this commonality.
>
> It’s pretty remarkable: natural selection’s invention of love—in some anonymous animal many millions of years ago—was a prerequisite for the moral imagination whose expansion, here and now, could help keep the world on track; a prerequisite for our apprehension of the truth that the planet’s salvation depends on: the objective truth of seeing things from the point of view of someone else, and the moral truth of considering someone else’s welfare important. 
>
> Though we can no more conceive of God than we can conceive of an electron, believers can ascribe properties to God, somewhat as physicists ascribe properties to electrons. One of the more plausible such properties is love. And maybe, in this light, the argument for God is strengthened by love’s organic association with truth—by the fact, indeed, that at times these two properties almost blend into one. You might say that love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake, and that by partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine. Then again, you might not say that. The point is just that you wouldn’t have to be crazy to say it." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "So far, then, we would expect the following kinds of memes to be survivors in the dog-eat-dog world of cultural evolution: claims that (a) are somewhat strange, surprising, counterintuitive; (b) illuminate sources of fortune and misfortune; (c) give people a sense that they can influence these sources; (d) are by their nature hard to test decisively. In this light, the birth of religion doesn’t seem so mysterious." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "People reared in modern scientific societies may consider it only natural to ponder some feature of the world—the weather, say—and try to come up with a mechanistic explanation couched in the abstract language of natural law. But evolutionary psychology suggests that a much more natural way to explain anything is to attribute it to a humanlike agent. This is the way we’re “designed” by natural selection to explain things. Our brain’s capacity to think about causality—to ask why something happened and come up with theories that help us predict what will happen in the future—evolved in a specific context: other brains. When our distant ancestors first asked “Why,” they weren’t asking about the behavior of water or weather or illness; they were asking about the behavior of their peers." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "More than one hundred years ago Edward Tylor wrote that “spirits are simply personified causes,” but he probably didn’t appreciate, back then, how deeply natural personification is. Indeed, to talk about “personifying” causes is in a sense to get the story backward. Better to say that the modern scientific notion of a “cause” is a depersonified human being—or a depersonified god." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "So long as the strangeness of these gods didn’t get excessive, that is. Boyer says that the meme most conducive to spreading would be one that is strange but easy to think about: it might have one or two basic “ontological violations,” such as omniscience and omnipotence, but these violations wouldn’t be so numerous, or so quirky, that imagining the behavior of such a deity was unwieldy.
>
> In fact, even traits like omniscience and omnipotence seem to press against the limits of imagination. When two psychologists quizzed people about the properties of a supreme being, the answers were overwhelmingly “theologically correct”—omniscience, ubiquity, and so on. But then these same people were led to think more concretely, to imagine God actually exerting influence in specific situations. Suddenly they conjured up a more human deity. They thought of God as occupying a single point in space and being unable to do two things at once, and, in the words of one of the psychologists, “needing to see and hear in order to complete otherwise fallible knowledge.”
>
> This points to a problem for modern theology: as divinity is defined more abstractly to fit more comfortably into a scientific worldview, God becomes harder for people to relate to. In the mid-twentieth century, when Paul Tillich defined God as “the ground of being,” some fellow theologians approved, but he was also met with dismay, incomprehension, and the occasional charge of atheism. Still, he could rightly have replied that his critics suffered from innately narrow vision; being humans, they labored under the handicap of minds designed to fathom the social universe, not the universe writ large." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "Boyer believes that much of religion can be explained this way—a result of our attributing to supernatural causal agents the very human emotions that evolved to regulate reciprocal altruism; like our fellow human beings, gods are bent on enforcing their deals with us. This doesn’t mean that the grievances of gods are always just. Evil deities, Boyer says, are “enforcers of unfair deals.” But it’s only natural that there should be such unfair gods; there are, after all, unfair people." - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)

> "The number of mental tendencies involved in the creation and nourishment of religious falsehoods shouldn’t surprise us. After all, the mind was built by a process that is, strictly speaking, indifferent to truth. Natural selection favors traits that are good at getting their bearer’s genes into the next generation, period. If saying something false, or believing something false, often furthered that goal during human evolution, then the human mind will naturally encourage some kinds of falsity. This systematic muddle isn’t an exclusive property of the “primitive” mind, as John Lubbock (chapter 1) suggested; all of the above delusory tendencies have been documented in people living in modern societies—many of them students at fine universities!" - [The Evolution of God, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6340873-the-evolution-of-god)






> "War is a nation's way of eating. It promotes co-operation because it is the ultimate form of competition. Until our states become members of a large and effectively protective group they will continue to act like individuals and families in the hunting stage.

> "Nature smiles at the union of freedom and equality in our utopias. For freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies, and when one prevails the other dies. Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically, as in England and America in the nineteenth century under laissez-faire. To check the growth of inequality, liberty must be sacrificed, as in Russia after 1917. Even when repressed, inequality grows; only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed, and the best that the amiable philosopher can hope for is an approximate equality of legal justice and educational opportunity. A society in which all potential abilities are allowed to develop and function will have a survival advantage in the competition of groups." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "'Racial' antipathies have some roots in ethnic origin, but they are also generated, perhaps predominantly, by differences of acquired culture-of language, dress, habits, morals, or religion. There is no cure for such antipathies except a broadened education. A knowledge of history may teach us that civilization is a co-operative product, that nearly all peoples have contributed to it; it is our common heritage and debt; and the civilized soul will reveal itself in treating every man or woman, hmvever lowly, as a representative of one of these creative and contributory groups." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Known history shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind. The Greeks of Plato's time behaved very much like the French of modern centuries; and the Romans behaved like the English. Means and instrumentalities change; motives and ends remain the same: to act or rest, to acquire or give, to fight or retreat, to seek association or privacy, to mate or reject, to offer or resent parental care. Nor does human nature alter as between classes: by and large the poor have the same impulses as the rich, with only less opportunity or skill to implement them. Nothing is clearer in history than the adoption by successful rebels of the methods they were accustomed to condemn in the forces they deposed. Evolution in man during recorded time has been social rather than biological: it has proceeded not by heritable variations in the species, but mostly by economic, political, intellectual, and moral innovation transmitted to individuals and generations by imitation, custom, or education." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "A Pasteur, a Morse, an Edison, a Ford, a Wright, a Marx, a Lenin, a Mao T se-tung are effects of numberless causes, and causes of endless effects.
>
> In our table of character elements imitation is opposed to innovation, but in vital ways it co-operates with it. As submissive natures unite with masterful individuals to make the order and operation of a society, so the imitative majority follows the innovating minority, and this follows the originative individual, in adapting new responses to the demands of environment or survival. History in the large is the conflict of minorities; the majority applauds the victor and supplies the human material of social experiment.
>
> Intellect is therefore a vital force in history, but it can also be a dissolvent and destructive power. Out of every hundred new ideas ninety-nine or more will probably be inferior to the traditional responses which they propose to replace. No one man, however brilliant or well-informed, can come in one lifetime to such fullness of understanding as to safely judge and dismiss the customs or institutions of his society, for these are the wisdom of generations after centuries of experiment in the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones ,vill wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; and if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.
>
> So the conservative who resists change is as valuable as the radical who proposes it-perhaps as much more valuable as roots are more vital than grafts. It is good that new ideas should be heard, for the sake of the few that can be used; but it is also good that new ideas should be compelled to go through the mill of objection, opposition, and conmmely; this is the trial heat which innovations must survive before being allowed to enter the human race. It is good that the old should resist the young, and that the young should prod the old; out of this tension, as out of the strife of the sexes and the classes, comes a creative tensile strength, a stimulated development, a secret and basic unity and movement of the whole." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Even the skeptical historian develops a humble respect for religion, since he sees it functioning, and seemingly indispensable, in every land and age. To the unhappy, the suffering, the bereaved, the old, it has brought supernatural comforts valued by millions of souls as more precious than any natural aid. It has helped parents and teachers to discipline the young. It has conferred meaning and dignity upon the lowliest existence, and through its sacraments has made for stability by transforming human covenants into solemn relationships with God. It has kept the poor (said Napoleon) from murdering the rich. For since the natural inequality of men dooms many of us to poverty or defeat, some supernatural hope may be the sole alternative to despair. Destroy that hope, and class war is intensified. Heaven and utopia are buckets in a well: when one goes down the other goes up; when religion declines Communism grows." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "If another great war should devastate Western civilization, the resultant destruction of cities, the dissemination of poverty, and the disgrace of science may leave the Church, as in A.D. 476, the sole hope and guide of those who survive the cataclysm. One lesson of history is that religion has many lives, and a habit of resurrection. How often in the past have God and religion died and been reborn!" - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Puritanism and paganism-the repression and the expression of the senses and desires-alternate in mutual reaction in history. Generally religion and puritanism prevail in periods when the laws are feeble and morals must bear the burden of maintaining social order; skepticism and paganism (other factors being equal) progress as the rising power of law and government permits the decline of the church, the family, and morality without basically endangering the stability of the state. In our time the strength of the state has united with the several forces listed above to relax faith and morals, and to allow paganism to resume its natural sway. Probably our excesses will bring another reaction; moral disorder may generate a religious revival; atheists may again (as in France after the debacle of 1870) send their children to Catholic schools to give them the discipline of religious belief. Hear the appeal of the agnostic Renan in 1866:
>
> 'Let us enjoy the liberty of the sons of God, but let us take care lest we become accomplices in the diminution of virtue which would menace society if Christianity were to grow weak. What should we do without it? . . . If Rationalism wishes to govern the world without regard to the religious needs of the soul, the experience of the French Revolution is there to teach us the consequences of such a blunder.'
>
> Does history warrant Renan's conclusion that religion is necessary to morality-that a natural ethic is too weak to withstand the savagery that lurks under civilization and emerges in our dreams, crimes, and wars? Joseph de Maistre answered: "I do not know what the heart of a rascal may be; I know what is in the heart of an honest man; it is horrible." There is no significant example in history, before our time, of a society successfully maintaining moral life without the aid of religion. France, the United States, and some other nations have divorced their governments from all churches, but they have had the help of relig.ion in keeping social order. Only a few Communist states have not merely dissociated themselves from religion but have repudiated its aid; and perhaps the apparent and provisional success of this experiment in Russia owes much to the temporary acceptance of Communism as the religion (or, as skeptics would say, the opium) of the people, replacing the church as the vendor of comfort and hope. If the socialist regime should fail in its efforts to destroy relative poverty among the masses, this new religion may lose its fervor and efficacy, and the state may wink at the restoration of supernatural beliefs as an aid in quieting discontent. "As long as there is poverty there will be gods."" - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "History, according to Karl Marx, is economics in action-the contest, among individuals, groups, classes, and states, for food, fuel, materials, and economic power. Political forms, religious institutions, cultural creations, are all rooted in economic realities. So the Industrial Revolution brought with it democracy, feminism, birth control, socialism, the decline of religion, the loosening of morals, the liberation of literature from dependence upon aristocratic patronage, the replacement of romanticism by realism in fiction-and the economic interpretation of history. The outstanding personalities in these movements were effects, not causes; Agamemnon, Achilles, and Hector would never have been heard of had not the Greeks sought commercial control of the Dardanelles; economic ambition, not the face of Helen "fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of a thousand stars," launched a thousand ships on Ilium; those subtle Greeks knew how to cover naked economic truth with the fig leaf of a phrase." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "At the other end of the scale history reports that "the men who can manage men manage the men who can manage only things, and the men who can manage money manage all." So the bankers, watching the trends in agriculture, industry, and trade, inviting and directing the flow of capital, putting our money doubly and trebly to work, controlling loans and interest and enterprise, running great risks to make great gains, rise to the top of the economic pyramid. From the Medici of Florence and the Fuggers of Augsburg to the Rothschilds of Paris and London and the Morgans of New York, bankers have sat in the councils of governments, financing wars and popes, and occasionally sparking a revolution. Perhaps it is one secret of their power that, having studied the fluctuations of prices, they know that history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a wise man will hoard.
>
> The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system must sooner or later rely upon some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, police supervision, or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive, too expensive, or too transient. Normally and generally men are judged by their ability to produce-except in war, when they are ranked according to their ability to destroy.
>
> Since practical ability differs from person to person, the majority of such abilities, in nearly all societies, is gathered in a minority of men. The concentration of wealth is a natural result of this concentration of ability, and regularly recurs in history. The rate of concentration varies (other factors being equal) with the economic freedom permitted by morals and the laws. Despotism may for a time retard the concentration; democracy, allowing the most liberty, accelerates it. The relative equality of Americans before 1776 has been overwhelmed by a thousand forms of physical, mental, and economic differentiation, so that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest is now greater than at any time since Imperial plutocratic Rome. In progressive societies the concentration may reach a point where the strength of number in the many poor rivals the strength of ability in the few rich; then the unstable equilibrium generates a critical situation, which history has diversely met by legislation redistributing wealth or by revolution distributing poverty.
>
> In the Athens of 594 B.C., according to Plutarch, "the disparity of fortune between the rich and the poor had reached its height, so that the city seemed to be in a dangerous condition, and no other means for freeing it from disturbances . . . seemed possible but despotic power." 35 The poor, finding their status worsened with each yearthe government in the hands of their masters, and the corrupt courts deciding every issue against them-began to talk of violent revolt. The rich, angry at the challenge to their property, prepared to defend themselves by force. Good sense prevailed; moderate elements secured the election of Solon, a businessman of aristocratic lineage, to the supreme archonship. He devaluated the currency, thereby easing the burden of all debtors (though he himself was a creditor); he reduced all personal debts, and ended imprisonment for debt; he can­ celed arrears for taxes and mortgage interest; he established a graduated income tax that made the rich pay at a rate twelve times that required of the poor; he reorganized the courts on a more popular basis; and he arranged that the sons of those who had died in war for Athens should be brought up and educated at the government's expense. The rich protested that his measures were outright confiscation; the radicals complained that he had not redivided the land; but within a generation almost all agreed that his reforms had saved Athens from revolution.
>
> The Roman Senate, so famous for its wisdom, adopted an uncompromising course when the concentration of wealth approached an explosive point in Italy; the result was a hundred years of class and civil war...
>
> ... The government of the United States, in 1933-52 and 1960-65, followed Solon's peaceful methods, and accomplished a moderate and pacifying redistribution; perhaps someone had studied history. The upper classes in America cursed, complied, and resumed the concentration of wealth.
>
> We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natural and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peaceable partial redistribution. In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "The struggle of socialism against capitalism is part of the historic rhythm in the concentration and dispersion of wealth. The capitalist, of course, has fulfilled a creative function in history: he has gathered the savings of the people into productive capital by the promise of dividends or interest; he has financed the mechanization of industry and agriculture, and the rationalization of distribution; and the result has been such a flow of goods from producer to consumer as history has never seen before. He has put the liberal gospel of liberty to his use by arguing that businessmen left relatively free from transportation tolls and legislative regulation can give the public a greater abundance of food, homes, comfort, and leisure than has ever come from industries managed by politicians, manned by governmental employees, and supposedly immune to the laws of supply and demand. In free enterprise the spur of competition and the zeal and zest of ownership arouse the productiveness and inventiveness of men; nearly every economic ability sooner or later finds its niche and reward in the shuffle of talents and the natural selection of skills; and a basic democracy rules the process insofar as most of the articles to be produced, and the services to be rendered, are determined by public demand rather than by governmental decree. Meanwhile competition compels the capitalist to exhaustive labor, and his products to everrising excellence.
>
> There is much truth in such claims today, but they do not explain why history so resounds with protests and revolts against the abuses of industrial mastery, price manipulation, business chicanery, and irresponsible wealth. These abuses must be hoary with age, for there have been socialistic experiments in a dozen countries and centuries." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Socialism in Russia is now restoring individualistic motives to give its system greater productive stimulus, and to allow its people more physical and intellectual liberty. Meanwhile capitalism undergoes a correlative process of limiting individualistic acquisition by semisocialistic legislation and the redistribution of wealth through the "welfare state." Marx was an unfaithful disciple of Hegel: he interpreted the Hegelian dialectic as implying that the struggle between capitalism and socialism would end in the complete victory of socialism; but if the Hegelian formula of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis is applied to the Industrial Revolution as thesis, and to capitalism versus socialism as antithesis, the third condition would be a synthesis of capitalism and socialism; and to this reconciliation the Western world visibly moves. Year by year the role of Western governments in the economy rises, the share of the private sector declines. Capitalism retains the stimulus of private property, free enterprise, and competition, and produces a rich supply of goods; high taxation, falling heavily upon the upper classes, enables the government to provide for a self -limited population unprecedented services in edu­ cation, health, and recreation. The fear of capitalism has compelled socialism to widen freedom, and the fear of socialism has compelled capitalism to increase equality. East is West and West is East, and soon the twain will meet." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Hence most governments have been oligarchies-ruled by a minority, chosen either by birth, as in aristocracies, or by a religious organization, as in theocracies, or by wealth, as in democracies. It is unnatural (as even Rousseau saw) for a majority to rule, for a majority can seldom be organized for united and specific action, and a minority can. If the majority of abilities is contained in a minority of men, minority government is as inevitable as the concentration of wealth; the majority can do no more than periodically throw out one minority and set up another." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "Democracy is the most difficult of all forms of government, since it requires the widest spread of intelligence, and we forgot to make ourselves intelligent when we made ourselves sovereign. Education has spread, but intelligence is perpetually retarded by the fertility of the simple. A cynic remarked that "you mustn't enthrone ignorance just because there is so much of it." However, ignorance is not long enthroned, for it lends itself to manipulation by the forces that mold public opinion. It may be true, as Lincoln supposed, that "you can't fool all the people all the time," but you can fool enough of them to rule a large country." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "All deductions having been made, democracy has done less harm, and more good, than any other form of government. It gave to hu­man existence a zest and camaraderie that outweighed its pitfalls and defects. It gave to thought and science and enterprise the freedom essential to their operation and growth. It broke down the walls of privilege and class, and in each generation it raised up ability from every rank and place. Under its stimulus Athens and Rome became the most creative cities in history, and America in two centuries has provided abundance for an unprecedentedly large proportion of its population. Democracy has now dedicated itself resolutely to the spread and lengthening of education, and to the maintenance of public health. If equality of educational opportunity can be established, democracy will be real and justified. For this is the vital truth beneath its catchwords: that though men cannot be equal, their access to education and opportunity can be made more nearly equal. The rights of man are not rights to office and power, but the rights of entry into every avenue that may nourish and test a man's fitness for office and power. A right is not a gift of God or nature but a privilege which it is good for the group that the individual should have.
>
> In England and the United States, in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, in Switzerland and Canada, democracy is today sounder than ever before. It has defended itself with courage and energy against the assaults of foreign dictatorship, and has not yielded to dictatorship at horne. But if war continues to absorb and dominate it, or if the itch to rule the world requires a large military establishment and appropriation, the freedoms of democracy may one by one succumb to the discipline of arms and strife. If race or class war divides us into hostile camps, changing political argument into blind hate, one side or the other may overturn the hustings with the rule of the sword. If our economy of freedom fails to distribute wealth as ably as it has created it, the road to dictatorship will be open to any man who can persuasively promise security to all; and a martial government, under whatever charming phrases, will engulf the democratic world." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "The causes of war are the same as the causes of competition among individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, and pride; the desire for food, land, materials, fuels, mastery. The state has our instincts without our restraints. The individual submits to restraints laid upon him by morals and laws, and agrees to replace combat with conference, because the state guarantees him basic protection in his life, property, and legal rights. The state itself acknowledges no substantial restraints, either because it is strong enough to defy any interference with its will or because there is no superstate to offer it basic protection, and no international law or moral code wielding effective force." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

There is something greater than history. Somewhere, sometime, in the name of humanity, we must challenge a thousand evil precedents, and dare to apply the Golden Rule to nations, as the Buddhist King Ashoka did (262 B.C.),64 or at least do what Augustus did when he bade Tiberius desist from further invasion of Germany (A.D. 9) .65 Let us refuse, at whatever cost to ourselves, to make a hundred Hiroshimas in China. "Magnanimity in politics," said Edmund Burke, "is not seldom the truest wisdom, and a great empire and little minds go ill together."

Or we should follow the dismal precedent of the Holy Alliance of 18 15, and dedicate our wealth and our soundest youth to suppressing any revolt against the existing order anywhere. But we are willing to try a new approach. We respect your peoples and your civilizations as among the most creative in history. We shall try to understand your feelings, and your desire to develop your own institutions without fear of attack. We must not allow our mutual fears to lead us into war, for the unparalleled murderousness of our weapons and yours brings into the situation an element unfamiliar to history. We propose to send representatives to join with yours in a persistent conference for the adjustment of our differences, the cessation of hostilities and subversion, and the reduction of our armaments. Wherever, outside our borders, we may find ourselves competing with you for the allegiance of a people, we are willing to submit to a full and fair election of the population concerned. Let us open our doors to each other, and organize cultural exchanges that will promote mutual appreciation and understanding. Weare not afraid that your economic system will displace ours, nor need you fear that ours will displace yours; we believe that each system will learn from the other and be able to live with it in co-operation and peace. Perhaps each of us, while maintaining adequate defenses, can arrange nonaggression and nonsubversion pacts with other states, and from these accords a world order may take form within which each nation will remain sovereign and unique, limited only by agreements freely signed. We ask you to join us in this defiance of history, this resolve to extend courtesy and civilization to the relations among states. We pledge our honor before all mankind to enter into this venture in full sincerity and trust. If we lose in the historic gamble, the results could not be worse than those that we may expect from a continuation of traditional policies. If you and we succeed, we shall merit a place for centuries to come in the grateful memory of mankind."

Some conflicts are too fundamental to be resolved by negotiation; and during the prolonged negotiations (if history may be our guide) subversion would go on. A world order will come not by a gentlemen's agreement, but through so decisive a victory by one of the great powers that it will be able to dictate and enforce international law, as Rome did from Augustus to Aurelius. Such interludes of widespread peace are unnatural and exceptional; they will soon be ended by changes in the distribution of military power. You have told us that man is a competitive animal, that his states must be like himself, and that natural selection now operates on an international plane. States will unite in basic co-operation only when they are in common attacked from without.

Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man's understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life." - [The Lessons of History, by Will & Ariel Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174713.The_Lessons_of_History)

> "The surge of liberal economic thinking is, however, not without its merits. In the post-war period the public sector has grown dramatically, and at the end of the 1970s it has become highly inefficient and partly caused the wheels of industry to slow down. As a consequence, living standards are stagnating and many people have become unemployed. Change is necessary, and cutbacks in the public sector and economic deregulations during the 1980s do generate growth. The initial economic success of neoliberalism thus becomes an inspiration for a dismantling of the welfare state, which in many ways is seen as controlling and oppressive.4 Now begins the era of privatisation. The sale of state-owned companies, public institutions, schools and healthcare facilities is carried out at a brisk pace without a thorough impact assessment. Few actually investigate which public institutions benefit from being privatised and which remain inherently unfit to function on market terms. We forget that there are values that cannot be measured in money, and that there are institutions that fulfil socially important functions that cannot be left to the caprices of paying customers and profitability.
>
> Without any academic understanding of the market outside the dominating neoliberal paradigm, it becomes difficult to criticise and manage it. The market subsumes ever greater parts of society and encounters very little resistance. The system crashes repeatedly. This is not because the market is as such a bad idea or because of greedy individuals. It is rather the result of an unregulated – or more precisely, incorrectly regulated – market.
>
> The fundamental flaw of liberalism is its unequivocal focus on the individual at the cost of the society. What is good for the individual in the short term is often at odds with what is best for the greater whole. Overconsumption of cheap goods produced under dubious working conditions in poor countries may benefit the individual who buys them here and now, but in the long term it puts the wellbeing of society at risk, and eventually the life of the individual, when environmental degradation and poverty-derived conflicts cause disruptions that intrude into our personal lives.
>
> We all benefit from the wellbeing of others since it reduces the risk they will behave in hostile ways towards us, and increases the chance they will develop in ways that allow for productive and mutually beneficial cooperation with ourselves later on. Many things benefit us in our daily lives that can only be achieved through collective efforts. Not everything can be obtained by free choice on the market. If we want good roads, secure neighbourhoods and functioning legal institutions, it is necessary that we collectively make binding obligations to ensure we all contribute the necessary resources to support such measures. It cannot depend on ‘free choice’. Collective goods simply do not function very well on the market: paying for roads, cops and laws every time we need them is not very practical. But there are also other services, such as schools, hospitals and cultural institutions, that in practical terms can function on market terms, but arguably are better managed collectively – if for no other reason than it ensures that everyone can obtain access to these, even if they cannot pay. We all benefit from living in societies with educated, healthy people within a well-functioning collective imaginary.
>
> For societies to be efficient and meaningful it is required that they are based on binding obligations, collectively deliberated conventions about what is expected from the individual and what the obligations of the collective towards the individual are. This is obvious if we want to retain the rule of law and avoid regressing to an anarchy of all against all. However, if we reduce our only overarching collective structure to its most minimal functions of keeping people from physically harming one another and ensuring respect for each other’s property, then we simultaneously remove all the meaning- and identity-creating fuel of the collective imaginary that keeps it together in the first place. If society is viewed as nothing more than a physical place that facilitates our production and consumption patterns, and if the role of most other people is only to serve our material needs, with our primary relation to others limited to the exchange of services and products by monetary means, it may very well cease to be a society. Not only do we risk society falling apart, as it makes us more inclined towards questioning what we actually need each other for in case we do not gain any utility from those relations, we also risk our lives becoming emotionally impoverished. A life merely preoccupied with our own personal project and the acquisition of new possessions and pleasures is a poor one, much poorer than one characterised by a project larger than ourselves, where we together with others engage in the pursuit of a better future for all." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "However, there is something that postmodernity has not managed to address efficiently and appears completely incapable of alleviating. One of the greatest unresolved issues in our increasingly postmodern and culturally fractured age is the lack of a new commonly shared symbol world, a new metanarrative in other words. Grand collective visions that can unite the majority of the population are a scarce resource today. Thus far postmodernism has not created a new collective narrative powerful enough to curb the relentless spread of the market, which the postmodernists, partly, and rather unintentionally, have helped to unleash by refusing to propose an overarching alternative narrative." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Part of postmodernism’s failure to foster a new society has, as mentioned, to do with its hostility towards all great narratives, its propensity to always reach the antithesis, and its inherent moral relativism. But with no overarching symbol worlds shared by most of society (the ‘metanarratives’ rejected by Lyotard) and theorists never proposing new systems to replace the old, but always pursuing the antithesis, their stern reluctance towards new moral standards to stand above the always occurring relativism on the matter, it all leads us back into the claws of the market – if for no other reason because money remains the only thing to unite us. Despite the intentions of most postmodern thinkers, the lack of a common moral and political compass has opened up the door for the market to take over. There are no longer any robust ideas or enduring ideologies that can keep the market at bay. Political endeavours have been watered down and various identity projects, criticisms of norms and special interest group issues are not sufficient to withstand the sprawl of the market. For lack of hope and vivid ideas in a greater context, everyone has to fend for themselves in trying to secure personal salvation through the offerings on the market.
>
> We lack a commonly shared symbol world to give us a mutual understanding of each other, generate a greater sense of communal belongingness and help us focus our collective efforts efficiently towards a new vision of a better society for all. Consequently, we are living in a society without an overarching value system where financial values are prioritised before cultural ones. Postmodernity’s propensity towards moral relativism and emphasis on subjectivity has led to a condition where individual opinions, no matter how poorly grounded, are considered just as valid as carefully elaborated moral standards and expert knowledge. After all, in a world where everything is relative and all depends on the subjective perspective of the individual – who can say what’s better or worse anyway? Or so it may seem.
>
> We have placed ourselves in a situation where more people are in contact with each other than ever before, but we still cannot talk to each other. The primary reason is that we have not fully realised that people cognitively function within different thought perspectives and thereby think and act very differently. This is something the postmodern thought perspective has failed to address. The world is broadly speaking divided into three main thought perspectives: the religious, the rational and the postmodern. But since there is no common symbol language that all the adherents of the different perspectives can speak, the only thing that connects us is money.
>
> Further on in the book we shall explore whether it is possible to go beyond this postmodern condition and together succeed in co-creating a shared symbol language to improve communication between different symbol worlds and thought perspectives; a new overarching symbol world in which differently thinking people can reach each other.
>
> How do we increase the understanding between various symbol worlds in our increasingly fragmented and complex reality? How do we manage the growing complexity of the world in a more productive and harmonious manner? And how do we succeed in getting religious, modern and postmodern people to cooperate and live together, and live well?" - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "It is by attacking many of modern society’s established ideas and assumptions about reality that the postmodernists have been able to score some rather cheap points during the latest half-century – without trying to explain how the world actually works. The postmodernists argue that every part of reality can be explained away through seeing the greater context. They often proclaim that various parts of reality are now dead, such as God, the subject, rationality, patriarchy – yes, even the writer is now dead (despite the fact that I’m alive and well while writing these words). The things that we hitherto thought were autonomous reveal themselves through the postmodern thought perspective as merely parts of something larger, which means that the postmodern game never ends, for there is always another discourse to deconstruct within an already deconstructed discourse. However, sooner or later it tends to end for the individual postmodern critic who either tires of this constant deconstruction or eventually finds an ideology to find comfort in (usually Marxism, feminism or other schools of thought that are critical of modern society). After all, we all need some order in our worldview to obtain psychological wholeness, most postmodernists included. Rhinos or no rhinos, eventually we need to exit the room and get on with our lives.
>
> Contexts are boundless and we never finish unveiling them. But how these are part of new overarching systems is not postmodernism’s role to explain. Many postmodernists get lost in this world of contexts within contexts. This becomes problematic when they go from thinking that one context or a particular perspective is not the only or definitive one, to opining that neither has any advantages or disadvantages vis-à-vis another. When the idea of the relativity of knowledge is erroneously transferred to the area of ethics – where relativism hardly belongs – we then have what can be seen as a postmodern variant of the naturalist fallacy (the aforementioned notion that we cannot derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’). That we cannot say anything about right or wrong is arguably a fallacy, which really does not belong in postmodern philosophy that inherently is highly concerned with ethical matters. So with a paraphrase of the naturalist fallacy, we can say that some postmodern thinkers tend to wrongly derive an ‘it-doesn’t-matter’ from an ‘it-depends’. That it depends on the context is an important insight. That it then does not matter is a fallacy as erroneous as the notion that science can give us answers to ethical questions. We cannot base ethics solely on empirical investigation, but it would be dangerous to make that stop us from pursuing ethical answers.
>
> Postmodernism’s, largely implicit, view of its own pluralistic relativism as the only acceptable worldview contains some pretty obvious inherent incongruities. For instance: all truth is culturally situated, except postmodernism’s own, which is true for all cultures; there are no transcendent truths, except its own pronouncements, which transcend specific contexts; all hierarchies or value rankings are oppressive and marginalising, except its own value ranking, which is superior to the alternatives; and there are no universal truths, except its own pluralism, which is universally true for all peoples. These are, in my opinion, the cracks in postmodernism’s armour that will be the point of departure for the next thought perspective to replace it.
>
> Postmodernism can be criticised for placing cultural perspectives above all others and thus for being more interested in the representation of reality than in reality itself – as in the example of Las Vegas, where the signpost is larger and more important that the premises it boasts of. To constantly reduce everything to social constructions, and in the name of relativism even refuse to decide what is most true, reasonable or even useful, naturally becomes a rather twisted excess. Postmodernism can also be criticised for its inadequate explanatory power. By exclusively focusing on conceptual worlds, merely illuminating and visualising rather than explaining, there is a risk that the result will be that nothing is explained. The ‘why’ (perhaps the most important question within the humanities) is thus replaced by the less incisive ‘what’ and ‘how’.
>
> Postmodern theory can be accused of undermining faith in science through its perception that there is no reality outside language and that all knowledge is value-based, subjective and uncertain. But when the boundary between fact and opinion is eradicated by philosophers, it provides a fertile ground for ‘fake news’, which can then flourish on social media. There is also a risk that researchers under the influence of postmodernism become uninterested in explaining concrete reality. Instead of trying to explain material inequality and analysing economic conditions, the focus shifts towards merely exposing race, class and gender discourses and social constructions of poverty at the expense of figuring out how to actually alleviate these ills.
>
> A large part of the postmodern project has been devoted to the resistance of all hierarchies and value scales, but ultimately the old hierarchies have merely been replaced by postmodernism’s own. Implicit in this is that pluralism stands above absolutism, diversity over homogeneity, anarchy above regulations, and liberation above conventions. As such, a new value scale has snuck in.
>
> In its extreme form, moral relativism not only states that the way others perceive the world can be just as valid as one’s own, but that all ways of perceiving the world necessarily are equally valid. ‘I see the world in one way, you may see the world in another way, but both are always equally true’, the postmodern logic goes. But if all perspectives are correct there is no way of determining what should be considered better or worse. Hence, there can be no absolute values. All rankings of values, so-called value hierarchies, fall. The only correct way of viewing the world will then be the perspective of pluralist moral relativism. Since nothing according to moral relativism can be valued more highly than anything else, the question of whether we shall produce pornography or theatre, liquor or medicine, merely becomes a matter of individual consumer preferences and an issue for the market to decide. It is not even possible to value one form of governance as better than another. There is no way to determine what is right or wrong, better or worse. Gandhi or Hitler, Shakespeare or reality television, it is just a question of personal opinion and taste. Everything is relative.
>
> Moral relativism has helped bring about the pluralist society we have today. But pluralism can unfortunately become a powerful magnet for narcissism. By breaking down every form of overarching, cohesive culture, a culture which we all share and take responsibility for, the result can be that in the end it is just I and my own ego that take centre stage – an emphasis on the individual at the expense of the community. Without fixed values, ideals dissolve into subjective preferences and the interests of minority groups. It removes any shared ideals to guide our thinking, acting and collective ambitions. Moral relativism thus paves the way for the market’s dominance in our cultural sphere since that is all that remains to coordinate our collective activities.
>
> If we relativise everything, we end up with no fixed point, no overarching perspective from which to view the world. By attacking all metanarratives (except the metanarrative of the relativism of everything) we end up with a worldview in pieces without any cohesive narrative into which our observations, thoughts and experiences can be woven. Such an incoherent, fragmented view of the world can cause a sense of disorientation, a world where we as individuals do not feel we fit in anywhere. Ultimately, this may result in a rather alienated human condition. The consequence of a totally deconstructed reality, without any attempts to build a new, better metanarrative, may thus be the opposite of the human liberation most postmodernists desire.
>
> Today we seem to have approached a postmodern condition like the one described in this chapter and the last, a condition in which faith in all objective truths and shared values has been severely eroded. It has liberated us from obsolete ideologies and religions, but in the void to have emerged, many have lost the guidance and comforting social context that the narratives of yesteryear used to provide. Reality has become fluid, unpredictable, and all boundaries have been loosened. Some find empowerment and freedom in this, but many feel deprived of a steady anchoring in existence and a source of meaning and motivation.
>
> The postmodern human is both rootless and restless. Life is constantly in a state of flux with shifting roles. This has liberated the individual, but also weakened the collective as life has become an individual project where we continuously have to create our own identity and reality. Each and every person is the maker of their own happiness and no one should submit themselves to the opinions of others, but at the same time our shared culture and symbol world has been impoverished and reduced to the only common symbol language that we all share: money.
>
> As an unintended consequence, the postmodern thought perspective has thereby opened the way for the market to become our highest authority. In a world where no authorities are considered valid for all, the market forces are all that remain." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "We will in this chapter take a closer look at the market. We do this because the market is the most dominating aspect of our current collective imaginary. It has even started to dominate all the other important fictions of our current imaginary, like the nation-state and democracy. The market seems to surround us as water surrounds fish. It has come to be our enveloping social reality and therefore often rather hard to spot. Consequently, instead of us controlling it, we and our society are controlled by it. The ambition of this chapter is thus to convey the insight that we cannot let the market become our new god and that we instead start seeing it as the incomplete human creation it is.
>
> Over the last half century, the market has stealthily become the dominant ideology of the world thanks to the value vacuum of our time and the lack of any other shared narratives. The market has taken the role as our primary authority, with a language of its own that permeates most aspects of our society and culture. It has managed to become so dominant through functioning as a watered-down compromise between the rational exaggerated faith in the human being’s (i.e. the consumer’s) reason and autonomy and the postmodern age’s denial of absolute values.
>
> We often take the market for granted as though it were an inevitable force of nature, and only rarely do we manage to see or analyse it clearly. The market is an incredibly efficient tool and can serve us well, but this does not apply always and everywhere. We live with an image of, and a faith in, the market that does not comport very well with what actually happens in reality." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "As mentioned, the economists knew what they wanted: a mathematical model of Adam Smith’s belief in the invisible hand. To achieve this, they had to make the simplified assumptions that were required, even if they knew they were unrealistic. These assumptions are largely based on eliminating human subjectivity and other complicating factors from the model of the market. The economists needed to assume a number of hypothetical ideal prerequisites in order to make their model work, such as:
>
> • Rational consumers with pre-given preferences: Consumers are predictable, completely rational, and fully conscious in their decisions. Their actions are based on self-interest, they remain fully aware of what they want to buy or not, and they do not change their preferences. All market actors, including producers, simply act completely rationally in all situations. 
>
> • Individual goods: Utilities traded on the market are assumed to be of a rather simple kind that are easy to handle as individual goods in accordance with the principle of private ownership. Collective or common utilities, such as the environment, security measures or culture, do not belong to this type. 
>
> • Perfect competition: The market offers goods and services from various manufacturers that compete in terms of price and quality, and on equal terms. If one is discontented with the price or quality, there are always easily accessible alternatives available elsewhere on the market and there are no monopolies. 
>
> • Perfect information: Consumers have access to all information about commodities and potential alternatives. They are also assumed to have the necessary know-how and time to evaluate all information.
>
> The economists were also compelled to assume that both supply and demand are given beforehand. All parties are knowledgeable about what will be available on the market and what consumers want. The consumers’ firm, unalterable preferences, ‘utility functions’, mean that they will not be influenced by various factors such as new information or advertising. The consumer is assumed to maximise their utility, given these fixed utility functions, and companies are assumed only to be interested in maximising their profits. This model, with idealised, highly unrealistic assumptions, is called ‘the perfect market’.6 But this is a very unfortunate choice of words. It leads us to believe that it represents a desirable and attainable ideal condition. The perfect market is merely perfect because it fits into the mathematical formulae, nothing else. A better name would thus have been ‘the economists’ assumed market’. If so, fewer people would probably have confused the model with reality.
>
> The crux is that the market that the models describe does not exist in reality. In reality we know, for example, that advertising works, which means that we as consumers do not have given preferences. Our needs and wishes are the results of our culture, social norms and expectations, and of the marketing strategies of producers. The human being is not perfectly rational, neither as consumer or decision-maker, and competition is far from perfect in most parts of the market. Another problem with our current models is that we are forced to assume that the market always remains close to equilibrium, that supply and demand balance each other out. Today, however, we know that complex, self-organising systems never find themselves close to equilibrium. One of the things that characterises complexity is, after all, that it remains far from equilibrium. In a fully equalised market, there would be no profits to be made. The free market as we know it is full of relations far-from equilibrium to yield highly unequalised profits.
>
> The perfect market does not exist in reality, and, as we shall see, it does not behave particularly well – not even in theory. The perfect market lives its life on the desktops of theorists and is built on certain notions of efficiency. If the theory’s ideal prerequisites are fulfilled, the standard economic model predicts efficiency in the sense of profit. This is not, however, the same as the outcome, even in theory, being desirable in other respects. It is important to understand that economic efficiency in terms of profit is the only thing the model promises. No other inherent values are accounted for. It does not claim that the results are fair or ecologically sustainable, not even under the most perfect circumstances. Although it often turns out that way, the model does not even guarantee satisfied customers or suppliers.
>
> That the standard economic model can give us a simplified view of efficiency within the economy is in itself not a problem. We need simple models to make sense of complex phenomena. The great problem arose when an erroneous view of the model took hold in popular belief and we forgot that the model presumes certain unrealistic assumptions in order to be valid.
>
> In popular belief there is thus a conception of the market’s abilities that far exceeds what the economic theories ever intended; an erroneous view of the simplified market models that came to characterise much of our thinking and even made its way into political thought during the twentieth century. It is often believed that the market is fair and able to accommodate not just our individual needs but also our common needs and utilities, and that it generates positive long-term effects. But all of this is wrong and all serious contemporary economists are aware of this. And yet, the popular misconception persists. Unfortunately, this has had major implications. It governs both the general public’s and our politicians’ perception of the market. We have started to believe more in a naive image of the model than actual reality. Even if seldom expressed, certain unrealistic assumptions about the market have thus made their way into our understanding such as the beliefs:
>
> • that it is fair; that everybody gets what they deserve according to their economic abilities; 
>
> • that it favours long-term development; that market forces inevitably generate social, economic and technological progress; 
>
> • that it creates diversity; that if the market is allowed to roam freely, it will ensure the largest number of different products and services desired; 
>
> • that it considers everyone’s interests; that everyone’s needs and desires are treated as equally important: 
>
> • that it is possible to apply it for all types of utilities; that all kinds of products and services can be made available on market terms and that it is best if done so.
>
> In the following we shall look more closely at each of these common misconceptions.
>
> That the Market Is Fair
>
> Not even in theory does the market provide fairness. The distribution of resources that is considered efficient by economists has nothing to do with fairness. Fairness is quite simply irrelevant to the market. No form of fairness, no matter how we choose to define it (everyone gets what they deserve, everyone gets what they need, and so on) is a mechanism we can ascribe to the market. Quite the contrary. Economic theory shows that the market tends to fortify existing injustices and that market players are not treated equally.
>
> We like to search for human causes behind events, we want the injustices in the world to be the result of greedy people’s actions. To be sure, as an investment banker I have seen lots of greedy people – not least in the financial world. I am, however, still prepared to agree with Adam Smith that moderate greed works as the driving force of the market. However, the great problem is not the greed of individuals, but the maximisation principle we have built into the market itself: that much becomes more and little becomes less, that rich becomes richer and poor often becomes poorer. This is a greed in the market’s way of functioning that, partly due to the political influence of capital-heavy special interests, has been built into the system: if a market player is particularly efficient, the system makes sure to reward that by providing the means to expand that actor’s activities further. If one is good at making profits, more money becomes available for further growth, and with that the ability to outcompete or swallow less efficient competitors. If someone is less efficient, on the other hand, the market makes sure to limit that person or organisation’s activities and ultimately subordinate them to those that are more efficient.
>
> As such, the market does not ensure that resources are allocated to those who need them the most: this is not our current idea of economic efficiency. Rather, the efficiency it ensures is that those most capable of generating profit will experience a positive feedback loop to expand their activities while those less capable will be subordinated and limited in action by the former. In this way, the market ensures that the most profitable agents come to dominate the economy at large while the less so are pushed to the periphery.
>
> The market is therefore good at what it does, namely yielding economic efficiency in terms of profitability, but we like to believe that it is capable of doing more than this. The market can create a large number of economic resources, but the degree to which it manages to redistribute these as rationally as possible remain dubious. The market is uniquely good at baking the cake, but not at dividing it.
>
> That the Market Favours Long-term Development
>
> A certain short-sightedness seems to be built into the market through the mechanism of interest. The short-sightedness of interest can be said to hinge on the insight of our own mortality and the old behavioural-scientific truth that no organism likes to wait for its reward. For instance, consider the following thought experiment:
>
> ‘How much do you want a year from now to lend me £1,000 today? £1,010? Oh no, that’s way too little … £1,050 then? Not quite enough. How about £1,100 then? OK, we have a deal, you might agree.’
>
> As such, the price of the loan is 10% interest. But if I pay it back in ten tears? Ten years is a significant chunk of one’s life. But what about fifty years? Or 100 years? Why would anyone give up money for 100 years, even if you ended up with more in the end? Very few would agree to this because they obviously would be dead by then.
>
> Our personal mortality entails that money has greater value for us today than in the far future. Interest is a sort of compensation for the decreasing value over time. This is the foundation for interest and thus the relative short-sightedness of the market. If we had an expected life-span of twenty years, market interest would most likely be much higher; if humans could live for centuries, yearly interests would probably be much lower.
>
> This may sound quite reasonable. After all, we are all going to die and thus have good reasons to be impatient. So where lies the problem of a market that rewards quick results? The way I see it, it is unfortunate that the market sets a general market interest rate that applies to all projects. Today we only have one market interest rate, and at a level that promotes quick business success. But societies need different interest rates for 100-year-long infrastructure projects than the rate that private citizens need for car-loans and mortgages or the rate that works for entrepreneurs who seek a quick profit a few years down the line. Societies, which (hopefully) do not collapse in a few years, must be able to plan and carry out projects with a very long investment horizon. A major bridge or new railroad tracks have a life-span of more than a hundred years. Such projects can be very profitable for society in the long term, but with high market interest it often becomes rather unmanageable financially.
>
> Private consumption, long-term investments in privately owned assets such as cars or houses and public investments in infrastructure are examples of three areas that arguably should be handled with different interest rates. Today’s system however only has room for one interest rate. It simplifies and makes matters more efficient, but in many cases also extremely skewed.
>
> Future generations are not market actors who can influence today’s choices, just as they have no representation in legislation. If they had something to say, we might have seen a completely different market structure than that of today. Under such a scenario, long-term and sustainable solutions may not have been undermined by today’s short-sighted market interests.
>
> That the Market Creates Diversity
>
> In many cases the market increases the supply of different kinds of services and products, but it sometimes also has the opposite effect when the supply is limited by what provides the best revenue. In central Prague, for instance, supply is limited to crystal wares and cheap t-shirts, Mediterranean tourist destinations are totally dominated by soft drinks, sweets and sunscreen, and on Italian television there seems to be nothing but quiz shows with half-naked women on Friday nights since that is currently what yields the best advertising revenue for the TV channels. But does this mean that the citizens of Prague wear nothing but t-shirts with images of the Charles Bridge, or that Italians only want to see trifling TV entertainment with scantily clad women? No of course not, but here the market has simply yielded less diverse outcomes.
>
> What is supplied does not necessarily reflect all demands, simply what is most profitable. What we actually desire, or what we most urgently need, are not guaranteed. Sometimes, certain market conditions lead to homogenisation rather than diversity, and often the result of too narrow a focus on profit leads to cultural impoverishment. Cultural assets may be difficult to measure in economic utility, but they nonetheless remain something we consider important and enriching.
>
> That the Market Takes Everybody’s Interests into Consideration
>
> The language of the market is money, and the entrance ticket to the market is money. Money talks, but if you have no money you have no voice. As far as the market is concerned, a poor person might as well be dead. The inflow of money is the market’s only information channel. The market ignores everyone without financial resources, and since neither the people of the future nor the poor have money, the market is not fed information about their preferences and thereby no considerations are made in regards to their interests.
>
> The market pays no consideration to the environment or limited natural resources either since they are not part of the profit model. Profit is created by exploiting natural resources, maximally: every drop of oil must be extracted from the ground, and waste must be dumped in the cheapest possible way. All this as long as the consumers do not actively choose to pay for more sustainable, and costly, manufacturing methods. The same conditions apply to labour. Profit is often created by exploiting an underpaid work force in environmentally hazardous locations since this is the cheapest option. No consideration is given to these people, as long as no one with money requests this.

> Through the market we use natural resources and labour to satisfy human needs. In this process there are always revenues and expenses: We spend certain resources in order to obtain others, and if spent wisely we should end up with higher utility than we started out with. But profits and loss are only measured in terms of profitability to the producer. Environmental losses are, as mentioned, not accounted for, but neither are the actual losses and benefits for the consumer. If a transaction is good or bad to the consumer, whether it makes the person more or less happy, or whether it causes more harm than benefit, is entirely irrelevant. The degree to which the market produces things of high utility to humans is of no concern as long as it makes profits. For instance, when a patent for a medication expires and the medication becomes available at low cost to those who previously could not afford to pay, which may save lives, the lives saved will not enter the calculus, only the revenue loss of the pharmaceutical company. No consideration is taken to this in our present economic societal calculi. But this is quite strange, really, since it means that we do not measure the most important aspects to determine economic efficiency: how we consume our finite natural resources and how well we satisfy human needs.
>
> Considering ecological sustainability, and thus future generations’ chances of having as good a life as we have had, along with the actual benefits the extraction of these finite resources can provide to human lives, should be a self-evident part of our economic thinking, and determine what will be considered loss and profit. Bewilderingly, it isn’t.
>
> That It Is Possible to Use the Market for All Types of Utilities
>
> The standard economic model assumes products and services that are easy to define and measure, that can be privately owned and that are used up when consumed. This applies to many of the products that were scarce in early-industrial society, such as coal and steel, bread and potatoes, and so on, which explains why the industrial age produced an economic model revolving around such commodities. But there are a host of utilities that do not meet these requirements. There are areas that quite simply cannot be subsumed into the market without the system capsizing completely.
>
> Market thinking turns downright alarming when applied to many of society’s shared functions, the collective goods that cannot be reduced to simple consumer commodities. With the recent decades’ surge of privatisations, an increasing number of society’s collective interests have been brought to the market, such as water and electricity utilities, railways, telephone services and so on. Some of these have worked well on the market, others arguably not so much. We have got cheaper telephony, but train tickets have not become more affordable. The punctuality of public transportation has not improved either. The competition among providers of such services forces everyone on the production side to keep costs at a minimum. Privately owned service providers are usually more inclined towards cutting expenses than publicly owned. After all, the former has a profit motive, the latter does not. But in some cases, this leads to very disastrous consequences. In the case of train operators, it has resulted in inadequate maintenance of rails since rail maintenance yields no profit in the short term. At stake are passengers’ lives and health, something that is hard to measure here and now and likely to be neglected when competition threatens the profitability of private investors.
>
> Privatisations in health services, education and elderly care, which to varying degrees have swept the world in the past couple of decades, have also seen their share of unfortunate consequences. In certain countries, people have been denied life-important health care because they have not fulfilled complicated legalities in their health insurances, legal details that privately owned insurance companies have employed armies of expensive lawyers to investigate so that care can be denied and profits thereby maximised. Students have been burdened with ever-increasing fees and loans, subjecting them to a life of servitude, as a result of private universities and loan-givers seeking to maximise profits as well. In my home country of Sweden, the absurd and unforeseen consequences of school privatisations in recent years have led to a number of bankruptcies, with the result that schools have closed and children have been without basic education in their local community. Schools have even competed in guaranteeing high grades and offering more ‘fun’ and less demanding curriculums. The end-result has been a growing distrust in the grade system and pupils finishing school with poor skills in basic math, writing and reading. In many countries, the privatisation of elderly care has led to abandoned seniors, put to bed at five o’clock, often without diaper change, showered once a month and rarely offered walks outside – all in the name of increased efficiency and profitability. And being able to talk with someone, basic care in the form of someone who actually cares, is of course not part of this new concept of efficient care. The compassion and human contact, which is just as important in the care we show our fellow humans, has thus become an occasional event to occur between the more schedule-adapted work-tasks of an increasingly time-pressured staff. If profit is the main goal and the results of labour have to fit into economic calculi, less measurable tasks such as listening and consolation are likely to be rationalised away. The result is a level of service that may appear efficient on paper, but in terms of what we consider good care is below what anyone would wish for their loved-ones or themselves.
>
> ...
>
> And still we cannot simply disavow ourselves and blame the market or the owners when they are merely doing their job. There is no reason to remonstrate over the market in itself. If we hand over health care to the market, it will do its job and produce services in a cost-efficient manner: as cheaply as possible with as large a profit as possible to its owners – it’s business, so why would they do otherwise? Yet, we become livid when the profit-maximising companies weigh urine-drenched diapers in retirement homes to maximise the use of the diapers’ capacity in order to produce care at the lowest possible cost in order to pay maximal dividends to the owners. But this is precisely how the market works, it has done exactly what it is good at. If money has been saved on higher-capacity diapers, or if staff have been cut to limit the amount of unnecessary chit-chat, the market strategy has been efficient and succeeded well in the only manner in which market success can be measured: maximising profit.
>
> The Limitations of the Market
>
> If we make health insurance a private responsibility between independent market players, what sense does it make to be morally outraged about care denial when customers fail to properly investigate the legal terms of the service they have purchased? And if medication is made a market commodity like any other, it should not come as a surprise that certain medications are sold at higher prices than most can afford. If demand exceeds supply, or if a company has a patent, why should we expect them to sell their commodities at anything lower than what is most profitable? Similarly, if the goal of our education institutions is to yield profit, why should we expect them to request a lower price for their services than what they can get away with? As long as students purchase these services, why should we question the quality of their education? After all, if the students are not satisfied, they can always, as good consumers, switch to another supplier. With the privatisation of the school system, we should not be surprised either to see schools competing for customers by offering them higher grades and less demanding topics. Once again, the market has merely done its job. The customer is always right, so why should they not shop around for the best offers, and why should the market not attempt to accommodate their wishes? And if we make schools and other services subject to market terms, why are we then surprised that they close down when their businesses turn unprofitable? That is, after all, the whole point of the market: ensuring maximum profitability and making way with what does not comply with this principle.
>
> However, the better the market succeeds, the more livid we become over news reports that expose the unfortunate results of things that the market is ill-suited to accommodate. This does not mean that privatisation is only negative, we just need to more closely evaluate what privatisation can accomplish and what it cannot. The market is superbly efficient and good at what it is supposed to do, but it is not a universal institution for everything that needs to become more efficient. The market is efficient, in terms of profit, but it is blind to whatever cannot be expressed in money, and a blind efficiency is every bit as sinister as it sounds.
>
> The market is good at producing an abundance of consumer goods and selling it as cheaply as possible. This is because products and services that are easily defined and consumed fit perfectly into the logics of rational consumer behaviour. If we want to have pins, give the assignment to the market. There is no better way to efficiently produce pins. The market will ensure that the cheapest iron ore is purchased, that the most cost-efficient manufacturers are hired, and that we will have an abundance of cheaply made pins available. But the fact that the market works well for pins does not mean that it works well for everything. If we take the example of elderly care above, food and cleaning are aspects that can be expected and have proved to benefit from privatisation. If a retiree is unsatisfied with the quality or price of the food (or the staff realises that is the case), another supplier of food can be found to deliver a better and more affordable product. And if those who clean the retirement home are too sloppy or require too high wages, the managers can find someone else. Food and cleaning are aspects that can benefit from privatisation since their contents are easily defined and measured, and thus makes it simpler to weigh quality vis-à-vis costs. But when it comes to the quality and efficiency of the care itself, then we are dealing with a service that is not as easily measured and thus is not as well adapted to market terms as food and cleaning; good and compassionate care is hard to quantify. Inserting it into rational utility-optimising calculi is nearly impossible. Expecting it to reveal itself as profits on the bottom line is never going to happen. To expect people who are senile, or too weak to protest, to behave like rational consumers and find another supplier of care if they are not satisfied is not very realistic, especially if they do not have concerned enough relatives with the necessary financial means to request another service provider.
>
> The problem is not that politicians seek to improve efficiency through privatisations. After all, funds are limited, and if they succeed, there will be more resources for other things. No, the problem is that privatisations have been used rather uncritically without any understanding about when the market can be used and when it is not appropriate. Instead of carefully investigating what functions benefit from market conditions – what exactly it is that the market does and why those mechanisms would improve a given service – privatisations have become an ideologically determined measure, considered a good in itself, that without any consideration to the wider implications, and with a poor understanding of the market in the first place, has been imposed on anything its devoted advocates have mustered political support for." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "The market is an efficient, albeit blind, piece of machinery. But it is always we humans who must make the final assessment regarding the desired consequences and end-results. Without competent analysis, the market’s efficiency can yield unexpected and ultimately undesired results. We can never excuse the negative effects of the market and just refer to those as the unfortunate, but fair, will of the market forces. If things do not work on the market, it is not the will of God. It is our responsibility to change it for the better. The market is simply a tool to obtain certain goals, and when it does not, we need to find another one that works.
>
> Economic efficiency is an important value which ought to be coveted, but it is also the only value that automatically results from the market. Other human values such as dignity, fairness, sustainability and empathy must be consciously built into the market.
>
> The market has expanded into domain after domain of our society and culture, hand in hand with the postmodern worldview that made its entrance during the latter part of the twentieth century. First of all, the postmodern thought perspective has been used to legitimise the market, even though this has not the intention. When the grand ideologies fell to the wayside, very little remained to believe in. Postmodernism’s value vacuum did not contribute in setting up new overarching goals for society, hence the field was left open for the market. The market succeeded in proliferating itself for lack of a yardstick or any official value compass. Postmodern moral relativism thus became a perfect background for the market’s newly gained dominance.
>
> Efficiency has been an extremely important value throughout human history. But postmodernism’s moral relativism has allowed the market’s efficiency to spread at the expense of other values. Efficiency, such as the ability to produce great amounts of material riches, have been necessary for survival and to create tolerable lives. But in the West today we have attained such a high level of material welfare that we must ask ourselves whether it might be time to let other values matter just as much. GDP has doubled over the last thirty years, but it is questionable whether this is proportional to how much better we are feeling; whether the actual utility for the individual also has doubled?
>
> Western society is currently threatened from several corners: from the outside in the form of religious fundamentalism and burgeoning authoritarian superpowers in Asia, from the inside in the form of xenophobia and fascist tendencies. Still I do not see these as the greatest threats to the secular liberal market society, but rather the failure of the market society in symbiosis with postmodernism to create meaning; hence triggering the threat of inner, social dissolution. If the market stands alone we will experience a great number of negative consequences from the cultural and existential emptiness that it causes and that postmodernism does not seem to be able to handle.

> Previously, free capitalism was considered threatened by the socialist states. Today it is rather the Islamic world that is cast as the threat to our way of life. But Islamism is hardly a threat to our society in spite of terror attacks from radical Islamist groups and the terrible human tragedy they cause. The greatest threat to the market society is rather its own inability to create meaning and value. As early as 1945, Karl Popper described the market’s inability to generate credible meaning and value systems in The Open Society and Its Enemies. Where earlier societies’ main problem was a lack of food and material assets, in the affluent societies today, the lack of meaning and motivation, pointed out by Habermas, is one of the greatest challenges of our time.8 The market has not succeeded in creating an integrated meaning structure. Rather, the reverse seems to have occurred as the market is in the process of breaking down the meaning structures that already exist.
>
> The idea of the responsible citizen has been subjected and reduced to the market’s logic and thereby demoted to a passive consumer where political participation has been replaced by political ‘shopping’ of various producers of ‘political commodities’. And in the religious domain meaning has been reduced to a product directed at the individual’s personal needs rather than a social meaning-making context to be part of. Many things have now been subject to market adaptation, and as such lost deeper values, meaning and content.
>
> We need a deeper social context to feel that we are actually part of something meaningful. Without it, society disintegrates into a bunch of individuals that only associate as economic agents. A society cannot solely consist of consumers and producers. The market-liberal world view is impoverished, unidimensional and void of meaning in any greater sense. Alienation, which the young Marx wrote about, is a serious threat to our wellbeing, our sense of meaning and context. If individuals cannot find meaning in their life, they will deaden their existential anxiety with distractions such as vapid entertainment, alcohol, drugs and unfettered consumerism – or even self-harming behaviour or misdirected violence.
>
> The revolt against stale, conservative thought systems during the post-war years was necessary. And so were the economic liberalisations during the end of the last century. We needed to ‘tear things down to get air and light’, as August Strindberg once wrote.9 But as individuals in the society that has now emerged, we are left in a vacuum between political correctness and neoliberal emptiness.
>
> Postmodernism’s moral relativism has meant that the market has not received significant resistance and that economic efficiency has been able to spread at the expense of other human values. In our postmodern world the market has become our new fundamental authority – a secular God.
>
> But nor should we throw away the market. We must move on and as humanity take the awkward responsibility of creating new shared values with greater consciousness and insight, but still continue to use the market as the capable tool that it is. We must give up our naive popular belief in the market and become better at deciding what needs and utilities it is suitable for. We need to become better at seeing through the market, to see it for what it is." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "What is culture? Culture can be seen as that which has been ‘cultivated’ or simply created by humans, in contrast to occurrences in nature which have emerged irrespective of human activities. Often, the term is used in a much narrower sense to refer to artefacts and occurrences in the arts. In this book, however, the concept is used more broadly to refer to our collective subjectivity, the interior perspective of society if you will; the many ideas, norms and symbols that make up a society, but cannot be observed objectively. A culture is all the immaterial phenomena that exist between subjects and make up a greater whole, the intersubjective dimension of society." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "The limitations that apply to the physical world do not in the same way apply to the social world that we create. Material resources obviously remain limited in the physical domain of Popper’s W1, but since the social or collective imaginaries that make up the social domain of W3 merely consist of non-material entities that reside in the limitless imagination of our minds, how can it be that we still seem as restricted by our social reality as our physical? If money in fact is just a social construction and so easy to create, why then is there so much poverty and inequality in the world? If human beings have created things such as money and the market, could we not just change them in a way that benefits more people than they currently do? How can we change our collective imaginaries and cultural norms that determine how these surface phenomena work? And how did we create them to begin with?" - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Institutionalisation is followed by legitimisation. Legitimisation is the process that maintains institutions and makes them firmer after the connection to their origin has been broken. If an institution has become so well established that people have come to see it as an objective fact rather than a social invention, and if they have forgotten why and how it was implemented in the first place, it becomes easier to legitimise. For instance, if people believe that money has some kind of intrinsic worth of its own, and don’t just see it as a clever debt system, it then becomes easier to legitimise as a foundational pillar of society – and for governments to manipulate its use in ways that are rarely questioned. It was once necessary to write on otherwise worthless money notes that they were legal tender – ‘for all debts, public and private’, just to be sure that people understood. It was even thought necessary to stress that people had a legal obligation to accept paper money for transactions. That is hardly required any more. The institution of money currently has such strong legitimisation in our social world that few of us ever ponder its imaginary properties. And even if we do, the fact that this institution is so well established, that so many of us believe in it, means that we cannot deny its abilities to shape social reality.
>
> Legitimisation contributes to make the objectification of the institutions appear more reasonable and just. Various means are used to legitimise an institution, such as laws, norms, authority figures and symbolic customs. Many of which being institutions themselves that fortify and support each other in a positive upward spiral of mutual reinforcement and increased legitimisation.
>
> Legitimisation of an institution always entails an explanation and a defence. The explanation makes clear what role one has within the context, for instance within a social hierarchy; what designation one has and what applies in a formal sense, for example as a parent, physician, chauffeur or newlywed. The defence makes clear what applies to this role within the structure, what is right and wrong to do, think and say. A secretary, for instance, is not expected to offer any opinions on a manager’s decisions, nor is a child expected to decide how long the parent can stay out at night. The legitimisation can be divided into four levels, which can occur in parallel:
>
> • Language concepts: Language concepts can imply a certain behaviour or action, e.g. the designations ‘cousin’, ‘boss’ or ‘salesperson’, for instance, which imply a certain relationship and expected behaviour both by and to that person. The designations ‘dinner party’, ‘conference’ or ‘teaching’ also contain similar behavioural prescriptions. Many language 
concepts thus entail directives.
>
> • Simplified explanatory schedules: These comprise proverbs, idioms, moral maxims, words of wisdom, legends, folk tales, etc. An explanatory schedule is a package of sentences, values and guidelines that can provide guidance for behaviour and thinking. For example, proverbs such as ‘every man is the architect of his own fortune’ or ‘once bitten, twice shy’ harbour more comprehensive messages that can be understood at a more abstract level. A moral maxim such as ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’ provides guidance for one’s behaviour. The market’s notion of the ‘invisible hand’ can also be placed in this category.
>
> • Explicit theories: This pertains to elaborate theories that are developed and administered by specialists within an area, and that can provide specialisation for those who choose to study the theories. Such more detailed specialist knowledge may, for instance, be found within a particular research area or an academic discipline. The field can give rise to an internal, growing world with its own terminology and further explanations.
>
> • Symbolic Universe (or Collective Imaginary): This is an all-encompassing frame of reference, as all phenomena and experiences can be said to be interpreted within this symbolic totality. It entails large symbol worlds such as a certain religion or scientific tradition that refer to other realities than those that are part of daily life experiences. Symbolic Universes (like religions) appear to be fully developed and unavoidable frames of reference that create context and meaning for existence.
>
> On a societal level, symbolic Universes are protective vaults both in regards to the institutional order and the individual human’s identity. They create order by integrating experiences from various spheres into one and the same Universe of meaning. They also provide order by saying what is more or less important.
>
> Symbolic Universes also set the boundaries for what and who is included in the sphere of social reality. Occasionally they include animals, natural phenomena or inanimate objects. Other times, certain human individuals are excluded, for instance foreigners, people of other beliefs, other races, etc. In addition, the symbolic Universe designates certain hierarchies and categories to determine the social order, e.g. caste systems, gender roles, occupational status, etc.9 Another term for society’s symbolic Universe, its outermost frame of reference, is ‘metanarrative’.
>
> Berger and Luckmann’s theories can help us understand how we socially construct and reproduce our culture, how our social world in turn shapes us into the people we are and perhaps how we can make culture and the whole of our collective imaginary an object for deliberate reflection so that we can come to shape our culture, before it in turn shapes us.
>
> There are three aspects of our socially constructed reality that are particularly important in order to understand society and its development: efficiency, fairness and meaning. Hence, for every fact in our social reality we might pose three questions:
>
> • How does the fact influence the efficiency of society? How does it affect our capacity to survive and attain our objectives? 
>
> • How does the fact influence fairness in society? Who benefits from society’s efficiency, and how does it relate to what we consider reasonable? 
>
> • How does the fact influence how and the degree to which we create purpose and meaning in society? How does it relate to the way we determine the objectives of society’s efficiency, who we wish to benefit from this, who we want to have power, and the values with which it should be in accordance? In what ways does it support and direct our individual and collective meaning making? What values and actions will it promote?
>
> The efficiency, fairness and meaning aspects each correspond to one of Popper’s three worlds (although all admittedly remain highly interconnected in a number of ways). Society’s efficiency largely depends on our capacity to understand the physical World 1 and to investigate how we can generate maximum utility from observable, factual affairs. As mentioned, however, we cannot derive any ethical guidance from this objective world of is, only what works.
>
> The fairness aspect addresses that which ought to work and corresponds with the social or cultural world of World 3. Fairness is the most crucial issue within the ethics of society: who gets what? Who should be in charge of giving it to them? What are people not allowed to do? What should happen if they still do it? And who should be the ones to make all of these decisions, on which principles, and with which means and authority available to them? We can only answer these essential questions by reference to valid claims of normative rightness within World 3; and the better we understand the manifold properties and intricate mechanisms of social relations in this domain, the more justice, harmony and societal cohesion can we build into our social constructions." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "The market is a self-organising complex system, but in contrast to life, consciousness and other biological systems, it is a system that we have created ourselves – virtually without noticing it. We may not see the market as a god, yet by virtue of the power it wields in our personal lives, the way it structures our social reality and how we tend to ascribe it almost divine magical abilities, it has almost come to behave as one. If we do not gain a better understanding of the mechanisms of the market, if we see it as self-evident, and fail to expose the myths surrounding it, the danger is that we will actually allow it to become our new God.
>
> The market is a socially constructed phenomenon that only exists in our shared symbol world, Popper’s World 3. Only from the perspective of this domain can it be perceived in a meaningful manner. As such, it belongs to a type of phenomena to have emerged at the cultural stage of evolution that made a group of biological creatures capable of creating novel conceptions in their minds and externalising them in very tangible ways. The market is thus a cultural phenomenon that previous generations have invented. Now, however, it has been institutionalised in our symbolic Universe to a degree where it has come to appear to us as part of our objective reality. Rather than just a clever tool to organise society, it has become a social imaginary containing myths and illusions that we see as facts rather than the fictions they really are. If more of us did, we would probably be able to reconstruct it to generate higher levels of efficiency, fairness and meaning.
>
> The Illusion of a Free Market
>
> The market is both a self-organising complex system and a social construction. Much of the confusion that prevails in the debate about the market today is derived from the failure to realise this dual aspect. In order to think more clearly about the market, both as a self-regulating and socially constructed system, it is important that we distinguish between two sorts of rules: constitutive and regulative rules.
>
> To even function as a self-organising system, there is a need for internal rules to define the feedback mechanisms in the system, or constitutive rules with another word. Without such rules, self-organising systems cannot exist. The game of football, as an example, cannot exist without constitutive rules to define the objective of the game. In fact, if players did not agree on the rules that football is played by kicking around a ball on a field, that only goalkeepers can use their hands to catch the ball, and that the winning team are those who have kicked it into a goal the most times when the game ends, it simply would not be football. Similarly, if market participants did not agree about the right to own private property and that only the state can use organised violence to persecute those who violate this right, that economic transactions are to be voluntarily negotiated, and that money is used in the exchange of services and products, the market as we know it could not exist either. These basic conditions are not just certain characteristics of the market, they are the market. A market where no one respects non-coercive monetary transactions is just as little a market as a game where players throw around hockey pucks in a game of football.
>
> In addition to these constitutive rules, which are necessary for even starting a game, we can regulate the system with a number of regulative rules. In football, these include rules such as each team consisting of eleven players, matches being played over two periods of forty-five minutes, and goals being invalid if scored by players who are offside. What characterises a regulative rule is that it could be different without violating the constitutive rules. A game played by two teams of seven players for thirty minutes without the offside rule would still be a game of football. It is the same with the market. For example, today the market is governed by a number of regulative rules, such as capital owners being the primary stakeholders in companies, copyrights lasting seventy years after the death of the copyrighted material’s creator and limited natural resources being privately owned. However, as long as the basic constitutive rules are still upheld, a situation where other stakeholders, such as workers, the environment or the local community, also had legal rights regarding a company, or copyrights were much shorter, or natural resources could only be owned collectively would still be a market.
>
> Constitutive rules define the self-organising system, regulative rules the particular ways in which it organises itself. The constitutive rules are the ‘what’, the regulative the ‘how’... Likewise, if the market is defined by non-coercive economic transactions between individuals who can own private property protected by the state, rules to determine what should be considered private property and what should be done if anyone uses coercive means to obtain others’ property are obviously required too. So, like in football where using one’s hands can result in a penalty kick, stealing and robbing on the market is punished by fines or jail. Regulative rules are thus used to support the constitutive rules. But whereas the latter cannot be different without completely changing what the system is, the former remain open for variations. A hand foul could be penalised with a red card, and stealing could be punished by hanging. Whether we decide on one regulative rule or another depends on how we want the self-organising system to function.
>
> ... But when it comes to the market we often fail to make the distinction between these two fundamentally different types of rules. Many of the most zealous advocates of the free market, for instance, often assert that we should do away with the regulative rules all together in order to make the market function more efficiently. Here, however, they forget that the regulative rules are that which makes the market work to begin with. The ideal market, they claim, is a free market, meaning that it should be free of more or less any external regulation. However, an entirely free market, a market without any regulative rules, is just as inconceivable as free football. If we did not agree on the number of players in a football team or what the penalty should be for using one’s hands, football as a game could not function. Similarly, if we did not have any regulative rules to determine what can be traded on the market and what to do when people break the rules, the market as we know it could not function either.
>
> Just imagine what an entirely free market would look like. Without any rules to decide what could be traded, such as prohibitions on slaves, human organs and dangerous substances, for instance, or with no security regulations regarding food and medication, mechanical and electrical appliances or construction, the market would probably struggle to remain the arena of peaceful economic transactions that it is defined as today. If we wanted to create an entirely free market, what would there be to stop the sale of heroin to children, or nuclear weapons to terrorists? If supply and demand were the only sacred principles to prevail on the market, nothing would exist to prevent it from destroying itself. The absence of any regulative rules would simply make the market an increasingly dangerous place, which would lead to a lack of the very feedback processes that ensure the functionality of its constitutive rule set in the first place. So just like ‘free’ football would not be a game, an entirely free market would be something else than what we currently consider a market.
>
> Even a market free from regulative rules needs constitutive rules to start functioning in a self-organising manner. Examples of such constitutive rules are property rights and the freedom of market actors to decide the price of their products and services themselves. The outcome of this self-organising process of the market, Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’, therefore depends on how these constitutive rules have been formulated. A system without private property and extensive price regulations would therefore amount to a very different market than the one we currently have – as different as curling is to football – and hence produce very different outcomes.
>
> The way Smith’s invisible hand functions simply requires the presence of constitutive rules such as private property and the freedom of individuals to adjust their prices. As such, the invisible hand is not a force of nature, it is not the hand of God, but simply the way in which the system organises itself from the constitutive rules we ourselves have built into it. Contrary to the constitutive rules of non-random elimination in biology, those of the market have been created by us and can thus be changed if we desire. In nature, self-organising systems are not governed by deliberate actions and objectives. The ‘laws’ and regularities in physics and biology are derived from necessity, a certain logic pertaining to the iron law of existence or non-existence – to be or not to be really is the question. But with the social systems of humans, what we want them to self-organise into existence, and how, is something that we can deliberately influence.
>
> There are always external reasons as to why social systems have emerged the way they have. They have all been created by us to fill certain functions in society. Initially, the constitutive rules were created in order to give rise to certain self-organising processes which at the time were considered desirable. Thereafter they may have become increasingly self-generating, started to live their own lives, and evolved new complexity through feedback processes with the environment in ways that were often not foreseen to begin with or even considered desirable later on. As the system organises itself towards higher complexity, the way it shapes the surrounding world in turn shapes the structure and behaviour of the system itself. In a constantly changing world, the degree to which conscious actors successfully adjust the functionality of the system determines how well it keeps generating desirable outcomes. So just like biological systems, socially constructed ones only survive if they adapt to more complex circumstances. But whereas non-random elimination among organisms ensures the continuous development of new regulative biological functions (and eventually whole new constitutive ones amounting to entirely new species) so as to cope with the increasing complexity of their surroundings, human systems require conscious choices to change how they adapt to the new circumstances. ‘Non-random elimination’ is, as mentioned above, a better choice of words than ‘natural selection’ to describe the principle of biological evolution, since no one really selects what is to survive or not. Regarding human-made systems, however, someone actually has to select the constitutive and regulative functions to ensure the continuous survival of the system. If we do not make the conscious effort to do so, if we do not select what can naturally – determined by the merciless logic of existence/non-existence – accommodate our systems’ ability to self-organise patterns generating increased efficiency, justice and meaning, we will risk elimination; non-randomly that is.

> Different Markets, Different Regulations
>
> The market is a deeply political creation. Both the internal rules of companies and the external regulations on the market hinge on political decisions that were created under particular circumstances and with the purpose of serving specific interests and objectives. There are also different rules and regulations dependent on what kind of assets we are talking about, different constitutive and regulative rules to determine the functioning of different markets within the overall market economy.
>
> The real estate market, for example, does not only consist of land, piles of wooden boards and some cement, and a number of individuals who freely engage in monetary exchanges. The real estate market consists of lots of internal and external rules and regulations that determine how such economic transactions can take place, what can be traded and to whom and what can be done with the acquired property. Besides stipulating what actually constitutes a piece of real estate, a good example of a constitutive rule on the real estate market is that buyers of property acquire very strong rights of ownership to their purchases through a title deed, the official registration of the real estate. However, that does not mean that one can necessarily do everything one desires with the newly acquired property. If I buy a building in central Stockholm I might believe that I own it – that it is mine and that I can do with it what I want. But in certain cases, there are rules that limit what a buyer can do. For instance, I cannot move into the property myself if all the flats are already rented out. In Stockholm, there are regulative rules stipulating that the tenants living in ‘my’ property have the right to remain as long as they wish, provided they in turn follow the rules of the lease. And if they wish to move, they can swap their flat for someone else’s so that a person unknown to me moves into my building. In addition, I am not allowed to build an extension to the property unless the plans are approved by the city council. Also, if I purchase a property in the historical centre, I certainly cannot tear down the building I just bought. The real estate market thus consists of a number of rules to ensure the rights of tenants, the decisions of city planners and the preservation of collective cultural goods, rules that make this particular market different from other markets.
>
> The book market is another good example. Suppose I go to a bookshop and buy a book. I pay and leave the shop with a book, thinking I now rightfully own it. And yet, I do not actually own the contents of the book. The book’s copyrighted material is owned by the publisher or the author (or sometimes even the author’s grandchildren). The publisher’s and the author’s mutual contract of ownership might also entail that the author cannot do whatever they want with the text after publication. Whether it is the publisher or the author who owns the contents depends upon their, often very complicated, agreements and the copyright rules applying in the country of publication. What I have paid for is merely the right to read the book, in some cases the right to copy a few quotes in my own work if I make a formal reference to the original, but not to copy the entire book and sell it or even make it freely available online. The book market thus contains a number of particular rules that have been created to safeguard the interests of authors and publishers that differ fundamentally from those of other products.
>
> Very few commodities and services are freely exchanged on the market without any rules or regulations. It is debatable how reasonable many of these are, but the idea of an entirely free market quickly appears dubious under closer scrutiny. For instance, what would a ‘free market’ for real estate look like? How would this market function if there were no regulations to protect property owners from the damage to their property value caused by a neighbour constructing a noisy and polluting factory next to them, by a high-rise building depriving them of sunlight or by razing a historical landmark? Or how should the rental market work at all if the previous contracts were rendered null and void by the transition to a new owner? Similarly, what would the book market look like without copyright? Could this market exist at all without the protection of intellectual property? Different commodities simply require different rules in order to function on the market at all. Other examples that can be mentioned are medication, foodstuff or construction. What would a free market without any regulations regarding the safety of drugs, foods or electrical installations look like?
>
> If we were to remove all rules and regulations there would be nothing left to call a market. We often take the constitutive systems of rules for granted and do not realise how arbitrary these human-made systems are and to what degree they influence how the market behaves. But we must realise that the market – in itself – not only contains a lot of rules but, in a sense, is a collection of rules. We should therefore ask ourselves where these rules come from and whose purpose they serve. The pivotal question is then whose rules shall control the market and whose interests shall take precedence. Those of the company? The executives? The shareholders? The employees? The consumers? The state? Future generations?
>
> We simply need rules to protect the interests of as many as possible. An entirely free market, one without any regulations, does not entail more freedom overall. On the contrary, the freedom of one person often entails less freedom for someone else. The freedom of property owners to evict their tenants for no particular reason violates the tenants’ freedom from being made homeless, and the freedom to copy and freely distribute the contents of others’ books violates the freedom of authors from having their intellectual property stolen. Similarly, the freedom of manufacturers to make products anyway they like is likely to violate the consumers’ freedom from bodily harm.
>
> Removing all regulations and believing it will lead to absolute freedom is simply not feasible. We always have to consider a large number of complex variables and carefully determine how we should regulate the system in order to achieve the most benevolent end-results. It is simply naive to believe that we once and for all can make the market as free as possible and then expect that it will also be good. A free market is not a virtue in itself. Freedom, in terms of fewer regulations, does not magically equal a more ethical market. Often, quite the contrary.
>
> The Market’s Two Invisible Hands
>
> Different rules will yield different results on the self-organised market, both in terms of the number of commodities that are produced and how they are distributed. We should therefore strive towards designing the rules so that they maximise productive efficiency while also ensuring a distribution of wealth that is perceived as fair. Once the constitutive rules are optimal, there may still be a need to introduce regulative rules, but then in such a way that the loss of efficiency that often comes with regulative rules can be kept to a minimum. Admittedly, this is not an easy task. There are no clear answers to how we reach the perfect balance between these two aspects – especially not in an ever-changing world in which yesterday’s solutions become inefficient tomorrow.
>
> ... Similarly, in order to ensure that people consider the market system fair, we need certain regulations to prevent the strong from exploiting the system at the expense of the weak. If football is not seen as fair, it ceases being a game. If the market economy, which has become such an integral part of our society, is seen as too unfair, if people do not experience that it serves their interests, they will eventually rise against the system and seek to demolish it. This can have very unfortunate consequences if there are no alternatives to replace it. If we think football is unfair, we may merely refuse to play along and do something else. But if we refuse to play along with existing market rules, we may succumb to a severe case of ‘game denial’ (denying that there will always be a ‘game’ among humans regarding economic transactions given the fact that resources and opportunities remain limited. Everyone cannot get everything, which means that we need game rules to determine what we are allowed to do to acquire these finite resources). Game denial regarding the market can make the efficiency aspect disproportionally neglected in favour of equality, which can then lead to increased poverty, corruption and often violence. Soviet communism and most recently the catastrophic developments in Venezuela are sad reminders of this. As such, it is better that we seek to regulate the current market in a way that ensures the optimal balance between efficiency and fairness. To do so, it is critical that we do not see market forces as given by nature, understand that Adam Smith’s invisible hand is not that of God’s, but something we can alter to deliver more desirable results.
>
> Indeed, it would assist our understanding of the market as a self-organising system if we were to expand Smith’s metaphor to comprise two invisible hands: one that bakes the pie and one that divides it. The first hand takes care of the non-zero-sum game regarding economic efficiency, the mechanisms responsible for baking as large and beautiful a pie as possible. When it comes to this invisible hand, all of us are more or less on the same side, everyone wants a large and beautiful pie from the oven of the market. As for the other hand, we all tend to desire a larger part of the pie for ourselves. Whether we are talking about corporate lobbying activists or the political parties serving the interests of low-income groups, they all strive to influence the market in ways that distribute a larger share of the total economic output to one group or the other. The way the market constantly balances out supply and demand so as to reach an equilibrium of maximum utility, as noted by Smith, is thus only one of its self-organising mechanisms. The other is the way in which a large number of agents seek to influence who gets what. This happens in several ways, such as companies acquiring government contracts, influencing legislation in ways that benefit their particular business models, sometimes at the expense of competitors, or advocating lower corporate tax. And then there are others who seek to redistribute more resources to public welfare, increase taxes for the wealthy or limit what can be privately owned.
>
> ... In simple terms, one hand bakes the pie, another slices it into pieces of varying sizes. Once we realise that the way the market functions is a result not merely of individual consumers’ decisions, but also of joint political decisions about its rules, we can no longer hide behind the idea of a free market. It is we who must take responsibility for the outcomes in the market. Whatever it does, we allow its doing.

> Towards a Better Market
>
> ...
>
> Under favourable circumstances, the invisible hands will organise the market in a way that reaches the optimal balance between supply and demand on one hand and efficiency and fairness on the other. But there is no invisible hand (other than the lobbyists) that helps the politicians create the best rules to govern the market. How regulation is affected by the continuous flow of information provided by numerous lobbying actors demanding new rules is a self-organising system. But the political process itself is not self-organising. What is decided or not decided as a result of this process does not automatically guarantee that the rules reaching the best compromise between society’s many different special-interest groups will be implemented. Neither does it guarantee that the system as a whole manages to successfully accommodate the increasing complexity. If we fail at making the appropriate political decisions, we will risk that the market degenerates into a lower level of functionality just like when the communist planned economy succumbed to the growing demands of handling higher levels of complexity. However, with the market system it will probably not translate into empty store shelves in the near future. Rather, the contrary seems more likely to happen: an increased surplus of products that we do not really need, and that we waste precious ecological and social resources on.
>
> Today, however, there is no alternative system to outcompete a degenerated market like the market economy of the West outcompeted the planned economy in the East. Had planned economics been without competition from an already existing alternative, it would probably still be around – albeit even more inefficient. Cultural evolution often requires competition to advance at a faster pace. But where is the competition to our current market model? Would we be persuaded to deal with the market’s problems without competition from an already existing, better-functioning market system? Will we bother to realise – and deal with – the problems of the market before we have used up our entire social and ecological capital? We simply do not know yet, but the lack of competition may prevent us from evolving fast enough. If we do not react in time, we risk reaching a point where we have consumed all the resources needed for a soft transition to a sustainable economy – with the end-result that there won’t even be any stores to contain the products that we no longer manage to produce.
>
> In the following I will present a few examples of how we might improve upon the current market system in order to, among other things, make it more sustainable.
>
> As mentioned, the market consists of a number of internal and external rules and regulations that govern what the market is allowed to do. The question is how we relate to these and what we want them to accomplish. One way of preventing the market from creating things we do not want is by introducing bans on certain goods and services. Historically however, this has often proved quite a malicious path. Prohibition often creates even greater economic incentives for those who are willing to defy the ban. Since prohibition decreases the number of people willing to supply a certain commodity, the profits to be made grow that much larger. And given the risks associated with breaking the law, those who chose to do so can demand a comparably higher price for their commodities to compensate for this, thereby increasing the profitability of the enterprise even further.
>
> ...
>
> A better alternative is to try to change market forces by altering rules so as to attempt to generate more preferable outcomes. Lobbying organisations have long understood that the outcome of the market is shaped by its rules, and as activists and social entrepreneurs there is no shame in acquiring inspiration from their work methods. In this regard, the lobbying activities of the financial, pharmaceutical and media industries in the US can be particularly insightful. Various lobbying organisations have long been highly successful in influencing political decision-makers in various ways, not least through endowments, in the hope of sparking congressional decisions that serve corporate special interests. And since these conspiracies rarely become known to the public, the small risk of losing goodwill among the electorate has often left politicians willing to play along.
>
> I am, of course, not arguing that these corporate lobbying organisations are paragons or that their activities amount to fair play, merely that we could learn from those who have actually changed how the market works. It is important that we realise, as the economic power elite already has, that it is crucial to change market forces so that they will be working for whatever we want to attain. Going against the market is rarely a productive strategy. The corporate lobbying strategies have proved so successful that they should serve as inspiration for those who want to change the market for the good of humankind.
>
> In this regard, there are a number of areas in which we could direct our lobbying efforts that I will present in the following.
>
> What We Could Do Differently – Copyright
>
> ...
>
> What We Could Do Differently – Limited Companies
>
> The particular way our corporate laws and many internal rules in large companies are articulated may appear self-evident and logically necessary. However, they are more contingent than they initially appear. Since many companies use the same internal rules to govern their decision-making processes, it is tempting to suggest that they do so out of necessity. But on closer scrutiny, they are often shaped by rather arbitrary historical processes and tend to depend on customs and conventions rather than case-specific considerations. As shareholders, for instance, we usually have the right to exercise our influence once every year. But why exactly should this depend on how many days it takes for the Earth to do a lap around the sun? In some cases, it could actually be preferable to do this more often or make it an on-going process. Just because the merchants in Venice during the Italian Renaissance thought it was appropriate to gather to make decisions each spring does not mean that this should also be the case in all situations today.
>
> Our corporate laws have emerged from historical coincidences and particular conditions in the past, but we are actually free to redesign them if we like. Indeed, it would probably be advantageous if we did. In the course of centuries, the legal entity of a limited company that we have today emerged from the needs of balancing the interests of governments, those of the public and that of creating financial security and incentives for investments. Sometimes one of these priorities took primacy, sometimes another. The company has evolved through a number of different societal conditions that it had to be adapted to, from the guild system of the late medieval period, over the mercantilist economy of the colonial era, to the industrial factory economy of the nineteenth century. At every era, changes were made in order to compromise between the interests of the state, civil society and capital owners. During the mercantilist age, a corporation could own slaves and employ troops to occupy large tracts of land in foreign countries. This model was then abandoned during the industrial age, when civil society’s concerns with the liberty of individuals led to the abolition of slavery and the state’s need for security and stability made the government take over the trading corporation’s territorial possessions. Today, a corporation cannot own human beings, employ soldiers or invade foreign countries (we take that for granted, but history teaches us that it could be different), which obviously inhibits the extent of corporate interests over those of others. But it has been a long time since there have been any substantial changes to the way we legally define a company. It is basically the same construct as the one we had in the industrial age, albeit the companies we have today are much larger and sometimes even more powerful than states.
>
> ..
>
> Another historical coincidence that could have been different is the curious case of legal personhood for companies. That such artificial entities are legally equal to that of natural persons is far from self-evident. In fact, most people tend to be surprised by this circumstance the first time they hear about it. Since it is rather counterintuitive that natural persons are not considered legally above companies, it is thus easy to imagine an alternative historical development where the rights of individuals enjoyed higher protection vis-à-vis companies. If so, this could for instance have led to a higher proportion of cases where courts ruled in favour of individual humans rather than companies. We could also imagine that the legal notion of personhood would have entailed many of the things we expect from individuals, such as good public behaviour, helping others in times of need (it is actually a criminal offence to refuse someone help if their life and safety is in danger) and the obligation to serve one’s country (like that of compulsory military duty). Since companies are not as frail and mortal as we humans and generally have much larger resources at their disposal, such societal obligations could have been adapted to reflect these facts. There could thus be legal requirements for companies to spend a share of their resources on civic duties, such as the maintenance of public infrastructure in their surroundings, making their facilities available for various public activities or providing security measures in case of national emergencies. If capable, companies would thus be legally required to assist if accidents or disasters were to occur, similar to the conduct expected of individual citizens when others are in danger. We could also imagine that companies would be banned from destroying their surplus production and be legally required to donate it to the public, or that they would be obliged to participate in public hearings beyond purely legal matters where they had to listen to the interests of the public.
>
> There is also a significant discrepancy between the legal repercussions applying to natural persons and corporate personhoods. If humans break the law they can get a prison sentence with severe personal consequences as a result. If a company breaks the law, it mainly risks financial penalties – which can often be worth it. Even if managers can get prison sentences if they go against the law, the financial incentives of their company can be so great that they are encouraged to take the risk nevertheless – with the prospect of considerable legal assistance from expensive lawyers and support from government officials on the company’s payroll in case they get caught. Since companies have far greater capabilities of circumventing the legal system than natural persons, it is not unreasonable to demand that legislation should attempt to accommodate this fact by setting higher standards for companies and imposing more severe penalties when they break the law. Fines should therefore not be the only repercussion, but also include other punitive measures such as prison sentences for owners and board members overseeing the criminal conduct of managers, revoking the owners’ voting rights for a period and dismissing the current board members in favour of new ones chosen by the court, or perhaps even nationalisation with the purpose of auctioning it to the public.
>
> Even when it does not entail any legal violations, individuals are often subject to social repercussions when they behave indecently and fail to comply with the prevailing standards of good behaviour. Given their comparably larger resources, the extent to which companies can misbehave without being penalised is therefore considerably greater. To ensure that companies do not behave in ways that are otherwise considered socially unacceptable, there could thus be institutionalised arenas to scrutinise their societally immoral, but technically legal, actions and various punitive measures to encourage changes in their behaviour. Some of these things do exist in some forms and to varying degrees, but if we were to treat corporate personhoods in ways that paralleled their power, such measures would probably be more comprehensive.
>
> I am not advocating that we should necessarily make all of the above changes to the current system, merely that it is possible to imagine that corporate law could have been different if history had taken a different course. Some of these examples could serve as inspiration for improvements.
>
> There are, however, some amendments that I believe could provide more efficiency and justice to the current system:
>
> 1. Other stakeholders than owners and creditors should be given legal consideration and rights in limited companies. If employees and the local community were given voting rights and representation on the board of directors, the decision-making process would be likely to serve the interests of more people. And if societal concerns were written into corporate law and better balanced in relation to that of the profit motives of creditors and shareholders, the risks of societally important facilities being dismantled or government resorting to bailouts would be smaller. 
>
> 2. The introduction of other types of bottom lines beyond the purely financial, for instance a social and an environmental one. If a company has a very negative bottom line in terms of social responsibility and ecological sustainability, it should be subjected to external control and demands for change in the same way a negative financial bottom line does in relation to its creditors. If all companies were expected to present a positive social and ecological bottom line, the companies who emphasise these would not be at a competitive disadvantage in relation to those who do not. 
>
> 3. Shareholders should be given greater influence and extended obligations, such as keeping the board accountable for ensuring that production is socially and environmentally sustainable, that the company upholds its ethical codex, and that the company upholds its responsibilities to the local community.  
>
> 4. Limited companies’ status of personhood should be restricted and made secondary to that of natural persons. Companies should still be treated as single legal entities, but this should not entail the same rights as those of individual citizens such as the right to influence politics, unrestricted freedom of expression or liberty to always do with their property as they please. Since large companies have overwhelmingly more power than individual citizens, it can endanger our democracy if we give them the same rights. A system in which the rights of natural persons are above those of artificially conceived legal entities could balance out the disproportionate power of corporations in favour of the former.
>
> 5. Finally, we should create a number of new legal corporate forms that better encourage social entrepreneurship, sustainability and other purposes than profit alone. The current system primarily favours organisations that are either driven by profit incentives or purely devoted to charity. There is little legal consideration for those in between. But since many of the companies with the greatest prospects of fostering higher social and ecological sustainability are a kind of hybrid organisation, legislation should be adapted to better accommodate their particular needs. Many companies that strictly speaking are not non-profit organisations are still founded on other purpose-driven principles than profit and managed by decision processes, such as sociocracy and holacracy,7 involving more stakeholders than traditional profit-driven companies. Often, they also contain alternative notions of ownership. These kinds of companies currently have very little support in legislation. Changing corporate law in ways that gave such company forms higher legal recognition and protection, made them easier to register and institutionalised their principles could assist the transition to more socially responsible and ecologically sustainable business models.

> What We Could Do Differently – Taxation
>
> All economists agree that taxes have negative effects on the efficiency of the market. In my view, it would therefore be better to make the market outcome different at the outset. By doing so, we would also avoid the feeling of something rightfully deserved being taken from us. The reason for the existence of taxation is, of course, that the acquisition of economic assets with military means, basically robbing people, was the only way for the rulers of the past to fill the state coffers. We have merely inherited this system, and the principle is the same: if you don’t pay your taxes, the state’s monopoly on violence will make sure that you do. Yet if we defined the market better from the start, we would not need as extensive a redistribution system as the one we have now. Our Stone Age brains would then not make us feel robbed of something considered honestly earned. It is unwise to go against human psychology, although we may be irrational. So even if it technically does not make much difference whether we receive a large sum to begin with only to pay back a proportion later or whether we receive a smaller sum without the need for further redistribution, in psychological terms it is always preferable to aim for the latter.
>
> Income taxation could be replaced by a system in which the state derived its revenue from property rights, for example if all natural resources were considered the shared property of every citizen. All exploitation of natural resources – anything from oil extraction to air pollution – would then incur a fee. A similar system already exists in the US state of Alaska, whose inhabitants are considered the joint owners of the state’s oil resources, receiving an annual dividend accordingly. A similar principle could, if the political will is available, be implemented to encompass all of our limited natural resources. Another source of revenue could be that of fees on copyrights, as previously mentioned.
>
> As consumers we could also be charged for our use of natural resources when we purchase physical products and properties. This does in fact exist in most countries in the form of value-added tax (VAT) and yearly property taxes. The advantage of taxing people when they purchase a product is that it does not cause the same psychological penalty as income taxation. If the state derived a larger share of its revenues from VAT on physical products and to a lesser degree from income tax, it would probably make the taxation system more frictionless and thereby increase society’s overall economic efficiency. It could even improve ecological sustainability and increase employment. Higher VAT would entail higher prices on physical products and lower income tax would lower the price on human labour. In this way it could become more cost-efficient to pay people to repair and renovate old products rather than to buy new ones. The environment would benefit greatly and people struggling to find manual employment in our current hi-tech information economy would get new opportunities to make a living. This development could be further encouraged by higher VAT on environmentally damaging products and lower VAT – if any – on services.
>
> Higher property tax is another source of income that could compensate for the loss of revenue to the state if we were to abolish income tax. The advantage of taxing property is that it prevents a small number of property owners from enriching themselves at the expense of people with low incomes – who actually pay a form of tax to the owners by paying rent. Higher property tax could thus ensure that a proportion of the property owners’ profits came to serve the greater good. It would also encourage productive labour rather than speculation since the gains of owning real estate would be that much lower. As a result, society would likely become more equal, with fewer people owning a disproportionately large share of all available property, while ambitious people would probably be more inclined towards using their skills and energy on more productive endeavours than speculating in real estate. Since the richest individuals primarily derive their wealth from property and not actual work, higher property tax could compensate for the relative inequality caused by lower income tax and higher VAT.

> Let Us Create a Better Market
>
> It is impossible to imagine our current world without the market. The market is the primary engine of production and creativity, and its efficiency is central for our welfare and security. Every day we make political decisions that influence how the market works. These decisions should always be seen in relation to the three crucial aspects of society – efficiency, fairness and meaning – so that we may ask ourselves the following:
>
> • Efficiency: are we using the market in the best conceivable way? Is the market the best tool in a particular case, or should we use a different one to better accomplish what we want to do? In simple terms, will the market be able to bake the pie? 
>
> • Fairness: what distributive effects will our decisions have? Who will be the winners and who will be the losers? Can we design the rules differently to create fewer losers? How will the market, given these new rules, divide the pie? 
>
> • Meaning: what other human values, aside from economic efficiency, do we strive for on a particular issue? Ecological and social sustainability, cultural enrichment, or perhaps existential meaning? And how do we safeguard these values? Will the pie look the way we wish when we take it out of the oven?
>
> If our political decisions regarding the market were based on informed discussions about its efficiency at carrying on particular tasks, how to make it generate fairer outcomes and what exactly we want it to accomplish, we would be more likely to create a better-functioning market – decisions based on ideologically inclined convictions of being either for or against the market simply won’t. Although I am critical of the market being allowed to penetrate parts of society where it does not belong, the secular market society still remains the best foundation from which to build a better future society in my view. Even if there is a connection between the market and neoliberal, postmodern emptiness, this does not mean it cannot be used for the good. In fact, it may be one of the most powerful tools at our disposal.
>
> A hundred years ago it was much easier to get an overview of the market economy than it is today. In those days it was usually sufficient to think in terms of linearly conceived economic plans where the most important variables were accounted for, and further economic development was more predictable. Central planning functioned fairly well for a time, but during the twentieth century the world became too complex for this to ensure efficiency. The Soviet Union collapsed for the very reason that their linear way of economic thinking no longer worked. The world had become too complex. The market economy has worked better at coordinating this complexity, but recently there have been signs that we are no longer guaranteed that it will organise itself to produce the most desirable outcomes. The economy is growing, albeit slower than before, but new technologies, a vast and uncontrollable global financial market and burgeoning economies in the developing world have made it more difficult to create sufficiently well-considered economic policies. We also need to consider new phenomena such as climate change and the surprising insight that increased GDP does not automatically equal higher levels of satisfaction and continuous social advancement. There are truly more variables to consider in our hypercomplex global information society today than back when we could create a sufficiently accurate overview of the economy from the perspective of the industrial nation-state. As such, we need to increase our capacity to grasp and manage complexity above what we have previously been used to.
>
> ...
>
> The market as we conceive it today is a myth that worked well in the industrial age. But it remains a social construction that we largely imagine, not an objective fact that could not be different. It is important that we become aware of this fact if we are to change it to better accommodate increasing complexity. In the same way that we could not leave the religious thought perspective behind us before a sufficient number of us started seeing God as a social imaginary that we ourselves had created, a larger proportion of the population in modern society needs to see the market as a similar socially constructed myth if we are to move forwards. When we do that, we can see it as an object for manipulation, rather than blindly experiencing it as an all-encompassing reality that we do not grasp we are mentally embedded in.

> "If we use this model vis-à-vis an issue such as terrorism and take the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in 2015 as an example, it becomes clear how an all too low complexity level is unable to handle the problem:
>
> • At the category level, we only see things such as Islamist terrorists attacking the offices of Charlie Hebdo. The terrorists define themselves as Muslims and the editorial board defines itself as a satire publication. Concretely there is hence a need to protect satire against terrorism and Islam and to force Muslims to accept satire aimed at their religion. The solutions are thus likely to include more security measures and surveillance. 
>
> • At the connection level, more variables become visible. There is not just one type of Muslim, there is an Islamist ideology and a peaceful religion, there is a connection between immigration and alienation, there are socioeconomic factors, there is a lack of cultural capital that creates intolerance towards satire, there is resentment towards the West, there is too much testosterone and too little meaningful work for young men, especially if they have an immigrant background, etc. The proposed solutions are therefore greater social community efforts, more education, various integration projects, etc.

The social worker sees how social factors influence each other, but not how psychological aspects also play a role. The psychologist sees how various factors can affect the psyche of young people under certain circumstances and how, based on their age, they cannot handle their rage, but not the significance of religious sentiments. The imam sees how a specific variant of Islam destroys the search for context and meaning inherent in the religion, but does not have the necessary knowledge to understand the interplay of social and psychological factors in this. And so on. Society’s reply is thereby defined by those who get the task, while no one sees the whole picture. Any of these may alleviate the problem to some extent, but the lack of coordination and mutual understanding between different perspectives can make their efforts less efficient and sometimes even futile.
>
> • At the perspective level, we attempt to understand the personal perspective of those who react violently and harbour antagonistic feelings towards society. We wonder why a society with so much to offer still creates so much personal and collective anger and so little meaning that young men become terrorists, and accordingly attempt to find out how those factors and perspectives are connected. Our response thus becomes a string of questions that do revolve not only around economic, social and religious issues here and now, but also as intimately connected processes over time. We then try to identify the structural developmental changes needed for young people with immigrant backgrounds to feel hope, meaning and a sense of belongingness in society. The perspective level has a deeper existential understanding of individuals and society – and the history of both. We thus attempt to combine the many informed perspectives on terrorism, religious fundamentalism, social marginalisation and security measures to find the optimal coordination between these to solve the problem.
>
> From the discussion above we understand that in a more and more complex world, the ability to understand the world in more complex terms becomes more and more important. The increase in outer complexity in the world will have to be met by an increase in the inner, cognitive complexity of our minds.
>
> When we look at psychological research on children’s development, it is evident we humans go through various cognitive stages of development as we mature. Earlier developmental models about our ability to handle complexity usually ended with a stage corresponding to the connection level. However, today we have good reasons to believe this isn’t the final stage of cognitive complexity; that some individuals develop beyond this level during their adult life.
>
> Typically adult cognitive development is understood in quantitative terms such as experiences, knowledge, specific competences or abilities and the like, with the basic assumption that the qualitative or transformative cognitive development ground to a halt after the teen years. The focus has been on the content of our consciousness rather than our consciousness’s ability for scope and complexity.
>
> But as we shall see in the next chapter, modern developmental psychology of today has shown that we as individuals have great variation in how complex a question or reasoning we can handle at a given age.4 It also proves that our ability to handle complexity is not fully developed at an early adult age, but the ability of our consciousness to handle complexity can continue to develop throughout life.
>
> In the same way that it was necessary with a population that could function at a higher complexity level to get our modern society to work, it also seems reasonable to assume that we need a population that has the ability to act from thinking that corresponds to the world’s increasing complexity in the global society of the future.
>
> We cannot, however, expect that it will happen in and of itself. The development is rapidly complexifying, and if we do not react quickly, we risk the collapse of our political system as well as the entire biosphere. We only have our Stone Age brain to rely on, so the only solution is – once again – to reshape our symbol world in a way that favours a sustainable development. The big question then becomes how we can create the best frameworks for the development of humanity, so that as many as possible can act from the higher complexity levels needed. How can we make sure that as many as possible reach a level of personal development during the course of life that makes it possible for more people to develop an understanding and feel for the complex problems humanity stands before? The survival of democracy and of our planet depends upon this.

>
> As a result of the increasing complexity, we have throughout history undergone a number of paradigm shifts in which we started to think differently and see the world and ourselves with new eyes. A paradigm is how we collectively think, rather than what we think...
>
> Paradigms are constituted by our thoughts about how the world works and how we should best go about trying to understand it. In philosophical terms, our paradigms are formed by our ontology and our epistemology. Paradigm shifts typically happen when both our ontology and epistemology are altered, and both of these are anchored in our symbol world. This is when our symbol world changes – for example, when a newly dominant thought perspective has prevailed, as a result of technological development or new scientific breakthroughs, such as Darwin’s theory of evolution or new philosophical insights; or when someone creates great art or popular culture that makes us view the world differently.
>
> ...
>
> If we look at the development of the scientific paradigms that have supplanted each other throughout the ages, the historical trajectory, as we saw in Part 1, looks something like this:
>
> 1. During the Renaissance and the Enlightenment both the Bible and Aristotle are questioned, and especially by Newton the mechanistic worldview is developed.
>
> 2. With the steam engine, thermodynamics is one shift away from the mechanistic worldview.
>
> 3. Einstein develops the theory of relativity but still has a strictly causal view on cause and effect.
>
> 4. Bohr and Heisenberg discover quantum mechanics, which holds true at atom-level, where cause and effect according to our usual assumptions are disconnected from each other. Quantum ontology and therein the quantum paradigms that are developed from it break radically with ordinary human experience of the world.
>
> 5. With computers it becomes possible to find completely new patterns in data, and from there theories on complexity, networks, chaos and self-organising systems are developed. Complexity theory’s explanation of emergent phenomena allows us to comprehend how life, consciousness and culture have arisen out of matter and we can start to regard ourselves as open systems instead of merely individuals.
>
> All these scientific paradigms define not only what we can understand but how. They were and are frameworks for how we can understand our environments, and they were developed because the prevailing paradigm was no longer sufficiently explanatory.
>
> Paradigm shifts are scarcely easy to predict, and often arrive with bombastic claims that may require equally incisive evidence. The allergens that guard against charlatanism or simple error in disciplines must, when a justified paradigm shift arrives, be combatted by insurgents who often do the thankless work of questioning fundamental principles. This is in contrast with usual scientific work, which engages well-defined research questions within the given paradigm. Rather than rocking the boat, most researchers add to it, expanding its hull and following the set course that previous revolutionary thinkers laid down. It is only once a critical mass of evidence has been reached, and it has overcome the social struggle of winning over territorially minded and rigorously defensive (for good cause) scientists, that one paradigm can usurp another.

> Our worldview has for some time been so dominated by the rational thought perspective that it is not surprising it faces a backlash from the post-rationalist postmodern thought perspective. Similarly, we should not be shocked if the allergies of members of both camps are sparked by our all too human ability to read what we want to understand, and ascribe the motives we assume our ‘antagonists’ hold. We are replete with biases, and to pretend otherwise is to abscond from our responsibility to hold them in lucid view, so that they can be variously distinguished between the necessary features of our nature as embodied, perspectival agents; and the unnecessary, damaging failures of intersubjectivity that these same predispositions can become." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Societal and technological progress may appear as a gradual process, though, and to an extent it certainly is. But from a longer historical perspective it becomes visible that it is often characterised by sudden change and longer periods of stability or stagnation. In evolutionary biology it is widely recognised that major biological changes do not occur through processes of steady piecemeal increases, but through sudden bursts of rapidly evolving complexity. The same dynamic seems to apply to societal development as well. When new levels of societal complexity emerge, it usually does so in accordance with the aforementioned dynamics of sudden chaotic phase transitions.
>
> ... Although economic growth has been staggering since the early twentieth century, the fundamental qualitative properties of our current society – market economy, parliamentary institutions, rule of law, etc. – are arguably more or less the same. Our society has changed, but it does not differ as much from that of 100 years ago as that of the early twentieth century differs from the late eighteenth century.
>
> Our society has changed dramatically in terms of economic growth, technological progress, population increase and so on during the past 100 years, but the changes that have occurred may only be as different as water at 1° Celsius is from that at 99°. The temperature of water can have significantly different effects on a human body, but the fundamental property of water itself is still the same. It remains a liquid. Similarly, our current society still remains a rationalist, market-liberal democracy. These are its most fundamental properties. Given the many quantitative changes since the early twentieth century such as the ones mentioned above, our society certainly has widely different effects on its inhabitants today. But in itself, it basically behaves in accordance with the same overarching principles and self-organising dynamics as a century ago.

> "Linear ways of thinking that are common today are those such as:

> Even if some of these linear thoughts can be justified in certain situations, none of them can sufficiently address the fundamental issues we are placed before today. Accordingly, this sort of thinking must be complemented with a more holistic non-linear way of thinking that can handle issues like the above more effectively. The critical problem of linear thinking is that the interrelated, systemic and evolutionary properties of reality make our world develop and behave in non-linear and emergent ways and thus cannot be predicted or fully be accounted for through linear reasoning. Attempting to identify linear cause and effect chains rarely leads us to the source of complex societal problems. Measures derived from linear analysis thus tend to be directed in a straight line against the symptom itself, which can sometimes mitigate the problem for a while, but less often manages to provide a sustainable solution. Often a linear approach to a non-linear problem is counterproductive and such an approach and understanding can even be a part of the original problem.
>
> Let us take an example of different levels of complexity thinking in action. Contemporary politics has great difficulties in handling the challenges of multicultural society since politics has not managed to integrate the astonishing diversity of perspectives, identities and norms that prevail in our current society. In other words, there is a lack of complexity in our thinking corresponding to that of our multicultural reality today. In practice, there are currently at least three political ways to tackle the challenges of multiculturalism:
>
> 1. Maintaining one ethnic identity at the cost of other identities (to flatten or reduce diversity). To build walls. Primarily to be found in nationalist movements. This thinking corresponds to the category level.
>
> 2. Relying on the job market to adjust cultural disagreements (more or less disregarding cultural diversity all together). The mainstream conception of most political parties, from the more traditional branches of the Labour and Democratic parties in the UK and US respectively, their social-liberal equivalents elsewhere, to the majority of most moderate conservatives and libertarians. This thinking corresponds to the connection level.
>
> 3. Affirming diversity in all its forms (opining that all cultural communities are equally good, but in spite of this still consider the presence of more different cultures better than fewer). This is typical of the more progressive branches within the Labour and Democratic parties, far-Left parties elsewhere, green parties and feminists. This thinking corresponds to the system level.
>
> However, none of the above manages to fully meet the multicultural society’s challenges: The ethnocentric approach of the nationalists cannot successfully integrate people who refuse to be assimilated into the majority culture, the mainstream economic approach cannot alleviate the cultural misunderstandings and conflicts that nevertheless occur even if people have jobs, and neither can the diversity approach, which even fails to qualify why any kind of diversity is necessarily a good thing.
>
> A method to more effectively manage the greater complexity of multicultural society would instead sincerely attempt to see and fully understand all of the many different perspectives that make up a society, majorities and minorities alike, on their own terms, and in a way that explores their many varying realities while carefully considering the multitude of different interests, frustrations and needs – optimally, without judgement or moralisation, but still recognise that all individuals and cultures have the possibility – and need – to grow and mature. This level of complex thought hence gives rise to entirely new political questions that are seldom conceived of on the lower levels, such as:
>
> • What challenges do those Muslims who have a literal interpretation of their religion encounter when they attempt to live in accordance with their faith and traditions in a secular society?
>
> • How can their lives be made easier in ways that do not conflict with the rest of society?
>
> • Is it a conflict between Christianity and Islam that creates problems, or is it more specifically a conflict between religion and atheism/secularism? Or perhaps even a conflict between the religious and modern thought perspectives that creates problems in the encounter between native modern Westerners and immigrants from the Middle East? Or all three? 
>
> • What competences and types of understanding do Muslims need in order for their needs to be satisfied with the least possible disagreements as a result?
>
> • What adaptations are reasonable to demand from Muslims and majority society respectively?
>
> • How can these adaptations be facilitated?
>
> • And if we see the same issue from the opposing perspective, questions may arise such as: what challenges face the part of the population that is seeing the country they have been part of building radically changed by migrant populations? Is it reasonable to demand that all traditions and norms be adapted to a multicultural reality? How do we best accommodate the wishes and desires of different cultures to make them live peacefully together and develop together?
>
> As you see, these questions are less judgemental or moralising than both the ethnocentric and diversity approach. Neither a single culture nor diversity in of itself are valued higher than the other, and the questions do not suggest that anyone should subordinate themselves or conform to a particular view considered the morally superior one. It is a more pragmatic approach, and it does not close its eyes in anticipation of the problems solving themselves given enough time and economic progress, as the mainstream stance suggests.
>
> Posing these types of questions meets our complex reality at a corresponding level of inquiry so as to cultivate novel approaches that can foster a well-functioning society at today’s societal complexity level. A politics carried out from such a viewpoint has a greater potential to change people’s lives for the better – but also requires considerably deeper knowledge of people’s everyday lives and realities.
>
> This kind of thinking promotes a new level of political questions that take people’s various experienced realities and their mutual relations into greater consideration. No matter how much people deviate in terms of culture and worldview, or psychological development for that matter, all should be able to express themselves freely and without judgement and feel at home in society – it’s simply ethically untenable to ask for less.
>
> When thinking on a higher complexity level we are not limited to a single perspective but can attempt to create space and opportunity for further development to occur within the diversity of the existing (and possibly future) perspectives. As seen above, we can thereby ask questions that are more likely to handle problems that today appear insoluble.
>
> As we have seen, the level of our thinking’s complexity can affect our political prioritisations and solutions. Below I have sketched a few examples of how this can manifest itself on the meta-level, how the different levels can give rise to very different overall approaches to politics:
>
> 1. Politics of interest (the category level): a particular group’s specific interest or worldview is defended. 
>
> 2. Politics of reconciliation (the connection level): various interests are weighed together and integrated pragmatically. 
>
> 3. Politics of ideas (the system level): there is an attempt to establish a particular idea of the human being and society, with measures sought to disseminate ideas and norms considered superior. 
>
> 4. Politics of emergence (the perspective level): particular consideration is taken to how the ideas, norms and identities that govern society come into being, with this emergence made the kernel of politics.
>
> We can, however, also add a level that lies above the perspective level, one I have chosen to call the complexity level:
>
> 5. Complexity politics: Deliberate measures to create prerequisites for a multitude of emergences of apprehensions of reality; the development and mutual relationship of these are made the kernel of politics.
>
> Political questions can be posed from every complexity level. Now, as an example, in the area of gender and racial equality:
>
> 1. The category level: how can the interests of women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals be defended? 
>
> 2. The connection level: how can the interests of women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals be reconciled vis-à-vis those of men, whites and heterosexuals? 
>
> 3. The system level: how can multicultural and feminist values come to permeate society? 
>
> 4. The perspective level: how can well-functioning values of gender and racial equality and acceptance of alternative life-ways emerge spontaneously in various societal groups? 
>
> 5. The complexity level: how can better prerequisites be created for healthy and mutual beneficial relationships between genders and ethnicities, positive gender, cultural and sexual identities, and feelings of security, self-confidence and freedom in everybody’s life?
>
> The first three questions are characterised by linear thinking (to various extents). It is the first three questions that historically have dominated politics of gender and racial equality. Initially, from the beginning of the twentieth century and onwards, women’s and men’s interests were pitted against each other. This has in our time evolved towards the third issue, where discrimination has been regarded as an unfortunate part of society that can be replaced with superior values of equality. The less complex questions are potentially more oppressive than the more complex ones. Note how the last two questions do not create as much antagonism. They take a stand for everyone, regardless of where they are in society. The fourth question handles spontaneous emergence of various experiences from which the first three questions become meaningful. The last question handles the greatest complexity since it looks to the prerequisites for the diversity of emergence and how these can be developed in interaction with each other.
>
> Almost all current political organisations start from one of the three lower complexity levels. The result is that major parts of the population are forced to comply and subordinate themselves to a certain amount of compulsory adaptation. It hardly needs to be explained how this poses certain problems: forcing people to comply to new norms obviously fosters resistance since people generally do not like being told what to do and think, which in the end makes the politics in question more likely to fail.
>
> As such, it is time for politics to build on the two higher complexity levels. This requires changes in our political culture, in the political system, and in society at large. We thus need to ask new political questions such as:
>
> • How are the many diverse perspectives and ideas that determine people’s actions created?
>
> • And how can we coordinate and further develop these perspectives in ways that are not perceived as oppressive?
>
> • What do different kinds of people really need to feel that their lives are meaningful and full of joy?
>
> • How are the desires and needs that shape economic life created?
>
> • And how can we reshape them in ways that are more socially and environmentally sustainable?
>
> • How can people’s sense of self-worth be developed and how does this development influence the political debate in society as a whole?
>
> • And how can we further the psychological and emotional development of the average citizen to a degree that makes them more competent at managing and relating to our increasingly complex world?
>
> These questions may seem rather obvious when put in a list like this, nothing controversial really, but they do remain out of the ordinary in our common political discourse today. This is very unfortunate, because we need to ask questions like these if we are to solve the current crises. We need to develop our way of doing politics, and our way of thinking.
>
> This is the great challenge of our age, and something demanding the utmost of our cognitive capacities. If we want to change the way we think about society and politics today, it will require that we are willing to make sacrifices, personal and societal, and that we put great efforts into the difficult task of coordinating a multitude of perspectives alien to ourselves, developing the necessary complexity and perspectival awareness to do so. However, it has been done before. Humanity has, as we have seen in this book, always managed to eventually advance to a higher and more complex thought perspective." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Modernism sees human nature as fixed, whereas postmodernism sees the human being as a social construction. Could the next step be to see the human being as a social, psychological, biological and technological development process? Modernism has always seen the human as an individual that creates itself, postmodernism that relations create the individual, that we as persons are created by structures beyond our reach. A new view of the person to include both of these insights could be that of the ‘dividual’, i.e. seeing the individual as somewhat ‘divisible’ in that it can always absorb new ideas and properties in interaction with the environment, but still remains relatively autonomous in this process. This would free us from having to choose between an internal or external perspective and give us the possibility to retain a more nuanced view, a ‘transpersonal perspective’, i.e. that the individual is created by the collective while the collective at the same time is created by a number of individuals. The task thus becomes how to investigate and account for this reciprocal creation process, a process of a highly developmental nature.
>
> Modern society relies on a meritocratic social order, a society where the thrift and ingenuity of the individual should be rewarded and those with the best qualifications should be given the responsibility to govern. Postmodernists have challenged this view by showing that it has led to inequality and marginalisation, with minority voices being excluded. Instead, postmodernism advocates a multicultural order where the weak are included. But do we need to choose between majority and minorities? Could we not instead look to the prerequisites for a multitude of diverse psychological and cultural forms and developmental levels to be working in concert? What is the best alternative to modernism’s hierarchies and postmodernism’s anarchy, a synthesis that is not just an in-the-middle compromise? The notion of ‘holarchy’,9 that is, the ambition to create justice and democratically based hierarchies that are not arbitrary, could be a solution to this dilemma that we could expect to see as an integral part of the next thought perspective. Most importantly, perhaps, the next thought perspective would start to ask how modern, postmodern and traditional pre-modern people can live together peacefully, how we can bridge the growing gulf between people adhering to and thinking in accordance with different thought perspectives, and how we can make them cooperate productively towards the goal of a better future for our children." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "We no longer want to abolish all hierarchies, but rather to make sure that the best and most sustainable modes of thinking are rewarded. The postmodern stance that any perspective is as valuable as any other is simply not tenable in the long turn. We need to make a choice. It is not always both/and, sometimes it is actually either/or – and we must risk that we can be wrong." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "The greater our capacity to see and understand the evolutionary context of our lives and our society, the longer the stretches of time we can comprehend, and the better we understand the overarching principles and mechanisms fostering change." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Now, the context that most urgently needs our attention as we once again approach a new level of complexity is arguably that of change over time itself: the developmental context that most of us still remain snugly embedded within. Instead of just being in the time – instead of time being a subject that we merely exist within while developmental change just happens – we should attempt to increase our contextual awareness of time so that we can treat evolution as an object for reflection and thereby take responsibility for where we want it to go, as our civilisational becoming." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Here I would like to exemplify how the metamodern thought perspective can bridge the tension between different thought perspectives. The notion of individuation-integration is crucial if we want to understand societal development from this new perspective.
>
> Individuals develop in many ways: psycho-motorically, aesthetically, morally, emotionally, sexually, intellectually and so on. One of the most important ways of developing humans’ individuality is, as we have discussed, through the human being’s sense of ‘I’ traveling through various stages of perception about itself and its place in the world. The individual finds itself again and again in ever wider layers in an ever greater and deeper I: in infancy, from identifying with all sensory perceptions to identifying oneself with the body and its needs; in adolescence, to identifying with the inner voice of one’s thoughts; in adult life, to identifying oneself with the roles that the thought creates; to identifying with the processes that create these roles; in very few highly developed persons, to identifying with the consciousness behind these processes; to identifying with the consciousness that is in us all; to identifying with existence itself and becoming – and maybe further in ways that are not known yet. At every stage the individual becomes more unique, finds deeper ways to express its eccentricities and individuality. This process of developing the self towards deeper identification and stronger individuality is called ‘individuation’.
>
> At every stage of psychological development, the human being needs greater depth. We need to find deeper ways to express ourselves, to share our joy and sorrows, to share our gifts. To develop healthily we need to be properly integrated at the new level. The more individual and specialised we become, the greater the gift we have to bestow on our fellow humans and other living beings, and the deeper the loneliness and alienation we experience if we do not find a context in which our individuality can be expressed. The longer the individuation process progresses, the more complex and deep are the contexts needed in order for our individuality to be allowed to flower. The alienation that many people experience today in work and personal life can to a significant extent be seen as an expression of their individuality being deepened beyond the roles and work tasks that society offers. Our free-spirited, liberal society has yielded many unique seekers with very special insights, properties and gifts, yet most often we do not succeed in creating social contexts where people really get the chance to live out their highest potential. When people become trapped in bureaucratic systems and social contexts where they are expected to act, think and work from all too limited modes of thinking, they may abandon their yearning to live out their full potential. Personal growth can then soon be followed by a dull and meaningless existence if the level of psychological development is not accompanied by a corresponding degree of development in one’s surroundings.
>
> A person may long to express their love for the world through a job that uses their deepest insights about life – but instead life comes to revolve around meeting deadlines they have no personal interest in fulfilling other than to pay the mortgage on their house. And so life crawls on. It becomes colourless, meaningless, desolate. It may be hard to see how common this alienation really is. It arises as soon as we are (or feel as though we are) the only person who sees something, large or small, and no one understands us or wants to listen. Or when we quite simply do not fit in, do not feel at home in our everyday environment – at school, at work, or in society at large – or when we experience distance from our loved ones and do not quite know why. Occasionally we even notice deep alienation towards reality in its entirety. We wonder what our place is in it. But we are not alone in feeling this way – most people today experience this at some point in their lives. In this there is great possibility for change. There need to be contexts created that allow for personal development throughout life, but this must also be complemented with suitable arenas for people’s newly acquired insights and skills to come to good use. If we develop ourselves, if we become wiser and more empathic, but there is nowhere for us to use our newly won wisdom and compassion, we are more likely to become depressed, alienated and frustrated with life. When we develop as individuals, we need to be integrated anew in a context that corresponds with the level of our new individuality.
>
> While individuation without integration creates shattered dreams, betrayed expectations and a desperate sense of loneliness, integration without corresponding individuation creates oppression. If we are squeezed into a context without personal inner development (or spontaneous sense of self and reality) corresponding with the context that we are expected to take part in, we become oppressed. Children that are expected to sit and concentrate from the age of six for a large part of the day, when this actually requires the mind of an adult, are exposed to oppression of sorts. People who do not experience compassion for each other, but are forced to help each other through feelings of guilt and shame, are oppressed. People who feel compelled to adopt values in order to avoid exclusion are oppressed. People who do not love their partner and hold back their real needs because of social pressure are oppressed. All contexts where people are squeezed into a structure against their will constitute integration without corresponding individuation and are expressions of various forms of oppression. This oppression is always a violation of some kind, sometimes crude and apparent, other times subtle and hard to pinpoint.
>
> Let us look, in a somewhat simplified way, at how these two sides are connected with today’s political landscape. The political Left often talks, thinks and acts from an awareness of this kind of alienation and seeks to alleviate it by integrating the individual in a deeper context. However, they often fail to see the risks that might accompany an increased integration. Neither does the Left emphasise that individuation must be supported by political means, such as schooling and lifelong cultivation and development. Communism is a particularly unfortunate example of this one-sidedness. Citizens were forced to be in solidarity with each other and share everything equally. But without a corresponding degree of psychological development to ensure these feelings and inclinations would emerge spontaneously in their psyches, the system proved highly unsustainable.
>
> Libertarians tend to defend the individual against the potential oppression that increased integration can result in, often emphasising freedom of choice. However, they are to a much lesser degree conscious of the tragedy of alienation and tend to advocate a flatter, more superficial society where people’s aspirations and relations are reduced to individual interests and transactions of various kinds. Neoliberal thinkers believe that these transactions are sufficient in order to organise society’s most important functions, but the wicked social problems in modern societies suggest that this is highly inadequate.
>
> Social conservatism and nationalism, on the other hand, react against alienation and want to reintegrate the individual in old, crumbling communities, but do not see the need for integration at new, higher-complexity levels. They simply insist on reintegrating everyone into old national or religious communities while they ignore that not everyone identifies with these and that they would feel oppressed if they were integrated into them. A new kind of imagined community to replace the nation-state or a given religion rarely occurs to conservatives. Conservatism of various kinds follows political lines that leave certain people alienated and lonely (those who do not have the possibility of expressing themselves in society) and others oppressed (those who are integrated against their experienced will).
>
> Ecologists and greens often want to reintegrate the human being in a broader context: nature’s. Here, too, however, there is a lack of sensitivity for people being at various stages of individuation and that their experienced need of identification varies substantially. If people do not feel any belongingness with nature, or do not feel they are part of the great ecosystems of the natural world, or simply do not care about environmental sustainability, forcing upon them a societal model that emphasises sustainability and limits their consumption level will be experienced as deeply oppressive.

> The complete picture of individuation and integration must be taken into consideration and translated into politics. Everyone, as far as it is possible, should have the right to feel part of a community that corresponds with their level of individuality, i.e. social contexts that resonate with the values and emotional needs of communion of different individuals. When people feel they are members of a community that neither oppresses nor alienates them they will not only be happier but also bring greater and more relevant benefits to others.
>
> Instead of, as religion, seeing meaning creation as God-given or the like, we can see the human being’s creation of meaning and of a world of symbols as an invariably impossible and half-finished construction – a protosynthesis, to use a word from the list I introduced above. Whatever we do, some people will feel alienated or oppressed – but this can occur to very varying extents. Pluralistic democratic societies tend to provide better opportunities for more people to liberate themselves from suffocating social contexts and to find meaningful communion with like-minded people than totalitarian and conservative religious societies. However, if we increase our understanding of individuation and integration and make it part of our political thinking, the degree of alienation and oppression could most likely be even further decreased. What is needed is an active, conscious societal effort to create better prerequisites for people’s lives to be meaningful – an effort supported by scientifically acquired knowledge and postmodern sensitivity, since every new context requires new forms of thinking and feeling.
>
> The metamodern thought perspective recognises that the human being and its society are created in constant interaction with each other and that there is a developmental direction in this process. This development runs towards a higher complexity, which also places greater demands on people to think, feel and cooperate in order for society to function and for people to thrive. The metamodern thought perspective coordinates various approaches towards the human being’s inner depth (from religion) with their behaviour and organism (from science) and its culturally fixed situation (from postmodernism). The result is a new image of the human being, society and reality.
>
> Thinking in this both/and fashion opens up a new analysis of the individual human being and its development, driving us to think ‘trans-personally’, which can help us solve the problems that are currently out of our reach. This I will try to explain in the last section of this chapter.
>
> Transpersonal Development
>
> The individual is created by the collective, and the collective is ultimately just a collection of individuals. It is not meaningful to choose a side in the debate on whether the interests of the individual are to be put first or whether the community and solidarity should be our highest priority. A common solution to this problem has recently been to emphasise the network, where relationships between people and how these relationships affect each other are considered to accommodate both the individual and the collective. The problem with the network approach, however, is that it reduces the importance of the individual’s own inner experience and that it does not succeed in capturing the collective realities in a sufficiently clear way. The advocates of the network approach sometimes use the metaphor of an organism to describe society. But the organism is not a good way to understand society because an organism has an individual consciousness of some kind that a society does not. The organism itself is also more important than all its individual cells or body parts. Instead, society exists for all its members, not the other way around.
>
> Hence society cannot be reduced to its individuals. Society cannot be reduced to its collective structures. Society is not a network. Society is not an organism. What is society, then? It is all of these and none of them. Society is a wide variety of, often very different, experienced realities – which are inextricably linked to each other. Society is a transpersonal whole of partly interrelated, partly independent parts. The deeper the level from which society is analysed, the clearer its transpersonal nature appears. Take social problems in a family for instance:
>
> The children are unruly and unfocused in school. The children are unruly because Mom and Dad are fighting and do not pay them full loving attention. The reason that Mom and Dad are fighting is that they experience a lot of anger and disappointment. The reason they experience a lot of anger and disappointment is that they feel their lives have not become what they wish and that they lack control to change their situations. The reason they experience this is that they have been counteracted in their lives and never managed to build up good self-esteem and positive relations to life. Their actions are shaped by emotions and thoughts about which they are not aware. The thoughts and feelings come to a large extent from the relations they experience in the social order in general. The social order in general is due to the fact that many other people feel the same as them. Those who represent the social order make their decisions in accordance with how society already works. They do not put enough effort into improving children’s opportunities because they do not know how. The children are unruly.
>
> And so on. It is not possible to judge whether the individuals or the collective structures or the network of relationships are responsible. These are just different sides of the same reality. The ‘social problems’ in a family are just a surface, a way among many to describe a part of human suffering in reality. The deeper into the experiences of the problem we go, and the more we see the interaction of these experiences with other parts of reality, the closer we will be to effectively addressing the problem.
>
> What is the core of the complex problem above? Is it the individual’s own responsibility, or maybe its own experience? Is it the collective structures? Is it the network of relations? Or is it the ‘organism’ of society as a whole? The problem has no core, no simple cause. There is no single person to blame, no collective structure that explains everyone’s inner experiences, no single imbalance in the network, no disease in the community body. There are different consciousnesses partly separated from one another and at the same time inextricably linked. By understanding their experiences and how these experiences are created and influence each other, we can begin to see the overall picture. For example:
>
> The children are unruly. The children are unruly because Mom and Dad are fighting and do not pay them full loving attention. Mom and Dad work together to face their anger and disappointment, noticing when these feelings appear. The reason they work with their feelings is that they feel they can increase control over their lives and alleviate what caused them pain and anxiety. Their actions are shaped by the thoughts and feelings they gradually become more aware of. The ability to discover and relate to their thoughts and feelings is a result of methods to do so being common knowledge in society. This change in society is due to the fact that many people experienced similar concerns and that good knowledge about managing one’s emotions eventually became widely available. Those who represent the social order are interested in and support these changes. Political measures have therefore been made to ensure that children get increased emotional support in preschool. The children’s unruliness soon changes in favour of creativity and a desire to learn.
>
> What looked like a Gordian knot from the other perspectives can, when a transpersonal perspective was applied, thus be resolved. By going deep into the personal experiences and perspectives of each of the involved parties we could handle greater complexity because we made it a problem neither of the individual nor of the collective. The problem could then be solved without identifying the exact solution to the first mentioned problem. This is because the ‘problem’, i.e. that the children are unruly, was only a surface phenomenon, an expression of a deeper, transpersonal social reality that was located deep inside the consciousness of many different people and in the way these consciousnesses affected each other.
>
> The above was just one out of many ways a transpersonal perspective can handle greater psychological depth and societal complexity, and thinking transpersonally is just one out of many new modes of thought we can expect to see from the metamodern thought perspective. It shows the effectiveness of thinking both/and and either/or (and sometimes even neither/nor), of including both objective, subjective and intersubjective aspects (W1, W2 and W3), developmental psychology and non-linear thinking. I hope to have demonstrated that it is perhaps even a way of breaching the gridlock of our current postmodern obsession with the antithesis. If more people develop this way of thinking and learn how to competently master some of these new symbol tools, rather than settling for the antithesis, there might be more who feel confident enough to make proposals to really change society." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "There has never been so much unnecessary suffering in the world as today. By ‘unnecessary’ I mean things that we currently actually have the material means and knowledge to do something about – but that still are not addressed successfully. Much of the suffering that existed two hundred years ago was caused by insufficient knowledge and a lack of resources. In comparison to today, food was scarce, industrial production inefficient, many diseases were not treatable, and populations were growing faster than productivity. As such, it was impossible to ensure an acceptable living standard for all. But today we actually have the technological possibilities and material resources to adequately satisfy the basic material needs of every human on Earth.
>
> Hence it is not because of insufficient efficiency that this has not already been achieved, but rather a lack of fairness. The reason that we are so far from doing this, I believe, is because of an additional deficiency relating to the third aspect of this trio (presented in chapter 9): purpose and meaning.
>
> The lack of purpose and meaning in many peoples’ lives is responsible for a fair share of our currently unresolved societal problems. Our market society has left many of us in a postmodern ‘value vacuum’ that makes life feel empty and devoid of substantial meaning-creating structures to fuel deep-felt motivation. In turn, our further personal growth is inhibited, which makes it less likely that we reach the level of consciousness in our society and culture required so that the project of creating a fairer and more sustainable society becomes meaningful to more of us. To alleviate this ill, we need to develop our culture and our collective imaginary. We need to cultivate a more conscious society. In this chapter, we examine what this means in theory and practice.
>
> But can we, our society and our culture become more conscious than today? Can we, as a collective, become more complexly thinking, more empathetic and wiser than we currently are? Or, to approach the issue from the reverse direction: is it reasonable to assume that we and our society have reached the highest stage of consciousness possible? As humanity has progressed for millennia, from animism, through the religions of the Axial Age, to the Enlightenment and the modern industrial state, have we now arrived at the last stage of societal development? Are the democratic market society, the postmodern critique and science working silently in the background, ensuring economic growth and a new gadget to amuse us every now and then the pinnacle of human evolution? Have we reached ‘the end of history’?
>
> I do not believe we have reached the end, that all we can expect is more of the same, a couple of new technologies here, a little economic growth there. I believe it is possible – and urgently necessary – to create an entirely different and vastly better society where we take human wellbeing to a level that is considered utopian today. For that to happen we cannot only rely on the market to do the job for us. Neither is it a matter of merely piecemeal adjustments to our existing institutions and legislation. If we wish to make society better adapted to the increasing complexity of the world, it is paramount that we start thinking about our cultural evolution, that we ask ourselves how we can collectively reach a higher level of consciousness.
>
> A culture with its collective imaginary is not an immutable entity with a fixed essence. If we look at history from a long-term perspective, we see that cultures can develop and over time advance to handle higher levels of complexity, that they can expand their circle of belonging to include more individuals, and that they can come to wiser and more sensitive decisions that take new aspects into consideration that previously were not accounted for. In short, that human culture has become more conscious. Despite the questionable behaviour of many modern governments, we must admit they generally behave more consciously than the Vikings or Genghis Khan. We usually think twice before we let our instinct-driven inclinations for aggression and immediate self-gratification guide our political decisions, we are less inclined to accept superstition and unfounded personal opinions regarding societal matters, and overall our societies adhere to and function in accordance with fairer, more inclusive, values than before.
>
> Now the question that needs to be posed to the world’s rapidly ageing populations is: As we as individuals have a lifelong capacity to evolve in our ability to perceive and handle complexity, what would a positive, nourishing social environment look like – one that supports transformative learning and the emergence of higher mental complexity, and perhaps even inner wisdom? Contemporary developmental psychology has handed us a few clues: social security, sufficiently large challenges, ample support in learning, a high degree of acceptance of failure, a healthy diet, a lot of exercise and physical contact, practice in social and emotional intelligence, existential conversations, meditation, gaining access to more social arenas in which to move in parallel – but here we are starting to digress beyond the purpose of this book. Let us merely sum up by saying that we have many clues today, but that we are at the start of this voyage of knowledge and that skilful researchers and others must unveil the unifying pattern and put it in the service of human development.
>
> However, what we all can do is to start asking the right questions: How can people be supported in their inner and cognitive development? And why in the world is this not already a highly prioritised political and social objective?
>
> But what indeed does a ‘more conscious society’ mean? The answer lies on at least three levels, closely related to each other: development on the personal level and the collective level, and the latter can be divided into cultural and structural development. Let us look closer at these three, one by one.
>
> More Conscious Individuals
>
> As individuals, we can be more or less embedded in, and more or less detached from, our understanding of ourselves and of our environment. We might in other words have ‘props ’ in our inner landscapes that are more or less taken for granted – assumptions, perspectives and perceptions that we cannot bring ourselves to question, that simply exist and that shape our comprehension of whom we are and how our world works.
>
> Inner Disembedding – we become more and more transparent to ourselves
>
> ...
>
> Here I once again want to return to Robert Kegan’s model of the evolution of consciousness: the subject becomes an object and a new subject is born. This can occur in many different ways. We may for instance habitually assume that we ‘are’ our thoughts. One day we may discover that the thoughts occasionally fall silent for long periods and that the inner monologue appears to take place rather compulsively and most often beyond our ‘own volition’. Suddenly we understand that we ‘are’ not the inner stream of thoughts. We thereby also understand that there ought to be a more general, underlying, in some sense greater ‘self’ than we have previously realised – otherwise my ‘self’ could of course not hear the thoughts and direct them and every so often lose control over them. This ‘self’ can then suddenly take responsibility for reshuffling the stream of thoughts. Maybe we will notice that the stream of thoughts often has a short-term character and does not shy away from denial, repression and self-delusion. In a sense our degree of freedom has increased. The self has awakened to some degree – matured, grown.
>
> ...
>
> Outer ‘disembedding’ – our collective imaginary becomes more and more transperent
>
> ...
>
> God becomes a theological object, and then ‘religion’ becomes an object of the science of religion, rather than ultimate reality. Thereafter science becomes an object of the sociology of knowledge: one describes how discourses and paradigms emerge in particular communities, bound by social norms, methodological inventions and also power struggles. Thereafter postmodernism becomes an object: a thought perspective amid others, a developmental step that follows the same basic dynamics as the earlier ones. And this is, of course, a little ironic, since postmodernism generally does not believe in historical stories of developmental steps.
>
> What I am getting at here is that we as individuals in varying degree can detach ourselves from these thought structures, thereby becoming more conscious of them. Actually, they all coexist in today’s ‘modern’ society: some of us go to fortune tellers and invoke spirits, some believe that Jesus is our sole saviour and that an almighty God with a capital G has had everything we need to know written down in a book, some believe that we live in Newton’s Universe which ultimately is a kind of machine, some believe that we live in various arbitrary cultural constructions, and then there are those – myself included – who believe that we live in the Universe’s (or rather reality’s) kaleidoscopic development of perspectives of itself. All these diverse people walk the same streets, eat at the same tables, give each other Christmas presents and talk with all and sundry. But what a mixture; what a blessed hotchpotch!
>
> Here we see that inner and outer ‘disembedding’ can – and do – interact and support each other, creating ever-increasing inner and outer ‘transparency’. We can develop to more clearly see through what initially appears to us as an opaque self and an opaque society.
>
> But this development is not without problems. How good are we at reflecting on our own perspective, and discussing those of others? When should we just respect the perspectives of others and when do we have a moral obligation to try to broaden others’ perspective? It is for instance not enough either to invoke spirits or to pray to God to solve the climate crisis. Nor is it sufficient – which may be more surprising – to only study the climate crisis as a meteorological and atmospheric-chemical phenomenon. And it is not even sufficient to deconstruct and criticise the discourses, power relations and uses of language that stand in the way of our ability to address the climate crisis. One must instead, in accordance with the metamodern thought perspective, consider how one communicates with developmental levels and all the other thought perspectives, and coordinate this multifaceted communication with both scientific, developmental psychological and sociological understanding of how one can create realistic solutions.
>
> But all this requires an inner, emotional and existential maturity, and an ability to take others’ perspectives. For the question is after all not merely how we can broaden our thought perspectives. The even more crucial question is how well we can empathise with, and understand, others.
>
> Some ‘wise’ people, for example in animist cultures, may have evolved considerably in their inner ‘disembedding’, and less so in the outer ditto. Young intellectuals in today’s society might have the opposite profile. For a more complete profile of the more conscious individual, both these sides – and their mutual interplay – should be viewed as decisive.
>
> More Conscious Cultures
>
> As for cultural development, this can be studied both at meso- (between) and macrolevel. The mesolevel within sociology usually pertains to such structures that exist both at organisation and institution levels. This is for understandable reasons an area into which I have delved extensively, as I have been part of launching and running several companies and organisations. In recent years, academic sociology has also to a greater extent begun to emphasise the importance of the mesolevel for society. When we seek answers as to why a certain country has certain social or economic characteristics, it is often the institutions and their mechanisms that offer the firmest explanations. Previously, one tended to search for explanations of a historical kind, about modern society as a whole, about cultures and national characters. But it is often the way the organisations are constructed that provides the clearest image of what happens in society.
>
> There is of course a rich and growing literature, primarily within the ‘softer’ parts of business administration, emphasising that organisations do have not only formal structures, but also cultures of their own, for better or worse. This insight has over the last few decades often assumed slightly ridiculous expressions when corporate managements have produced values and value-systems for their companies. These are naturally more often experienced as awkward and seldom as identity-creating. One most often tends to forget them.
>
> But is it possible to do something to create a ‘higher consciousness’ that permeates the organisation? ... Robert Kegan calls such an organisation a DDO: Deliberately Developmental Organisation.
>
> It is, of course, easier to influence culture at an organisational level than at a societal level, a smaller culture rather than a larger one. It may even be simpler to recreate an organisation than to influence a single individual’s developmental psychology. But of course, even the overarching societal culture and the crucial societal institutions can evolve – which has occurred through history. The Nordic countries’ culture can today probably in several respects be seen as ‘more conscious’ than that of many other countries in the sense that our cultures encourage us to become more aware about, e.g. climate and gender equality issues. Perspectives that many other cultures simply do not see.
>
> ...
>
> Might a greater proportion of more conscious individual ‘selves’ start to collaborate with each other to propel new changes in societal culture? Can the norms actively and consciously be repudiated – for instance so that the political debate would give more space to agreement, openness for admitting mistakes and more respect for fact-checking and nuanced discussion? Surely, this would be of benefit to society’s collective intelligence? Or would one be able to repudiate the norms so that inner development and meditation become more generally accepted – but by no means end up in the hands of the poorly thought-through New Age movements? Would one be able to make manipulation through sexist advertising and sweets at the check-out counter less accepted, so that people are less ashamed of their bodies and develop fewer self-harming behaviours and neuroses? Or just so that one generally becomes more cosmopolitan-minded and oriented towards sustainability and resilience? ... Would it be easier to handle our current complexity if we had stronger roots and developed deeper relations?
>
> In order for a symbolic language, a culture, to be reproduced, a sufficiently large number of individuals must be located at the symbolic system’s complexity level. Most can be located under this complexity level if the system should factor this in and develop ‘scaffolding’ (language, metaphors, schools, libraries, public service) that helps them function in society. But a significant ‘culture-bearing’ minority must personally be able to work and re-create at the culture’s complexity level.
>
> Thus, we must protect our symbolic world in the same way that we protect other common utilities, such as the environment. That is, we must focus on upgrading our cultural code!
>
> As we saw in chapter 9, culture carries our common subjectivity – but it is also the role of culture to contribute to us being able to develop our individual subjectivity. Culture cannot develop your subjectivity for you. You have to do it yourself through your life experiences and use culture’s symbolic tools for reflection and processing. But culture’s symbolic world can provide tools, help and support. However, a less developed culture can of course hold us back.
>
> In order for our society to grow socially, more individuals must reach a higher cognitive and empathic level. In order for this to occur, the individuals must be aided in their growth by culture. Thus culture and our common symbolic language must lead the societal development through cultivating the individuals’ ability to understand and interpret our world. We could, inspired by Kegan’s DDO, call such a societal culture a DDC: a Deliberately Developmental Culture.
>
> Culture must thus in its supportive and developing role, lead the individuals and thereby also the market. We cannot expect that the developing culture will arrive as demand on the market. The religions understood this, and thus this is an important insight that we must try to integrate in our new thought perspective. Today this way of viewing societal culture is not particularly common.
>
> Culture as a collective good
>
> As previously mentioned, economists make a distinction between private and collective goods. Private goods are those that only can be consumed by the owner or very few people. If your friend eats your birthday cake, you will be without cake. The cake is a private good. Therefore it can also be bought and sold. If you have the money, you can buy a new cake, but then you must earn the same money by giving up some other private utility or working (i.e. sell your services).
>
> But that your friend is running in the park, breathing the air, does not prevent you from doing the same. It may even be more fun to go jogging in the park if your friend is also doing so. We are now talking about collective goods such as parks, air and knowledge. Today a major discussion has flared up around these and in particular around ‘commons’ (woodlands and other things that people historically have shared, but also inventions and knowledge that are in the public domain), things that theorists and experimental business entrepreneurs imagine can guide us towards a fairer ‘post-capitalist’ society.
>
> One way of approaching societal culture is precisely as such a collective good. Sometimes people wonder what education within the humanities really is good for. Why do we, with our hard-earned tax money, educate scarcely productive literary theorists and sundry professionals in culture snobbery? One answer may be sought precisely in how culture is developed as a collective good.
>
> But it is, of course, not only the theatre, the opera and the snobby literary theorist who constitute ‘culture’. Culture is, as has been noted earlier, the entire weave that our everyday lives, our habits, our language and common horizon of comprehension consists of – our symbolic world...
>
> ... Can our language be more clever, deeper and help us discover more nuances or perspectives? Can we become better at more accurately relating to the new, unwieldy phenomena that globalisation places before us? And – again – as a collective good, the market will never be able alone to provide the societal culture we all need to flourish.
>
> More Conscious Societal Structures
>
> Let us look a little closer at more conscious societal structures. How can we create societal structures that support both personal and cultural development? How do we, for example, consciously create constitutive rules of the market so that the market supports the flourishing of individuals, societies and the planet?
>
> Today we have through science accepted that there is a need for experts within virtually everything pertaining to the material world. No politician or corporate leader would ever get the idea of themselves constructing the new bridge or a new aircraft. When it comes to the technological symbolic world, we put our trust in experts. As for the cultural symbolic world, we are today expected to construct our meaning-making and self-evolving symbolic world ourselves. A little bit like trying to build our own bridge with tree branches.
>
> But changing laws and rules is easier said than done. Here we encounter the trickier problem that legislation around such things as the market’s constitutive rules necessarily requires that all of us in society in some way must reach an agreement. This is not so easy if most are not even ‘aware’ of the issues.
>
> ...
>
> But if the institutions are designed to better satisfy human needs and invite us to later stages of psychological development, more of us can live in deeper freedom. Such freedom does for most of us entail an endeavour to realise a unique individuality, but this invariably seems to result in a quest for the universal, for greater and more widely applicable values.
>
> We may thus glimpse a chicken-or-egg causality dilemma: How can we create a conscious society without conscious individuals that can and want to create such a society, and how do we get conscious individuals without a society that supports us in a sensitive way? But it is also possible to view the issue in a different light: as a self-reinforcing historical development cycle. Individuals, culture and institutions reinforce each other bit by bit – even if the path is far from straight and unambiguous. It is of course true that the institutions are the hardiest, the most difficult to change. But once they do change, it usually happens with tremendous force. Just think of the effect modern trade law has had, or compulsory education.
>
> When we talk of development of more conscious societal institutions, we should thus keep at least two thoughts in mind at once. One of them revolves around a dawning collective consciousness and resolve – or collective freedom to act – which thus is the general insight that society has the possibility and capacity to reshape itself. It can be transformed – from kingdom to democracy, from a capitalist to a post-capitalist society, from a parliamentary/representative society to a more profoundly democratic one. The other side of the coin is that the societal institutions constitute, or at least might constitute, collective support structures for the development of individuals, culture and subcultures (and their mutual interaction).
>
> An important part of our individual consciousness is, as we have seen, our ability to take various aspects of our existence as objects of our will. When we succeed in attaining something as an object of our conscious will, our freedom to act increases; we can say that our consciousness has increased in scope.
>
> In the same way we can view our society’s ability to include various objects under its political will through political decision processes. Changing society’s constitutive rules, for instance, does not fall upon our individual will. We can as individuals be fully aware of what needs to be done, but if we as a society in our collective decision processes do not have the ability to ‘see’ a problem, then nor do we have the ability to collectively act upon the problem. We would then have surrendered part of our common human freedom.
>
> In such a case, as a society, we would be less conscious than we would have been if we had had the collective ability to see and act. But the increased consciousness in this sense does not necessarily mean that we make the ‘right’ decision. I am merely saying that we have the ability to make a decision on an issue. That we do not, because of our inability to exercise political will as a society, become ‘force-fed’ a ‘decision’ through failing to make a decision...
>
> What happens in an ecosystem when we increase its ability towards more complex self-organisation? When I am saying that we together must develop ‘a more conscious society’ I am thus referring to the combination of all three developments above, that is:
>
> • more conscious individuals 
>
> • more conscious organisational and societal cultures 
>
> • more conscious structures in society 
>
> We must work at all these levels in the ecosystem simultaneously, and naturally the developments at the various levels support each other in continuously ongoing parallel processes of self-eco-organisation (see chapter 10).
>
> With more complex self-organising individual consciousnesses, the organisational culture and society are better able to self-organise in a complex way. More complex systems give us more freedom, as we have seen, but also more responsibility to handle this freedom. With a more complex culture and society, individual consciousnesses are aided in developing complexity: deeper and more nuanced approaches within the world. And so forth in an upward spiral. But the spiral can also go in the opposite direction. The crucial insight is that the choice is ours and that a conscious common effort is required to attain the upward spiral.
>
> Who Would Not Want to See a More Conscious Society?
>
> This may sound like a rhetorical question, but it may be worth remembering that there unfortunately may be interests that have no wish whatsoever to see a more conscious society. Maybe they would even prefer a less conscious society. What interests would want us all to live our lives rather unconsciously and without reflection, merely following our programmed patterns? In whose interest would it be that most of us predominantly are passive and non-thinking?
>
> The first group that comes to mind is advertisers, marketers and the giant corporations that today dominate the world market. For them it is of course better if we continue to react to the impulses that their marketing is designed to awaken in us, without reflecting on it at all. That we continue to satisfy our emotional needs through consumption.
>
> Another group might be our present politicians. They have no real interest in us gaining a more trenchant insight into the need for a system shift. Such an awakening would probably only lead to us voters seeing through their incompetence and their dependency on special interests, causing them to lose power.
>
> Yet another group is, of course, many of the established religions whose power is based on our not being able to see that they have ceased to fill their original function – to help us and society evolve – and instead have become backward-striving power machines.
>
> A final group might be established academics who have their entire careers invested in one or other of the old thought perspectives...
>
> ...
>
> Our consciousness is largely a social process stretching far beyond the brain. Our minds are intimately connected with each other through our shared symbol world, and the uniquely human symbolic language is to a considerable extent what enables our further psychological development. Thanks to our symbolic language we have been able to attain a reflective self-consciousness. Our language and culture are therefore intimately related, and the development of one of these is not possible without equivalent development of the other.
>
> The streams of thoughts that constantly flow through our minds consist of words (and their contextual meanings) we have acquired from our social world. The words we use to describe the world in turn influence how we perceive and think about it, and the meaning we create from these is largely derived from the cultural context we have acquired them from. Accordingly, the modern idea of ‘the individual’ that shapes most people’s idea of who we are is highly inadequate. Our thinking and agency are not entirely autonomous, but to a considerable extent dependent on the cultural context that has given us our language, the level of development of which in turn sets the limit for how far we can develop our individual consciousness. The idea of the transpersonal dividual, as described in the previous chapter, is thus a better term to describe who or what we really are. Psychology, culture and language are thus part of the same developmental process, and they all shape our societal structures and collective imaginary. Our personal evolution and development is thus closely interlinked with our collective evolution and development and vice versa. This is not something I have been the first to realise.
>
> The psychologist Lev Vygotskij, whose now classic theories on cultural development and developmental psychology became known in the West only long after his death, took a particular interest in how language influences our personal development. According to Vygotskij, it is only when we as children start to acquire symbol tools from our environment that we can begin to gain knowledge and develop our thinking. Words help us create order in our perception of the world, and in ourselves, eventually becoming inner, inaudible speech where the words become tools for our thinking that allow us to govern our behaviour. In an unfinished theory building upon these insights, commonly referred to as ‘cultural-historical psychology’, Vygotskij proposed that language plays a role not only in psychological development but also in our cultural development. Kegan has also emphasised the significance of language in our development, and argues that words can be used as tools to make us conscious about aspects within ourselves that we previously were unaware of, thereby enabling relations to those aspects as objects. By attaching words to something, we can extract it from ourselves and observe it with greater clarity. Words such as ‘thought’ and ‘thinking’ can help us reflect upon the fact that we are thinking, instead of merely being one with our thoughts, and a word such as ‘values’ can help us reflect upon what we value and strive for. Through symbols, we can name the context and meaning of a phenomenon, and thus enable it to become an object of our consciousness.
>
> Using words to name and describe phenomena and processes allows us to take a step back and observe these occurrences from a mental distance. The contextual meaning of the words can widen our perspective and increase the extent of our consciousness. If we do not have any words for what we observe, we will have great difficulties grasping what we experience. The fact that we use language to bestow names on things, and thereby increase our awareness of the world, or in a sense actually create the world, is the central theme of the creation myth in the Bible’s Book of Genesis. In this narrative, the act of creation is explicitly followed by the naming of what has been created. The inclusion of this is not strange, because how else could we say that something has been created if we do not have words for what there actually is? With the initial act of creation, God creates something other than himself, or, if you will, becomes aware that there is an object; a world that now materialises itself through the differentiation between sea and land, day and night, and so forth. Thereafter, God tells Adam to name all the animals and plants so as to take possession of them. The creation myth is not just intended as an amusing and entertaining tale in an age where no better explanations could be given, but contains an important message about the fundamental importance of the word, logos, in relation to our ability to relate to creation. The conceptual distinction of things from one another and the naming of them is, as we have seen, likewise considered a fundamental aspect of psychological development. Development entails ever finer distinctions and differentiations of that which previously remained undifferentiated and unconscious, but then becomes conscious object. The further we go, the subtler the distinctions, and the more of our internal and external world we can talk about. The creation myth in the Bible thus illustrates an ongoing differentiation process similar to those described in contemporary developmental psychology.
>
> When we use symbols to bestow names on things, the more comprehensive and integrated a map of the world can be internalised in our minds. Symbols simply make us capable of taking more of the world into our mental possession. At the same time, language also takes possession of us humans. We become animal bodies, possessed by memes – or alien language ‘spirits’ – that follow a quite different logic than biology. These can in turn respond more or less well to our environment. Language enables not only knowledge and communication, but also delusions, conceited wishful thinking and chimeras of sundry kind. Often, the origin of these phenomena – from incorrect empirical assumptions to the most remarkable superstitions – is to be found within language’s own peculiar logic, a logic containing its own agenda that reaches far beyond that of the individual thinking person. The words and concepts we use in daily speech often conceal a number of unarticulated ethical and cultural implications and assumptions that in turn affect our thinking and behaviour – for better or worse.

> Hence, language can make us aware of new things, but it can also betray us in ways we remain unconscious of. Language is both an enabling and a limiting context that controls how much of the world we perceive and how we perceive it. As such, it is important that we take responsibility for developing our language in a desirable and sensible direction – especially now when the increase in the complexity of the world has begun to accelerate at such a pace that we cannot expect our current language to be sufficient tomorrow.
>
> The Need for Further Cultural Development
>
> In the same way we need theories about physics to understand the material world, we need theories about society to understand our social world. We needed neither of these worlds to understand on an abstract and analytical level during the Stone Age, when we evolved into the anatomically modern humans we are today. Our intuitive understanding of our physical and social environments thus only evolved to a level corresponding to the relatively low complexity back then. Evolution simply had no reason to bestow on us the ability to understand the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics, nor that of a global, hypercomplex, multicultural information society. Accordingly, to most people, complex societal matters remain impossible to grasp intuitively without assistance from suitable theoretical symbol tools. We still have the same Stone Age brains of our Palaeolithic ancestors and are therefore not evolutionarily ‘wired’ to understand any higher complexity than that of a life on the savannah. But in contrast to galaxies and atomic nuclei, which in our everyday lives rarely concern us and thus can safely be left to experts, society and culture concern us all.
>
> If we want to understand and further develop our society, we must develop our symbolic language to a sufficiently high level corresponding with the current complexity of the world. But for that to happen it is not enough to change our society’s exterior structures, it is also needed that we change its interior structures, our culture, to match its exterior complexity. In this respect our values play a particularly important role. Values can be said to constitute the very core of our culture. Right and wrong, how we prioritise, what we want to achieve, these are all at the centre of a culture. What people value obviously differs from person to person. You and I may have different views on what we consider the good life or whom we consider beautiful, but such personal preferences are not the greatest concern here. Sometimes quite the opposite: you take the apple and I take the orange. But when it comes to which kind of values we want at the centre of our culture, what we want to be the highest priorities in society, we cannot have too divergent views. Here we simply cannot agree to disagree. We may have different opinions on fairness, but for practical reasons we must agree on what constitutive rules shall apply in our society.
>
> For example, if certain people do not consider murder or theft wrong, their values cannot be accepted to prevail by those who do not accept murder and theft. It is the same regarding environmental sustainability or racism. We cannot have one group protecting the environment and society’s ethnic minorities, while another pollutes our world with dangerous chemicals and racial slurs. Values such as these are not something we only, or even primarily, hold to guide our own behaviour. Rather, we hold these values because we do not want ourselves and others to suffer from the negative consequences of others who do not respect these values. As such, they obviously need to apply to all. They cannot be individual, but must – by definition – be collective to seriously influence the functioning of society.
>
> The values pertaining to society in turn depend on our level of psychological development. Criminal gang-members, for example, are often characterised by non-complex meaning making, usually the result of a poor upbringing stunting their inner growth. People adhering to multiculturalist and environmentalist values are on the other hand often characterised by high levels of complex meaning making, which has often come about from a privileged background. It is therefore critical that we ensure optimal conditions for people to develop their meaning-making capacities if we are to change the prevailing values in our culture in a more desirable direction. We simply cannot expect our culture to evolve without such measures. Hardened criminals will not become multiculturalists and feminists by exposing them to post-colonial gender studies. And neither will mainstream bourgeois careerists become environmentalists from reading the latest UN climate report. But an education system and labour-market that better facilitated their inner and empathic development could make them more concerned about societal issues beyond their own immediate self-interest. They could develop a more complex meaning making.
>
> Then again, such changes to society’s institutions require that the values we would want to cultivate are already present and prevail in a sufficiently large proportion of the population. If the dominant values limit us from making the changes required for a transition to a sustainable and more inclusive society, and this depends on lacking psychological development, the solution is thus to change society’s structures to better facilitate personal growth. But making these changes may once again be obstructed by the dominant values. To change society’s structures so as to cultivate more conscious individuals, the general public needs to be at an already sufficiently high level of consciousness to give the necessary political mandate.
>
> Here we might glimpse a classic catch-22 dilemma: How can we create a more conscious society without more conscious individuals wanting to create such a society? The problem may appear unsolvable at first. But the nature of catch-22 dilemmas is that they only appear so from the perspective of a more linear conception of cause and effect. If that was not the case, we would still be riding horses, for example. Luckily (as an illustrative example of the illusory you-can’t-have-one-without-the-other dilemma known as catch-22 goes), the absence of petrol stations at the beginning of the twentieth century did not prevent the automobile from becoming a widely available form of transportation. Similarly, the absence of environmentally aware citizens did not prevent us from suddenly having environmental policies and a public discourse permeated by concerns about sustainability. The current, almost complete, absence of concerns about life-long psychological development is therefore just as unlikely to prevent us from creating a more conscious society. The following will elaborate how such a system change could come about.
>
> How Does Systems Change Come About?
>
> ...
>
> All system changes start in the hearts and minds of a few individuals who independently, with luck and skill, succeed in developing their understanding to a higher level than their surrounding society and culture. This usually occurs in some of those fortunate individuals who grow up in a cultural environment with an exceptional abundance of highly sophisticated symbol tools. The more who grow up in such environments, the greater the number of people who reach beyond the current level of cultural development. When a sufficiently high number of such individuals are present and have opportunities to collaborate, they can start to support each other’s work and together create a new symbol language that matches their new level of consciousness. Eventually, they will have produced a coherent symbol world that can influence the rest of society.
>
> Once there is a ready-made symbol world available, those who are not capable of developing their original ideas and theories themselves can obtain the basics of the new thought perspective by adopting the symbol tools made by others. It requires effort to articulate the ideas for a system change, but it is not necessary to be an innovator to carry out the change itself. For instance, the world had to wait for the uniquely gifted genius of Newton to come along before we could start doing mathematical physics, but his equations can now be learned by an average college student. Similarly, no one came up with the idea of the theory of separation of powers before Montesquieu, despite modern notions of democracy being common prior to this, but every democratic government today employs an army of less brilliant lawyers (as compared to Montesquieu himself) to uphold this principle.
>
> It is therefore not when a sufficiently high number of individuals spontaneously start thinking along the lines of a new thought perspective that a system change can come about, but rather once a critical mass adopts the ideas of the forerunners. This, however, does not have to be a majority of the population, far from it in fact. Only a minority of the population in the United States had attained a reasonably modern worldview at the time American democracy was established. Most remained within the religious thought perspective throughout most of the nineteenth century, but the activities of this initially small minority caused their numbers to consistently increase over the following many decades. The reason that this could happen in spite of the majority being in fundamental ideological disagreement with the modernist minority is that the latter had more powerful symbolic tools at their disposal to generate higher levels of efficiency, fairness, and meaning making. This simply made them better adapted to seize society’s power structures. The religious majority may have despised their modern overlords’ apparent materialism and godlessness, but the former could not resist the material advantages and efficient governance the latter brought about. In this way we can likewise expect that once a minority of pioneers have created a metamodern symbol world for others to adopt, the capabilities it will give the subsequent early-adopters in terms of better meeting the most stressing issues of our times, such as environmental sustainability and higher psychological wellbeing, will make them capable of winning political and economic power.
>
> It is thus when a new and more complex symbol world has been developed and made available on the market place of memes that a new thought perspective becomes ripe for institutionalisation. First in culture, and from there it will transport itself into legislation, corporate and governmental institutions, and henceforth start shaping the thinking and behaviour of common people until they eventually become culture-bearers of the new symbol world themselves." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "We can and should create a more well-considered and reflexive culture that is rich in opportunities and symbol tools for thinking about life’s deeper issues, about what each one of us really wants to attain with our life, and what our unique contribution might be, so as to encourage personal growth. Unfortunately, our dominant culture today is still designed along the lines of the template of industrial society’s demands and logics. In growing up, a person is merely expected to educate themselves and get a career to participate in the labour market and build a well-functioning household as a consumer. These are commendable endeavours. But they are insufficient to create the many conscious co-creators that in unpredictable ways will participate in the new local/global society and non-linearly help humanity become mature enough to take on its new, global responsibility: creating a more conscious society – hand in hand." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Accordingly, we should start asking new questions such as: how do we ensure nobody goes involuntarily through life without good friendships? How do as many as possible, if they want, get a loving life-partner? How can we make sure families stay together? How do we ensure that more people feel part of society, experience a sense of belonging at work or in their local community? That no one needs to age and die in loneliness? Here we need to consider a number of long-term efforts directed at all phases of life and venues for social interactions with others: from family life during preschool age, through childhood and adolescence in the education system and throughout adult life with all its relationships in workplaces, public institutions, civil society, and the care we are offered when we get too old to take care of ourselves. So many concrete situations can be changed to better facilitate positive bonds between people." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "A new system and a cultural change of the magnitude proposed here can never be the result of a pre-planned attempt at social engineering by a few gifted geniuses. It requires the contribution of us all. It is only together we can find the many small and big solutions. This can be done by increasing our ability to listen to all citizens, and thereby aggregate considerably more knowledge and viewpoints to improve society. This can take many different forms. A good start, however, would be to gather around new ways to talk about politics and societal development and experiment with different types of civic meetings to foster better conversations. This would in turn change our political culture, create a more inclusive debate climate, which would increase the odds of successfully creating the kind of society we want.
>
> When our basic emotional needs have been sufficiently met, then all that remains is to immerse ourselves in purpose-driven endeavours and find meaning in the good we can do to others and the world. As such, the gains from a larger share of the population who do not struggle with unmet emotional needs could be immense.
>
> The developmental process that initially appeared as a catch-22 dilemma can be initiated by a few individuals willing to make an active effort to develop our culture by advocating the values and new societal issues mentioned in this chapter. The gradual changes to our culture to occur from this will eventually make their way into the development of new social and economic structures, which will facilitate increased psychological development, which once again will develop our shared culture even further.
>
> It thus may appear as an automatic process, but it will not occur without someone making deliberate efforts to change our culture. In order to ensure this process takes place to begin with, we need to develop a new symbolic language to make it possible to talk about psychological and cultural development. We need new words and concepts to assist this kind of thinking, a new symbol world to accommodate and form a meaning-creating context to make sense of the new complexity we are talking about, which in turn will promote the development of a new and more conscious political culture.
>
> ...
>
> However, we should not, in Lenin’s spirit, want to make ourselves the creator of society. Rather, we should make ourselves a co-creator of the processes that operate within the market, in politics and in day-to-day life. Hence, the choice is not between totalitarianism or neoliberalism, as proposed by Popper, but between unconsciously or consciously created evolutionary processes." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "Our collective imaginary must be anchored in an overarching narrative to give its constituent symbols a firm contextual foundation that furnishes meaning that ties the whole thought perspective it is derived from together into a coherent and accessible pattern. Our life force requires focus, and meaning is about focusing energy in an otherwise chaotic world.
>
> A metanarrative is also needed to establish and articulate the principles from which the thought perspective draws its highest authority on truth that every thought perspective, as mentioned, inevitably contains – however abstractly conceived and implicit that might be.
>
> We may not like the idea of an authority on truth, we may rephrase it and use the term ‘epistemology’ instead. But no matter how we phrase it, we need to make the conscious effort to articulate what our worldview considers valid beliefs and opinions. If we don’t, we will risk blindfolding ourselves and thereby failing to see what is guiding our thinking and behaviour. If we refuse to acknowledge what has become our highest authority, we will lose the opportunity to hold it accountable. Every thought perspective has a fundamental flaw. Postmodernism’s is that its internal thought structure, so beneficial in many other regards, has blinded its followers from acknowledging that their rejection of all authorities has inadvertently made the power of the market the highest authority. This is in turn the Achilles’ heel that is the point of departure for the thought perspective to replace postmodernism; the metanarrative of what I have chosen to call metamodernism will therefore need to address this issue.
>
> Metamodernism must in extension of this also create a new metanarrative that convincingly articulates a story about its own highest authority. This would need to answer why the preceding authorities are not based on sufficiently consistent claims of universality and how they contradict themselves. From a metamodern perspective, God, Science or the Market are no longer sufficient as narratives to provide us the objectives and meaning making we need in our complex world today. These lower levels of meaning making are simultaneously responsible for correspondingly lower levels of efficiency and fairness (expressions of power relations and empowerment). The new metanarrative to serve as a contextual framework for the metamodern thought perspective will therefore need to contain superior explanatory power regarding all three of these crucial aspects: consistency, meaning making, and its effect upon efficiency and fairness.
>
> But what exactly is a metanarrative? A metanarrative might be linked to a thought perspective in the way the term has been used throughout this book, the overarching story that every society tells about the world and the human being’s role in this – and the prevailing narrative about society itself. Religion created various overarching narratives about how the human being has a special role to play in a greater, enchanted world that stretches beyond our immediate perception. Modern science created many different small and big stories about how the world follows predetermined laws and that the human being has a random and arbitrary role in an indifferent Universe, but can still make this world their home by getting to know its alien, law-bound secrets. Postmodernism created a major story of the dissolution of all the grand human-made narratives, with a flood of minor tales in its wake where contexts, discourses, cultures and identities produce a non-cohesive multitude of experienced worlds that humans can only observe and participate in from their own limited perspective.
>
> Metamodernism should therefore have a similar overarching story to tell about the world and our role in it. Additionally, it must clarify its own role to play in the world and in people’s lives. Thus, a metanarrative is not exactly the same as a thought perspective, it is the story that a society tells about itself and its thought perspective.
>
> The metanarrative is a large library of non-arbitrarily catalogued and interrelated narratives. Postmodernism believes that there is no such library. Metamodernism builds and organises the library of a thousand narratives: it organises its own metanarrative. Yes, there will be multiplicity, chaos and contradiction – yet higher orders are concealed within. Some narratives may be brought to the fore, tweaked, and used in different context. And the structure of each narrative. As such, it spites the authorities of old. No, God, Science and Market, you are not in charge – we are.
>
> The metamodern mind, body and soul collects and interrelates the many narratives, looking for the inventors of new ones – for the co-creators of our age. It gathers some of the most abstracted and profound narratives and labels them as parts of the metamodern. Common to these different metamodern narratives is that – in a similar way as the previous thought perspectives – they provide a basic structure for how we might orient ourselves in the world and how new ways of creating meaning might arise. With the metamodern insights regarding evolution, self-organisation, complexity, individuation/integration and the transpersonal dividual, we can, I hope, sense some new patterns in people’s thinking that today are gaining in strength and might eventually make their way into the metanarratives that metamodernism tells about itself.
>
> By necessity, the new metanarratives and their perceived common sense must be more abstract than the previous ones. There are three reasons why that is:
>
> Firstly, it is quite simply harder to fathom and incorporate a more complex thought perspective into one’s thinking since it requires broader knowledge and coordination of more forms of understanding.
>
> Secondly, it must be able to handle more complex phenomena, such as climate change or a global transnational world order, with highly advanced and rapidly evolving technologies, which need to be perceived and articulated in more abstract terms to be made intuitively comprehensible to our Stone Age brains.
>
> Thirdly, a new metanarrative must be considerably more spacious than the previous ones. It must be able to discern opportunities for positive interaction between many people’s vastly different worldviews, levels of psychological development and cultural backgrounds, not to mention different areas of knowledge. Once again this requires a higher level of abstraction in the symbol tools used to articulate the new thought perspective’s metanarrative.
>
> If I am accused of being too abstract in this book, I would respond that it is actually our new complex reality that demands this level of abstraction. To abstract is to pull out that which is most essential, to see patterns or governing principles in a thorny reality. Seeing the trees, indeed, but also creating a sense of what kind of forest we are strolling through.
>
> We will, of course, for the foreseeable future have human beings that think, act and create meaning from very different levels of narratives – different stories about life and reality. The large majority of our fellow humans will still have religion, science or the market as their points of departure. Nonetheless the need for groups in all parts of society that understand each other on a more abstract level persists. Naturally, we cannot fully understand each other’s areas of expertise, the specialised knowledge therein, or each other’s unique experiences. But we might have better shared common sense as a starting point when we cooperate and communicate.
>
> Components of New Narratives
>
> I think that any metamodern metanarrative has to be a story of stories. An evolving story of nested and interconnected stories on global, regional and local levels. We need narratives on all levels to make sense of the world: individual, family, local, national, regional and global.
>
> All these narratives have to reflect many perspectives. Not just because we live in a multicultural world, but because evolution works through differentiation and integration and in a rapidly developing technological environment, we need a lot of differentiation for the cultural evolution to keep up.
>
> But the narratives also have to be interlinked and nested within each other in increasing complexity and scope and be in healthy competition and cooperation with each other. And we have to acknowledge that this is an ongoing process. That no narratives are final. The narratives themselves need to evolve in the ongoing development of our world.
>
> What is beautiful in this search for our new narrative about the human being and its world is that we will never complete it. It is an ongoing search without end – a never-ending proto-synthesis if you will. Any new narrative will have to be viewed only as a proto-narrative in this ongoing search process. It is yet another self-organising evolutionary process, with its own constitutive rules, which constantly challenges the narrative and keeps the dialogue alive. And the metanarratives will revolve around precisely this search for the great tales that manage to nurture and maintain all of our different stories and perspectives that in today’s world are trying to outcompete and displace each other. Maintaining different perspectives from all of our human narratives might help us glimpse as many aspects of our world as possible.
>
> But not to get lost in the postmodern hall of mirrors of perspectives, an artery in our new metamodern narratives is the direction. Religion had the union with the divine. Science had progress. The market and postmodernism struggle to create a positive direction in the story, but at least there was an effort to see the individual’s self-fulfilment as a fundamental driving force.
>
> Any new metanarrative must be one that is directed towards the global, sustainable society, and towards the human being’s ability to attain self-realisation in two ways. We have already mentioned both of them – that we as individuals become responsible adults and as a society attain a higher level of freedom and responsibility than we have known so far.
>
> With our new insights, we can now affirm that it is not, as the Middle Age philosophers thought, a case of using human logos to understand God’s telos in nature. Instead it is about using logos and eros to create human telos in our collective imaginary and in this way build in greater consciousness in our society.
>
> Here, developmental psychology, Bildung philosophy or an increased spiritual sensibility may chart a way forward. It seems to be the case that the human being will develop towards a higher level of consciousness given favourable circumstances. Such consciousness entails a higher level of cognitive complexity and self-awareness; increased capacity for empathy and extended circles of belonging. This in turn entails a lower degree of defensive, deficiency-based self-interest, and a more abstract identification with the world, society and nature. In this way, our solidarity is deepened and extended to comprise a greater number of sentient beings in more ways. The abolition of slavery, the introduction of democracy and human rights, the emergence of the welfare society and increased gender equality can all be seen as steps in this direction towards a more conscious society.
>
> ...
>
> The human being’s most complex and decisive issue in the new metanarrative is therefore our personal, psychological development – and a corresponding development of our shared culture and societal structures. This is the most important project in human history today. It started many thousands of years ago, but it has only just begun. When the complexity in our society increases, the process might get caught in a blind alley – just as it has done now – and must be rebooted again." - [The World We Create: From God to Market, by Tomas Björkman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52773080-the-world-we-create)

> "The main reason to connect to our cosmic origins is therefore not to explain the physical mechanisms that gave rise to biological thinking creatures like ourselves. In a time where the divine creation myths of yesterday have lost their explanatory power, and with that the beauty of our origins to be derived from there, seeing our everyday lives and accomplishments as parts of the history of the Universe could make us feel like the descendants of the great mother Big Bang – a perspective from which we could find renewed meaning and a sense of connection to all of creation. A ‘modern creation myth’, as proposed by the historian David Christian, with its point of departure going back to the very beginning of what we have an understanding of, could be the foundation of a new shared metanarrative needed to foster a stronger feeling of belongingness and interconnectedness to all of human kind and the natural environment we all share.

> "Macrocognition occurs where no subsystem is capable of producing an authoritative representation and where the representations of multiple subsystems can be coordinated and integrated to yield flexible, skillful, goal-directed system-level behavior. My primary goal in this book is to extend this relatively familiar claim about individual cognition to establish that the flow of information through a network of individuals can produce a macrocognitive system. Specifically, I  argue that there are some collectivities where specialized individuals encode information in iconic and linguistic formats, and rely on interpersonal transactions to convey computationally salient information to guide flexible, skillful, goal-directed collective behavior. The interfaces in such collectivities often take the form of “trading languages,” where individuals only query one another about outputs, ignoring the computations that others have carried out. This allows complex representations to be constructed on the basis of locally available information, and it produces a computational architecture that differs markedly from merely aggregative systems whose behavior can be fully explained in terms of a linear “summing up” of the output of computational subroutines that are all doing essentially the same thing. Where we find collectivities whose flexible, goal-directed behavior is subserved by a computational architecture of this sort, I argue that this provides us with good evidence that the operation of the system is determined both by the intentional states of individuals and by the architecture of the system. Put simply, in these cases, macrocognition bubbles up through the integrated activity of specialized mechanisms, each of which is carrying out less sophisticated computations relative to the task at hand.
>
> ... Principle 1 : Do not posit collective mentality where collective behavior results from an organizational structure set up to achieve the goals or realize the intentions of a few powerful and/or intelligent people.
>
> ... Principle 2: Do not posit collective mental states or processes where collective behavior bubbles up from simple rules governing the behavior of individuals; intentional states, decisions, or purposes cannot legitimately be ascribed to such collectivities.
>
> ... Principle 3: Do not posit collective mental states where the capacities of the components belong to the same intentional kind as the capacity that is being ascribed to the collectivity and where the collective computations are no more sophisticated than the computations that are carried out by the individuals who compose the collectivity.
>
> ...  To summarize, collective mentality arises where information processed by a number of distributive individuals (or individuals and technological apparatuses, or committ ees of individuals) is interfaced to allow a collectivity to cope with features of the environment that are salient to the collectivity itself. Collectivities that exhibit such a computational structure diff er markedly from merely aggregative systems whose behavior can be fully explained in terms of a linear “summing up” of the output of computational subroutines that are all doing essentially the same thing." - [Macrocognition - A Theory of Distributed Minds and Collective Intentionality, by Bryce Huebner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18172535-macrocognition)




> "The tools that we believe make our lives easier simultaneously enslave us. The Internet is not just an opportunity, a gift of progress. It is an obligation that imposes contemporaneity upon us... An Internet presence is no longer an additional business opportunity – it’s a matter of existence. If you’re not on the Internet, you’re not in business. We’ll soon say the same about human beings. No links – no human. I publish, therefore I am. Publishing is turning from an opportunity into an obligation. And the further we go, the truer this becomes. This is only logical, because publishing has become a means of socialisation... the minimal level of engagement with the Internet is equal to the maximum level of engagement with old media... what is possible becomes obligatory... Public displays of personal activity, reflected by others and within others, allows individuals to take their place in society... The Internet has become a space of socialisation. As things stand, this space is still perceived as an alternative. But the social weight achieved on the Internet is already comparable with offline social status. At the end of the day, society is indifferent to how its members define their positions relative to each other. All that is needed is some kind of interaction, a way for people to construct their personal honeycombs so that they are visible to others and can be filled with reprocessed content for the sake of status and exchange. This is how people become authors... Can you imagine a user composing something on the Internet without hoping that someone, some day, will take an interest in it, that it will touch somebody? Without hoping for a response? Without hoping that someone will like it, repost it, comment on it?... The Internet is a global mine for the extraction of response... To get a response means to be somehow reflected in someone else. The narcissistic adulation of oneself in others is not just a mark of boundless vanity. It is not vanity, or at least not only vanity, but something far deeper. In the world of social animals, reflection and repetition are the foundations of education and interaction. Reacting to each other’s signals is essential for enrollment, as well as being the basis for both individual and group survival. Accordingly, it is critically important to react and to secure reaction from others. To this end, one needs to be active, often even playfully so, exclusively to develop the “signal-response” dynamic." - [Human as media.

> "Every “thing,” then, is really a process: a dynamic relational event unfolding in relation to all other dynamic relational events. That’s what the Universe is. That’s what you are—a mind-blowing moment at the edge of this 14-billion-year process of cosmic complexification and evolution, headed for still greater complexity…
>
> ... Today, we need a worldview of complexity if we’re to see civilization, if not life itself, to the end of the 21st century and beyond. Such a worldview sees in the complexification process itself a spiritually profound narrative. Moving beyond modern utilitarianism and postmodern nihilism, we must reframe issues of meaning and purpose within a broader cosmic frame of evolution and productive, care-enhancing integration." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "The meaning crisis in the West emerges from the breakdown of the Christian worldview and the failure to replace it with a system of understanding that effectively homes us in the world and orients us to cultivate meaning and wisdom in our lives. In plain language, we do not have a shared sense of reality or core values in proper relation to one another, with the consequence being that we cannot collectively make sense of what is true and what is good, and thus we do not know how we ought to live. The root of the modern meaning crisis was powerfully framed via Nietzsche’s observation that God had been killed by the scientific Enlightenment with profound consequences. The modern knowledge landscape is a chaotic fragmented pluralistic world, and we are drowning in bullshit. As Vervaeke notes, it is not accidental that the last decade has seen a strong resurgence of the zombie, an archetypal symbol of mindless living absent a soul oriented toward an existential moral purpose." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "... consider that the core of philosophy can be framed as the joint problems of what is real and how we know about it. The problem of what is real is the problem of ontology and how we develop maps of reality. The problem of how we know is the problem of epistemology and how we justify our epistemic processes... The individual is invited to see themselves as a cultured person with a named human identity who is also subjectively experiencing the world as a minded animal who is also a living organism and a material object on the spacetime grid." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "... metaphysics refers to the concepts and categories that one is using to map reality and how one knows about reality. For example, consider the question: What do we mean by science, behavior, and mind? This is a descriptive metaphysical question in that it asks us to define and describe our terms and show the connections between them.
>
> Metaphysics is closely related to two other important philosophical terms, which are ontology (which is our theory about reality) and epistemology (which is our method for knowing and justifying our claims). Early in this book, we noted that MENS knowledge was framed by an objectivist epistemology. That is, following Galileo, natural science is anchored to the methods of observation, measurement, experimentation, quantification, and the theoretical analyses of hypotheses. This epistemology frames the world in terms of behaviors that are observable by independent observers. This makes the strong argument that if psychology is going to be a natural science, it needs to connect to behavior. However, this also creates a problem. If we agree that psychology deals with subjective conscious experience at some level and we cannot observe those processes from an objective vantage point, then how do we proceed?
>
> This is one of the trickiest questions that have confused psychologists since its inception. To disentangle it, we need to recognize that we are building a basic metaphysical picture of concepts and categories of how to frame the world. And we have encountered a confusing point whereby our epistemology is becoming entangled with our ontology. That is, we have framed science as a process that knows about the world by observing behavior. However, when we get to the science of psychology, we want to be able to observe the subjective observer. But it seems that the nature of subjective conscious experience is that it can only be observed from the inside.
>
> With the Tree of Knowledge System and its extension into the Periodic Table of Behavior, along with its Map of Mind, UTOK gives us the tools to generate a clear, descriptive metaphysical picture that unpacks the confusion between ontology and epistemology, and shows how science, which maps behavior, can also map mental processes with the same kind of logic that it maps material, living, and cultural processes..." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "For an explanatory framework of human mental behavior, the UT gives us Behavioral Investment Theory, the Influence Matrix, and Justification Systems Theory. With these frames we will be able to see humans as animal investors expending work effort in a relational influence matrix shaped by dynamics of relational value and social influence in a Culture landscape of justification (i.e., humans behaving as persons). We can use these lenses both separately and then combine them to see human mental behavior as unfolding dynamical systems of investment, influence, and justification." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "... humans have a fundamental need for relational value and social influence... Relational value refers to the extent to which one feels seen, known, and valued by important others, whereas social influence refers to the extent to which one can influence others’ thoughts, feelings, and actions according to one’s interests." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)
