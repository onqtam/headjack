> "Society with its dependencies and relationships has been converted to a completely monetized system of dissociation. For the first time in human history, people have been effectively dissociated from each other and are living in a state of no society." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "We need a system where urgent local news can be collected and amplified globally when necessary, and where the people of the world decide which news is important, not official news channels or celebrity nodes." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "If news requires no action, it is probably not the news we require in order to govern ourselves. If activism requires no analysis, it is probably not informed or effective." - [Heather Marsh](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10158316-if-news-requires-no-action-it-is-probably-not-the)

> "Functional societies need algorithms which reward us for being of service to those who need it most. Instead we have algorithms which reward us for being of service to those who need it least." - [Heather Marsh](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7852046-functional-societies-need-algorithms-which-reward-us-for-being-of)

> "Promoting ideas also allows auditing of an idea without all the unrelated distraction of attached personalities." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)



> "While most action based systems can be completely open to participation by anyone, there are situations where an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or engineering are examples of this type of work. While accreditation can and should come from the user group and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in many cases can only be reviewed by those who have attained an above average level of specialized knowledge. In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of expertise attached to specific people, a situation not compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
>
> Idea based systems such as some scientific research, which should be open to all contributions, require extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual users. In many specialized systems such as the pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in every system which affects them, even if that information is completely transparent and available to all. In these systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users qualified to understand them.
>
> It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
>
> In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice must always be left with the entire user group. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only. Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains with the entire user group and the epistemic community is forced to remain completely transparent and permeable. Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user group controls whether those are implemented or created. This authority also provides the incentive for transparency and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "It is the responsibility of each user in an open system to educate themselves to their own level of comfort using the data and user population at each level to inform themselves. Their input and decision making impact would then be commensurate with the expertise they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users. The circles of expertise which promoted them to the centre should also verify and explain their findings to the outer circles" - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

knowledge bridge

> "In representative democracy we have learned that people in general prefer to place their faith in leaders who are like them instead of leaders who are so expert they do not understand them. In order to avail ourselves of the greatest expertise on each topic, we must place our most knowledgeable experts in a position of transparent authority while also providing a knowledge bridge leading from their ideas to the casually interested observer." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The keys to allowing elite expertise but not allowing for elite conspiracies are transparency and knowledge bridges." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The key to preventing elite knowledge from becoming a tyrannical oligarchy is to maintain control by the user group over action and decisions and treat epistemic communities always as a knowledge resource, not a governing power." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Open source software with forums open to all are a perfect working example of fully transparent and audited systems of elite knowledge. While the decisions are made by the developers, review and acceptance or rejection of the software is the right of the user group. If the developers refuse to listen to the user group and another development team is willing to work on the project, the original code can be forked and modified to meet the user requirements." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Online courses such as those offered by Coursera where students teach each other and have direction from an epistemic community of instructors with knowledge bridges of graduates and fellow students is another example of a concentric circle in the cases where the course material is released as creative commons." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Most systems are now run by competitive organizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow and wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement, and more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks progress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and ideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the potential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between the people with the greatest expertise does not happen unless they are hired by the same project." - [Stigmergy, by Heather Marsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20160117235400/https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/)

> "In a competitive environment, a new idea is jealously guarded, legally protected and shrouded in secrecy. Great effort is expended in finding supporters for the idea while also ensuring that the idea remains covered by legal protections such as non-disclosure agreements. The idea remains inextricably bound to the creator until it is legally transferred to another owner and all contributors work for the owner, not the idea. Contributors must then be rewarded by the owner which further limits the potential for development and wastes more resources in legal agreements, lawsuits, etc. Contributors have no interest in whether the project succeeds or fails and no motivation to contribute more than they are rewarded for." - [Stigmergy, by Heather Marsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20160117235400/https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/)













> "Although political legitimacy demands accountability to an electoral process, those living in a democracy readily submit to what sociologist Michael Schudson calls the permanent embarrassment of expertise." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "New technology may be changing the relationship between democracy and expertise, affording an opportunity to improve competence by making good information available for better governance. Large-scale knowledge-sharing projects, such as the Wikipedia online encyclopedia, and volunteer software-programming initiatives, such as the Apache Webserver (which runs two-thirds of the websites in the world), demonstrate the inadequacy of our assumptions about expertise in the twenty-first century. Ordinary people, regardless of institutional affiliation or professional status, possess information–serious, expert, fact-based, scientific information–to enhance decision-making, information not otherwise available to isolated bureaucrats. Partly as a result of the simple tools now available for collaboration and partly as a result of a highly mobile labor market of "knowledge workers," people are ready and willing to share that information across geographic, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Speaking truth to power is easiest to do–and more accurate–when spoken not as an individual, but as a group. This has particular application to policymaking: Non-governmental participants have something more to offer than voting once a year–namely, good information. In much the same way that we devise legal procedures to ensure fairness in the courtroom or open deliberation in Congress, we can design technology–and the legal and policy framework to support it–that elicits specific, structured, and manageable input, not from individuals, but from collaborative groups. If we can harness the enthusiasm and knowledge of "netizens" to the legal and political processes generally reserved for citizens, we can produce government decision-making that is both more expert and, at the same time, more democratic." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "It turns out that professional status has much less bearing on the quality of information than we might assume, and that professionals–whether in politics or other domains–are notoriously unsuccessful at making informed predictions. Moreover, the traditional reliance on institutionalized expertise is fraught with political controversy. Sometimes these pre-selected scientists and outside experts are simply lobbyists passing by another name." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "We want to design practices for "collaborative governance," shared processes of responsibility in information-gathering and decision-making that combine the technical expertise of public experts with the legal standards of professional decision-makers. There are plenty of people with expertise to share if their knowledge can successfully be connected to those decision-makers who need it. It is not necessary to pre-select authenticated and known professionals when structures can be put in place to ensure that informational inputs are discernable, specific, well-labeled, and easy to search, sort, and use. An online system will not be without its own problems and abuses, but the assumption is that greater public participation, not in setting values but in supplying information or making sense of and connections between informational sources supplied by others, can substantively improve decision-making." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Our institutions of governance are characterized by a longstanding culture of professionalism in which bureaucrats–not citizens–are the experts. Until recently, we have viewed this arrangement as legitimate because we have not practically been able to argue otherwise. Now we have a chance to do government differently. We have the know-how to create "civic software" that will help us form groups and communities who, working together, can be more effective at informing decision-making than individuals working alone. We know from James Surowiecki’s book, The Wisdom of Crowds, as well as Simon and Schuster’s new MediaPredict project (which encourages readers to guess which manuscripts will become best-sellers), that technology can be used to aggregate predictions. But Peer- to-Patent is teaching us that we can go beyond the tallying of votes. While the general public has good instincts about value-based decisions and could be engaged betterto identify "big mistakes" (such as egregiously unfair media ownership rules), there are specific people out there who possess specific information about patents or trucks or chemicals whom we can now incorporate into our decision-making.
>
> Nor does it have to stop at patents. Scientists who currently give their time to review grant applications might be just as willing to contribute their knowledge to decision-making about the environment, transportation, nuclear power, and agriculture. Frequent travelers have useful information to share with homeland security officials about how to best organize security at airports. Economists, businesspeople, and lawyers know a great deal about financial markets, securities, and consumer protection. State Department officials do not possess better information than select graduate students in computer science about RFID chips for passports. Immigrants and welfare recipients have information based on lived as well as learned experience to contribute.
>
> In order to make it possible for ordinary, busy people to participate, and for government to make use of their knowledge, government must design the practices of public participation to enable groups, not just individuals, to participate. Agencies must crystallize the questions they ask of the public and embed those targeted practices into software. Of course, not even the best-designed civic software is going to stop government from making bad decisions or ignoring–willfully or otherwise–good information dropped in its lap. And there will be manipulation and gaming, to be sure. But these are not reasons to shy away from opening up the practices of governance, especially when those practices can evolve over time to respond to problems that may arise.
>
> Opening up closed decision-making also introduces a greater degree of transparency and accountability than we have had before. For example, even if Peer-to-Patent does not yield good research or prior art every time, many eyeballs on the application still encourage the inventor to do a better job of writing it and produce public debate and discussion about the application. It drives more information into the open and encourages the "liberation" of government data, not for its own sake, but as an enabler for engagement. And public involvement reminds the agency official that he is working for (and being watched by) the public." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "With new forms of digital institution-building, we have an opportunity to increase the legitimacy of governmental decisions. The tools–increasingly cheap, sometimes free–will not replace the professionals. Technology will not, by itself, make complex regulatory problems any more tractable, or eliminate partisan disputes about values. What this next generation of civic software can do, however, is introduce better information by enabling the expert public to contribute targeted information. In doing so, it can make possible practices of governance that are, at once, more expert and more democratic." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Modern democratic political institutions are based on a decision-­‐making system that is both inefficient and corrupt, as it seems to enhance the proliferation and implementation of ideas that benefit only political leaders, upper-­‐class individuals, and multi-­‐national corporations. Fortunately, this system is also unnecessary given advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the emergence of Web 2.0 features that enhance collective intelligence on the Internet. Several theorists have proposed alternative models of governance that can broadly be categorized as “e-­‐democracies”. These models have been met with incredulity and resistance from policymakers, despite impressive theoretical developments, practical demonstrations, and empirical testing of their ability to maximize the collective intelligence of our societies. Broadly speaking, most “e-­‐ democracy” models are built within a framework of three pillars: (1) distributed decision-­‐making, (2) digitally-­‐based social mediums, and (3) a new paradigm of collaborative democracy. Therefore, the dominant models proposed to replace our current democratic systems can be referred to as a Distributed Digital Democracy (DDD)." - [Distributed Digital Democracy (DDD), by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/distributed-digital-democracy.pdf)

> "Wikipedia suffers somewhat from a lack of easy transparency. The internal politics and decisions of the cabal of high­-ranking Wikipedia editors is opaque to most Wikipedia users. So, for example, Wikipedia pages on controversial topics such as transhumanism or psi can be “hijacked” by zealots with strong opinions, in a way that is hard for the ordinary reader to trace. One can read the discussion on a Wikipedia talk page, but one can’t easily tell who a page’s controlling editor is – how much they actually know about the topic in question, what their history of judgment or opinion on the topic is, etc." - [The Global Brain and the Emerging Economy of Abundance: Mutualism, Open Collaboration, Exchange Networks and the Automated Commons](https://goertzel.org/OpenCollaboration.pdf)

> "In contemporary, scarcity­era societies, most people find ongoing monitoring of commons­usage a hassle. To the degree the hassle can be minimized via transparent value chains and easy­to­use value chain inspection tools, people's best instincts and deepest compassion can be more frequently brought to bear on issues of commons usage." - [The Global Brain and the Emerging Economy of Abundance: Mutualism, Open Collaboration, Exchange Networks and the Automated Commons](https://goertzel.org/OpenCollaboration.pdf)

> "The general vibe of economic interaction would be one of inspecting and understanding the exchanges implicit in one’s choices – be these exchanges with other people or with common natural, physical or informational resources – rather than one of considering exchanges as isolated transactions of money for goods or services without any richer contextual meaning." - [The Global Brain and the Emerging Economy of Abundance: Mutualism, Open Collaboration, Exchange Networks and the Automated Commons](https://goertzel.org/OpenCollaboration.pdf)

> "This sort of global brain would keep global aims (regarding common resources) in mind, and make recommendations to individuals regarding ways to fulfill their individual desires while also serving global aims effectively. It would also guide people to think more pro­socially and to engage in I­You interactions with others and with their physical, natural and informational environment. It would not interfere with people's right to make any sort of offers and requests they like (though of course societal laws might forbid certain offers); but it would nudge people's behavior in certain directions.
>
> In current society individuals’ choices are most commonly nudged via advertising, which has the key goal of maximizing shareholder value for large corporations, i.e. of accelerating the concentration of wealth in a small fraction of the population, and directing people's minds toward acts of consumption. Nudging people in the direction of I­You interactions and collectively positive growth and development of common resources does not seem inferior." - [The Global Brain and the Emerging Economy of Abundance: Mutualism, Open Collaboration, Exchange Networks and the Automated Commons](https://goertzel.org/OpenCollaboration.pdf)

> "Rather than posing as the sole creator of the product, the entrepreneur appears explicitly as the seed of a creative process carried out by a subnetwork of the Global Brain. Of course, something like this is already the case ­­ products already emerge from collective activity in self­organizing distributed networks of humans, machines and organizations. But the tendency toward secrecy and hierarchical organization, enforced by (among other factors) the key economic role played by businesses with a central goal of competitively maximizing shareholder value, places the focus on processes occurring within organizations and individuals rather than on distributed network activities. In the Open Collaboration/Exchange Networks approach, interactions occur among individuals ­­ and organizations form based on explicit exchanges between individuals ­­ and this allows higher­level patterns of organization and adaptation to become more complex and explicit.
>
> The only “middleman” involved, in the Open Collaboration/Exchange Network scenario, is the software mediating the matching and distribution of offers and requests, the formation of teams, the inspection of chains and the assignment of reputations. This, however, can be open­source software running peer­to­peer, or using cloud­compute time obtained via offer­network exchange with users. Donations from users of the software would likely be more than enough to fund an open­source development team maintaining and improving the software. Multiple coopeting versions of the software may exist, much like multiple Linux versions today." - [The Global Brain and the Emerging Economy of Abundance: Mutualism, Open Collaboration, Exchange Networks and the Automated Commons](https://goertzel.org/OpenCollaboration.pdf)








> "14. Congress. Only 9% of Americans like it, suggesting a [lower approval rating than](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html) cockroaches, head lice, or traffic jams. However, [62% of people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx) who know who their own Congressional representative is approve of them. In theory, it should be really hard to have a democratically elected body that maintains a 9% approval rating for more than one election cycle. In practice, every representative’s incentive is to appeal to his or her constituency while throwing the rest of the country under the bus – something at which they apparently succeed. From a god’s-eye-view, every Congressperson ought to think only of the good of the nation. From within the system, you do what gets you elected." - [Meditations on Moloch, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

> "A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse." - [Meditations on Moloch, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

> "Like all good mystical experiences, it happened in Vegas. I was standing on top of one of their many tall buildings, looking down at the city below, all lit up in the dark. If you’ve never been to Vegas, it is really impressive. Skyscrapers and lights in every variety strange and beautiful all clustered together. And I had two thoughts, crystal clear:
>
> - It is glorious that we can create something like this.
>
> - It is shameful that we did.
>
> Like, by what standard is building gigantic forty-story-high indoor replicas of Venice, Paris, Rome, Egypt, and Camelot side-by-side, filled with albino tigers, in the middle of the most inhospitable desert in North America, a remotely sane use of our civilization’s limited resources?
>
> And it occurred to me that maybe there is no philosophy on Earth that would endorse the existence of Las Vegas. Even Objectivism, which is usually my go-to philosophy for justifying the excesses of capitalism, at least grounds it in the belief that capitalism improves people’s lives. Henry Ford was virtuous because he allowed lots of otherwise car-less people to obtain cars and so made them better off. What does Vegas do? Promise a bunch of shmucks free money and not give it to them.
>
> Las Vegas doesn’t exist because of some decision to hedonically optimize civilization, it exists because of a quirk in dopaminergic reward circuits, plus the microstructure of an uneven regulatory environment, plus Schelling points. A rational central planner with a god’s-eye-view, contemplating these facts, might have thought “Hm, dopaminergic reward circuits have a quirk where certain tasks with slightly negative risk-benefit ratios get an emotional valence associated with slightly positive risk-benefit ratios, let’s see if we can educate people to beware of that.” People within the system, following the incentives created by these facts, think: “Let’s build a forty-story-high indoor replica of ancient Rome full of albino tigers in the middle of the desert, and so become slightly richer than people who didn’t!”

> Just as the course of a river is latent in a terrain even before the first rain falls on it – so the existence of Caesar’s Palace was latent in neurobiology, economics, and regulatory regimes even before it existed.

> "I know that “capitalists sometimes do bad things” isn’t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it’s not equivalent to “capitalists are greedy”. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they’re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn’t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter...
>
> And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it’s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there’s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus...

> "One is redundancy: in all of these sites, many of the ideas represent minor variations of each other. When there are thousands of posts submitted, manually pruning this list to consolidate equivalent posts is a massive undertaking. In Google’s case, for example, the company had to recruit 3,000 employees to filter and consolidate the 150,000 ideas they received in a process that put them 9 months behind their original schedule. Another issue is non- collaborativeness. Idea-sharing sites tend to elicit many fairly simple ideas. The ideas generated by the google project, for example, (e.g. make government more transparent, help social entrepreneurs, support public transport, create user-generated news services) were in large part not novel and light on detail. Surely that massive amount of effort could have been used to compose a smaller number of more deeply-considered ideas, but idea-sharing sites provide little support (or incentive) for this, because people can not collaboratively refine submitted ideas." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> The simple argument map scheme we use represents a tradeoff between expressiveness and ease-of-use. It does not formally capture, for example, such concepts as:
>
> • Inter-dependencies: often the solution to a complex problem consists of a package of component solutions that have to fit together well for the complete solution to be a good one. This could be handled, for example, by having ideas that consist of packages of other ideas, along with “fits with” links between these component ideas to which we can attach pro and con arguments.
>
> • Relative valuations: often people wish to discuss the relative, rather than the absolute merits of ideas (e.g. “carbon tax is better than cap-and-trade because …”). This could be handled by having “better than” links between ideas that can in turn be linked to pro and con arguments.
>
> • Warrants vs antecedents: the current formalism doesn’t allow one to deliberate separately about the antecedents and warrant for an argument. If someone claims, for example, that “global warming is bunk because the weather was cold today”, you can’t argue for or against the warrant (i.e. “a cold day debunks global warming”) separately from the antecedent (“today was a cold day”). This could be handled by allowing one to attach arguments to the links between other arguments, or (equivalently) by being able to specify when the children of an argument have a conjunctive semantics as opposed to the default disjunctive semantics.

> We have experimented with extending our formalism to cover these cases, but our experience to date has been that every additional bit of formal complexity seems to substantially increase the possibility for user confusion, and therefore represents a potential barrier to widespread participation.

A central tenet is the “live and let live” rule: if one disagrees with an idea or argument, the user should not change that post to undermine it, but should rather create new posts that present their alternative ideas or counter-arguments. Every individual can thus present their own point of view, using the strongest arguments they can muster, without fear of sabotage by anyone else. This process is supported by capabilities that have proven invaluable in other social computing systems, including rating (to help the community encourage and identify important issues, ideas and arguments), watchlists (which automatically notify users of changes to posts they have registered interest in), version histories (to allow users to roll-back an post to a previous version if it has been “damaged” by an edit), and home pages (which allows users to develop an online presence). The system also provides multiple forms of social translucence (i.e. visual cues concerning who is doing what in the system), thereby fostering a sense of belonging as well as enabling self-organized attention mediation by the community...
>
> Because good argument-mapping skills are not universal, moderators help ensure that new posts are correctly structured. Their job is part education, and part quality control. Posts, when initially created, are given a “pending” status and can only be viewed by other authors. If a post doesn’t adequately follow the argument map conventions, moderators will either fix it or leave comments explaining what needs to be done. Once a moderator has verified that a post follows the conventions, the post is “certified” and becomes available to be viewed, edited, commented on, or rated by the general user population. The certification process helps ensures well- structured maps, and provides incentives for users to learn the argument formalism. Moderators serve a relatively modest role in all this: their role is not to evaluate the merits of a post, but simply to work with authors to ensure that the content is structured in a way that maximizes its utility to the community at large.
>
> We estimate, based on our experience to date, that there needs to be about 1 moderator for every 20 active authors, to ensure that posts are checked and certified in a timely fashion without undue burden on each moderator. This figure is well within the bounds of the percentage of “power users” that are a common feature of social computing systems. Experienced authors, with a track record of successful argument map creation, can be selected to join the moderator pool. There is already, in addition, a substantial world-wide community of people with argument mapping skills. One organization alone (cognexus.org) has trained and certified hundreds of people on argument mapping techniques. Argument mapping is, in addition, a natural skill for lawyers, philosophers, mathematicians, library scientists, debaters, and others who frequently create taxonomies, arguments or proofs. Such individuals may be inspired by the opportunity to contribute their skills to deliberations about complex critical challenges, even if they do not have substantial content expertise in that area.
>
> While this has not happened in our evaluations to date, it is of course possible that moderators may undercut the deliberations by imposing their own biases when deciding which posts to certify. There are many ways to address this concern. For example, moderators can double-check each others’ decisions, especially when authors complain that a post of theirs was inappropriately left uncertified. We can also provide a moderator rating system so that the user community can identify consistently poor moderators, plus a voting process for deciding when to remove moderator privileges from such individuals. Such a “meta-moderation” model has worked successfully with such systems as Wikipedia and Slashdot.
>
> Another potential problem is that the community’s understanding of a topic may shift, so that the initial formulation of the deliberation (as captured by the set of key issues being discussed) may need to change after considerable effort has been invested deliberating about the old set of issues. At worse, all affected posts might have to be de-certified and go through a new certification process to make sure they get fit properly into the new structure. This has also not happened in our evaluations to date – the core questions have been clear-cut from the start - but it does suggest that the participants in a deliberation should frame the “skeleton” of initial issues carefully so this problem can be avoided as much as possible." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "It has been found that users are motivated by two key benefits when contributing to social computing systems: (1) finding their tribe (i.e. getting connected with people who share their interests) and (2) becoming a hero (having a substantive positive impact on a community they care about)...
>
> The larger the user community, therefore, the more potential redundancy there is, and thus the more value argument mapping offers in terms of improving the signal to noise ratio. There is widespread disaffection with the low signal-to-noise ratio of current social media tools. We can thus expect that, as the scale of the discussion grows, users will increasingly recognize the opportunity to “become a hero” by contributing something (i.e. creating a value-rich deliberation map) that is highly valued by the community. Argument mapping also increases user’s chances of “finding their tribe”. While contributing to unstructured discussions is easier, the high volume and redundancy of such discussions means that most posts will probably be overlooked by most readers. In an argument map, by contrast, if you have a unique point to make, it has a muchgreater chance of being seen. We can thus expect the benefits of argument mapping, to a contributor, will increase rapidly with the size of the user community.
>
> We can also expect, moreover, that the costs of participation for a contributor will grow only slowly as the community scales. Contributing to a deliberation map incurs two main costs:

>
> 2) locating the proper place to place these elements in the map
>
> The cost of unbundling a contribution is independent, of course, of the size of the map. The cost of locating a contribution should increase with the size of the map, but only slowly. Remember that a deliberation map is structured like a tree. To find the right place to put a post in a tree, you just have to pick the right top-level branch to place it, the right sub-branch under that, and so on, until you reach the place where it belongs. If the average branching factor (number of sub-branches per branch) of a tree is N, then the average number of steps needed to locate a post is no more than the Nth logarithm of the tree size...
>
> The benefits of adding to an argument map grow rapidly as the community scales, in proportion to how much the signal-to-noise ratio is improved, roughly exponentially, The costs of adding toan argument map grow only logarithmically with scale. At some point, we can expect, the benefits to individual authors will greatly exceed the costs, thereby providing compelling incentives for participation.
>
> Technological and process refinements can further improve this picture by reducing authoring and moderation costs. One option, for example, is “wisdom of the crowds” moderation, wherein the full user community, performing simplified moderation “micro-tasks”, substitutes for a relatively small cadre of expert moderators. There is good reason to believe that such an approach can work. It has been shown many times that large numbers of people with even modest skills can, in the aggregate, perform judgment tasks better than experts. It has also been shown, by such systems as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, that large number of people are willing to perform such micro-tasks cheaply, or even for free if they believe in the project.
>
> While these results are promising, our work has led us to conclude that, to fully realize argumentation technology’s potential for supporting large-scale deliberations, we need to address the critical challenge of attention allocation. For the kinds of topics that most require large-scale deliberation, even a user community of moderate size can quickly generate large and rapidly growing argument maps. How can we help users identify the portions of the map that can best benefit from their contributions, in maps with hundreds or thousands of posts? How can the stakeholders assess whether the deliberations are progressing well, whether some intervention is needed to help the deliberations work more effectively, and when the results are mature and ready to “harvest”? Can we foster, for large-scale deliberations, the understanding that participants in small-scale discussions typically have about where the discussion has gone, what remains to be addressed, and where they can best contribute. Without this kind of big picture, we run the risk of severely under-utilizing the collective intelligence potentially provided by large- scale social media." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "I believe that all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and that these principles now apply to capitalism. While the pursuit of profit is usually an effective motivator and resource allocator for creating productivity and for providing those who are productive with buying power, it is now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap to the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in jeopardy. That is because capitalism is now working in a way in which people and companies find it profitable to have policies and make technologies that lessen their people costs, which lessens a large percentage of the population’s share of society’s resources. Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children... As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesn’t lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic picture—e.g., it doesn’t take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good “double bottom line” return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns)." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

Multicellular organisms exhibit multi-scale autonomy, a dynamic interplay of competition and cooperation, and coordinated collective action inherent to their development, function and behaviour, while being a society of cells.

> ... All intelligences are collectives. Individual intelligence, in the familiar guise of a central nervous system or a brain, arises from the interaction of many unintelligent components (neurons) arranged in the right organisation with the right connections. This is the foundation of connectionism; that intelligence resides not in the individual parts but in the arrangement of the connections between them. The individual neuron is not where all the interesting cognition and learning occur. It is the distributed collective activity in the network that constitutes cognition and changes to the organisation of network connections that constitute learning. So brains are collectives, thus collectives of the right kind do cognise and learn. In fact, brains provide the archetypal example of an intelligent collective.
>
> ... Cognition and learning are substrate-independent. The principles of distributed cognition familiar in artiﬁcial neural networks can be implemented by any network of signals and non-linear responses to suitably weighted inputs. Gene-regulation networks, ecological networks and social networks can all compute in the same sense as neural networks if the connections are suitably arranged. In development and organismic biology, many different levels of adaptive networks exist aside from neural networks, including gene-regulation networks, protein networks, metabolic networks, morphogen diffusion networks and endocrine systems. In addition, it is clear that morphogenesis, physiological function and the adaptive processes of robustness and repair all require information integration and collective action that constitute cognition – in many cases without neurons. Each of these phenomena exhibits the same learning behaviours, including the storage and retrieval of multiple associative memories, effecting classiﬁcation and recognition with generalisation capabilities, and learning to solve combinatorial optimisation problems better with experience." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)

In intelligent systems, the reward feedback is effectively operating at a higher level – and the system as a whole selects behaviours based on the rewards received by the system as a whole. Accordingly, it makes sense that the system selects behaviours that facilitate long- term collective reward. But operationally, each component within the intelligent system is still autonomous, selecting individual actions based on individual rewards given the relational context they ﬁnd themselves in. The question is, what kinds of interaction structures cause collectives to behave like intelligent agents, exhibiting information integration and coordinated action that effect reward feedback at the system level?" - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)

> "The application of connectionist models also extends into the domain of evolutionary systems, where the connections of a network are changed by variation and selection, as seen in the evolution of interaction networks in development and ecology. In these ‘evolutionary connectionism’ models, ordinary processes of random variation and selection act on the functional interactions between components, altering their organisation in a way that positively reinforces correlations – functionally equivalent to connectionist learning models." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)

It is imperative to understand the developmental algorithms and signals by which tissue-level agents incentivise lower-level subunits (e.g. cells and molecular pathways), distorting their option space so that simple, local descent down free-energy paths (short-sighted self-interest) result in higher order adaptive activity (long-term collective interest).

> "Variation and selection automatically produce differentiation (variety) and integration (dependency), for living as well as non-living systems. Structural complexification is produced by spatial differentiation and the selection of fit linkages between components. Functional complexification follows from the need to increase the variety of actions in order to cope with more diverse environmental perturbations, and the need to integrate actions into higher-order complexes in order to minimize the difficulty of decision-making. Both processes produce a hierarchy of nested supersystems or metasystems, and tend to be self-reinforcing. Though simplicity is a selective factor, it does not tend to arrest or reverse overall complexification. Increase in the absolute components of fitness, which is associated with complexification, defines a preferred direction for evolution, although the process remains wholly unpredictable." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "The last decades have seen a proliferation of theories offering new concepts and principles for modelling complex systems: information theory, general systems theory, cybernetics, non- equilibrium thermodynamics, catastrophe theory, deterministic chaos, complex adaptive systems, etc. These have led to the awareness that complexity is a much more important aspect of the world than classical, reductionist science would have assumed." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "As is well explained by E.O. Wilson (1992), not only do ecosystems contain typically lots of niches that will eventually be filled by new species, but there is a self-reinforcing tendency to create new niches." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "The maintenance of an invariant configuration in spite of variable disturbances defines the problem of homeostasis. As studied in cybernetics (Ashby, 1962), homeostasis can be achieved by control, i.e. the compensation of perturbations by the appropriate counteractions so that a desired goal is reached or maintained... Ashby's (1958, 1962) Law of Requisite Variety states that in order to achieve control, the variety of actions a control system is able to execute must be at least as great as the variety of environmental perturbations that need to be compensated. The larger the variety of available counteractions, the larger the set of disturbances that can be corrected, and the larger the domain of potential environmental situations in which the control system can survive. All other things being equal, greater control variety implies greater fitness... Evolution through natural selection will tend to increase control, and thus, because of Ashby’s law, internal variety. This can be interpreted as a functional differentiation, i.e. the appearance of more diverse activities or functions.
>
> However, the larger the variety of available options, the more difficult it will become for the control system to select the most adequate one, and the longer it will take to decide which action to take. The resulting difficulty of decision- making becomes especially poignant if we take into account the fact that the solution of most problems (i.e. deviations from the desired situation) requires a series of actions... Sequencing of elementary actions produces a combinatorial explosion in the number of possibilities to be considered... The most general way of coping with the complexity of decision-making consists in factorizing the decision problem, i.e. decomposing it into relatively independent subproblems, each characterized by its own subgoal. Each subproblem can be solved by a much smaller combination selected from a reduced set of actions... The linkage between different subproblems is controlled at a higher level, where the goal of “hunting prey” activates a coordinated interplay of subgoals. This may again be controlled at a yet higher level, where the general problem of “reducing hunger” requires a balanced selection or division of labor between activities such as “hunting prey”, “gathering fruit”, and “digging up roots”.
>
> Thus, different lower level activities are linked and integrated in the pursuit of higher order goals, which are themselves integrated at a yet higher level. This results in a functional hierarchy of control levels, which is in many way similar to, though not directly determined by, the structural hierarchy we discussed earlier. A detailed model of fundamental control hierarchies characterizing living systems can be found in Powers’ (1973, 1989) Perceptual Control Theory. The larger the variety of the environmental perturbations that need to be compensated, in general the larger the control hierarchy needed (cf. Aulin's (1979, 1982) law of requisite hierarchy). The emergence of a higher level of control, which may be called a metasystem transition (Turchin, 1977; Heylighen, Joslyn and Turchin, 1995), is a process different from, but to some degree analogous to, the emergence of a supersystem. Thus, the postulated evolutionary increase in control variety will necessarily be accompanied by a sequence of metasystem transitions (Heylighen, 1995).
>
> The higher level processes in a control hierarchy will necessarily extend over longer time intervals, since they require the preliminary completion of lower level subprocesses. For example, the process of hunting prey will take place at a much slower pace than the subprocess of moving a leg in order to sustain running. The higher the level at which a goal is situated, the longer term the planning involved. For example, human activities may be planned for years ahead, whereas the most complex activities of bacteria are likely to be completed in seconds. Thus, the functional hierarchy produces differentiation and integration in the temporal scale dimension, similar to the differentiation and integration in the spatial scale dimension characterizing the structural hierarchy." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "As internal variety increases, decision-making becomes more difficult (even if we assume that decision-making difficulty can be strongly reduced by hierarchical factorization), and so it becomes less and less advantageous to further increase functional variety. The evolving system will asymptotically reach a trade-off level, depending on the variety of perturbations in its environment, where requisite variety is in balance with difficulty of decision-making and perhaps other limiting factors on complexity. For example, for viruses the balance point will be characterised by a very low functional variety, for human beings by a very high one.
>
> This analysis assumes that the environment is stable and a priori given. However, the environment of a system A itself consists of evolving systems (say B, C, D...), which are in general undergoing the same asymptotic increase of variety towards their trade-off points. Since B is in the environment of A, and A in the environment of B, the increase in variety in the one will create a higher need (trade-off point) in variety for the other, since it will now need to control a more complex environment. Thus, instead of an increase in complexity characterised by an asymptotic slowing down, we get a positive feedback process, where the increase in variety in one system creates a stronger need for variety increase in the other (cf. Waddington, 1969). This self-reinforcing interaction is an illustration of the “Red Queen Principle” (Van Valen, 1973), which says that a system must continuously develop in order to merely maintain its fitness relative to the systems it co-evolves with. The net result is that many evolutionary systems that are in direct interaction with each other will tend to grow more complex, and this with an increasing speed...
>
> The present argument does not imply that all evolutionary systems will increase in complexity: those (like viruses, snails or mosses) that have reached a good trade-off point and are not confronted by an environment putting more complex demands on them will maintain their present level of complexity. But it suffices that some systems in the larger ecosystem are involved in the complexity race to see an overall increase of available complexity." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "For evolution it is in general much easier to add a component, which is not likely to do much harm, than to take away a component, which is likely to disturb a complex network of interdependencies. This seems to be confirmed by the observation of vestigial organs, like the appendix, which are conserved by evolution even though they are no longer needed. Thus, even though a radically simplified design with much less components may exist, it is unlikely that this configuration can evolve by taking away components one by one...
>
> This also fits in with our general view of structural complexification, where selection first builds up the smaller and fitter subsystems (which are unlikely to disappear in a later stage) as a foundation and then merely experiments with adding less strongly bound systems here or there. When considered from this angle, the selective force of simplicity is likely to only play a part in minimizing the increase of complexity: from different, otherwise equivalent ways to increase fitness, which by the above reasoning all tend to add complexity, the one will be preferred which adds the least. In that sense, simplicity basically functions to “streamline” designs, not to radically alter them." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "All other things being equal, a system that can survive situations A, B and C, is absolutely fitter than a system that can only survive A and B. Such an increase in absolute fitness is necessarily accompanied by an increase in functional complexity. Thus, evolution will tend to irreversibly produce increases of functional complexity.
>
> This preferred direction must not be mistaken for a preordained course that evolution has to follow. Though systems can be absolutely ordered by their functional complexity, the resulting relation is not a linear order but a partial order: in general, it is not possible to determine which of two arbitrarily chosen systems is most functionally complex. For example, there is no absolute way in which one can decide whether a system that can survive situations A, B and C is more or less complex or fit than a system that can survive C, D and E. Yet, one can state that both systems are absolutely less fit than a system that can survive all A, B, C, D and E. Mathematically, such a partial order can be defined by the inclusion relation operating on the set of all sets of situations or perturbations that the system can survive. This also implies that there are many, mutually incomparable ways in which a system can increase its absolute fitness. For example, the first mentioned system might add either D or E to the set of situations it can cope with. The number of possibilities is infinite. This leaves evolution wholly unpredictable and open-ended." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "The fundamental mechanisms of evolution are variation, which produces spatial differentiation of systems, and selection on the basis of (relative) fitness, which produces structural integration by creating more and stronger linkages between different systems. Together they produce the growth of structural complexity, characterized by the development of nested hierarchies of subsystems and supersystems. This complexification process tends to be self-reinforcing, because the filling of a niche by an additional system (i.e. the creation of a link) creates further niches (i.e. opportunities for additional linkages).
>
> Complexification in the temporal dimension corresponds to an increase in the variety and linkage of a system’s activities or functions. Selection for functional differentiation is entailed by the law of requisite variety, according to which a larger repertoire of possible actions allows the system to survive in a larger variety of situations, and therefore to be absolutely fitter. The need to minimize the difficulty of decision-making and co-ordination between an increasing number of activities leads to the integration of groups of related activities into higher-order functions. The resulting functional complexification produces control hierarchies consisting of object systems and metasystems. This process too is self- reinforcing, since it engenders a complexity arms race between co-evolving systems.
>
> The two mechanisms of structural and functional complexification are moreover likely to reinforce each other: a structurally more complex environment requires a more complex set of functions to cope with it. Similarly, functional complexification seems to require a richer set of structural components and connections to implement it, although this latter issue has not been discussed in this paper...
>
> The proposed mechanisms are not intended to show that evolution follows a preordained course towards some kind of Omega Point of maximal complexity. Rather, it is assumed that evolution is largely unpredictable and contingent on a host of uncontrollable factors, which may steer its course in any of an infinite number of directions. However, it is noted that directions in which complexity increases are generally preferred. This follows from the more fundamental result that evolutionary transitions are asymmetric with respect to time (cf. Heylighen, 1992), since they tend to monotonously increase fitness. Though fitness is relative to the environment, it has two components that can increase in an absolute sense, internal fitness (strength of linkages between components) and number of environmental perturbations that can be counteracted. Increases in these two components tend to be accompanied by respective increases in structural and functional complexity, although selection for simplicity is likely to minimize complexification.
>
> Still, it can happen that systems evolve towards a simpler organization, although this seems rare. It is most likely to occur when the system enters a simpler environment, as when an organism becomes an internal parasite or moves back from the land to the water, but these are obviously unusual examples which go against the general trend of environments becoming more complex." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)



Self-organizing communities of knowledge can be aided with better analysis (clustering, hubs, average distances). This would help both with detecting what's currently most authoritative and what might be in the future. We can consciously guide and influence the direction of the emergent regulation.

> "The emergence of a new scientific domain is a good example of the self-organization of such a community of knowledge, where people from initially diverse backgrounds find each other around a common interest, which gradually coalesces into a new paradigm. This process could be observed by mapping the network of authors, publications and keywords in a particular domain at regular intervals (e.g. every 2-5 years), and analyzing it in terms of clustering, hubs, average distances, etc. The change of these features over time may show processes of self-organization taking place. A good theory of the self-organization of knowledge communities would propose a number of processes and parameters that allow us to predict where, when and how such self-organization is most likely to take place. Such a theory would help us to find not only the presently most authoritative concepts, publications or authors (hubs), but those that are likely to become so in the future. This would provide a very powerful instrument to uncover emerging trends and to direct attention and investment towards the most promising people, ideas and information sources.

> ... While we cannot truly control a complex system, it tends to self-organize to a state where it regulates itself. This state tends to increase the utility or fitness of the system’s active components or agents, by coordinating their interactions so as to maximize synergy. The resulting organization is distributed over all the agents and their interactions, and thus much more robust and flexible than any centralized design. Moreover, it determines a number of emergent, global properties that cannot be reduced to the properties of the individual components. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, we may be able to facilitate and stimulate such self-organization, or to drive it in one direction rather than another." - [Complexity and Self-organization, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ELIS-complexity.pdf)



> "When synergy is symmetric, meaning that it benefits both parties to a similar degree, we will call the interaction cooperation. When it is asymmetric, in the sense that one party derives benefit more systematically than the other, we may call it cultivation: the “cultivator” farms, breeds or cultures the other party in order to directly extract benefit from it, but at the same time indirectly helping it to prosper." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

the problem of free riders and the need for control

> "Even if a number of such components manage to find a mutually beneficial, fitting configuration, there will always remain a “temptation” to defect from the arrangement, i.e. to increase one’s share at the detriment of the others. This is the problem of free riders: in any cooperative, variation of individual components will sooner or later create a variant that selfishly exploits the synergy generated by the others, meaning that it reaps benefits without investing any resources in return... The fundamental problem is that this asymmetry of benefits allows the free rider to multiply faster than the others, so that its progeny eventually dominates the system—thus destroying the cooperative arrangement. The only way the cooperative can protect itself from extinction is by suppressing or controlling any moves towards defection. In both biological and social systems we find plenty of examples of such controls: e.g. the immune system, the police, and the judiciary. The fundamental issue in the modelling of evolutionary transitions then is how such sophisticated, adaptive control systems can evolve out of simple interactions." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

mutualism is easier to evolve for different species than for the same species because of the reduced competition for the same resources and the diversity of what individuals have to offer. And thus the push towards differentiation. Same in the economy - specialization of companies reduces the unnecessary competition for the same inputs and also creates synergy from the outputs.

TODO continue 3rd paragraph...

> "The reverse side of this principle is that synergy is more difficult to achieve when resource utilization is more similar. Greater similarity in utilization not only means less complementarity, but more competition for the resources that both parties need, and therefore more conflict. Mutualism is therefore easier to evolve for individuals of very different types (such as algae and fungi) than for individuals of the same species.
>
> Since natural selection prefers a synergetic relation to a conflictual one, evolution will push systems to differentiate their use of resources over time. Competition between related species within the same environment (e.g. Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos islands) will create a selective pressure for them to specialize in exploiting different niches, so as to have a minimal overlap in the resources they consume. The same dynamics can be found in the economy, where market forces push companies to differentiate their products from the ones of their competitors, so as to attract different clients.
>
> Such ecological or economic differentiation can produce synergy as a side effect, since a variety of ways of processing resources (e.g. photosynthesis) will produce a variety of “by-products” (e.g. oxygen) which may become resources for a newly differentiated type of system (e.g. animals). However, the relations between any two components of such an ecosystem or market tend to be weak and opportunistic, with relatively little reciprocity or mutual dependence. There is no closure to tie the collective together, and without a control mechanism it is easy for outsiders or free riders to invade and exploit the system. Therefore, we will in general not view the evolution of an ecosystem or unregulated economy as a transition to a higher level individual. Typical higher level systems, such as multicellular organisms and societies, are formed through a different mechanism, which starts out with similar rather than differentiated components. To explain this, we need to examine the evolution of asymmetric relations." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "The selective pressure against conflict has a different effect on asymmetric relations. Asymmetry already implies a differentiation of niches or roles, separating the exploiter from the exploited. While the exploiter has the power to extract resources from the exploited without offering anything in return, such interaction is precarious in the long run. Success for the exploiter, in the sense of a growing harvest of resources, weakens the exploited, thus endangering the exploiter’s future supply. Predators that are too successful may kill off their prey populations, and thus starve themselves to death. Parasites that weaken their host so much that it dies usually also get killed in the process. Even if no host actually dies, parasite variants whose hosts do better will win the competition from variants that weaken their hosts more. Therefore, evolutionists have long posited that parasites tend to lose their virulence, become more benign, and eventually evolve to mutualists, who fully compensate for the losses they inflict so as to keep their hosts thriving...
>
> Thus, the general evolutionary tendency is for exploiters to become cultivators, i.e. to maintain their control over the systems whose resources they reap, but to become increasingly benign, thus ensuring that their “flock” thrives. For example, prehistoric humans, after killing off most of the large prey animals (“megafauna”), were forced to become herders, caring to maintain the health of their cattle. Warlords who came to dominate and exploit a group of farmers through sheer force first became feudal lords protecting their villagers against bandits, then more or less enlightened rulers, and eventually presidents, democratically elected for their assumed prowess in making the country prosper." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "The emergence of cultivation can explain some of the most fundamental evolutionary transitions... The evolution of cultivators suggests a general solution to the free rider problem: the selective pressure to maximize the productivity of its “flock” without weakening it will turn the cultivator into a “manager”, in the terminology of Stewart, who controls conflicts and suppresses free riders that would otherwise sap the collective...
>
> But Stewart extends this scenario even to “managers” that are non-material, such as religions, customs and institutions. Such social-informational systems can be seen as complexes of memes, i.e. ideas, traditions, rules, etc. that are transmitted from person to person, acting as the cultural equivalent of genes. Just like genes, memes can be selfish or parasitic, using their hosts merely for their own proliferation, without caring for the hosts’ well-being. Examples of such parasitic memes are certain religious cults, such as Heaven’s Gate or Aum Shinrikyo, that exploit or even kill off their followers. However, according to the rules of parasite ecology, vertically transmitted (i.e. from parent to offspring) parasites must lose their virulence, as their hosts must remain fit enough to produce sufficient offspring. Therefore, as Cullen argues, the major world religions have evolved to a generally benign state. This means that they support the well-being of their flock, promoting cooperation and curbing internal conflict and profiteering through the imposition of well-honed moral rules." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "We see that the parasite to cultivator/manager scenario, as proposed by Stewart, can explain a wide range of evolutionary transitions. However, it still provides little detail about how a new control structure precisely evolves, especially when the conceived “parasite” becomes increasingly abstract. To arrive at deeper understanding, we need to make one further generalization, turning the cultivator from an outside agent invading the collective into an internal, distributed mode of interaction that we will call “aspect”." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

!!! ^^ The only "criticism" I've found of Stewart's Management Theory

> "Once money had evolved, a new property could emerge to support a reference signal: the price, i.e. the monetary value—or equivalent in money units—of any given resource. In the present market mechanism the price functions as an error signal, representing the deviation between the ideally desired availability of resources (collective demand) and the actual availability (collective supply). The price is zero only if there is no scarcity, i.e. if the supply is always larger than or equal to the full demand. The larger the price (error), the higher the motivation for agents to possess and sell that kind of good, and therefore the more effort they will invest into increasing the supply, thus reducing the deviation between supply and demand. The price mechanism turns the market into a negative feedback loop with amplification (because a small change in price can lead to a large change in production effort) and a reference signal or goal (optimal satisfaction of the demand).
>
> Thus, the “invisible hand” of the market is actually a distributed control system or manager emerging from the mediator that is money and the medium that is the market-place. This manager coordinates, regulates and initiates interactions between the agents of the collective so as to—theoretically—maximize their synergy.
>
> Note that in practice markets are far from the optimizing systems envisioned by neo-classical economists, which is why additional regulators such as institutions, taxes and subsidies had (and still have) to evolve. This is due in part to the fact that as yet the “demand” signal does not reliably represent the true needs of the collective, as it is subject to vicious cycles such as the poverty trap, technological lock-in, and the booms and busts caused by speculation, and to the continuing threat of free riders, which must be held in check by mutual monitoring and legal control." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "Perhaps a last step in the development of the manager is the evolution of distributed cognition. Control entails knowledge, since the control system must know which action to perform in order to correct which deviation. When deviations can be represented by a one-dimensional variable, such as temperature or price, this may appear trivial. The only “knowledge” needed in this case is the direction in which to compensate—e.g. heat when it is too cold, cool when it is too hot. The control loop ensures that this will drive and maintain the system near its reference point. In more complex, multidimensional state spaces, however, choosing the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal is everything but trivial, and the control system must incorporate a model of the problem environment in order to achieve any success rate better than chance.
>
> This model will be implicit in the pattern of interactions defining the mediator/manager. For example, an efficient market implicitly “knows” which combination of goods and services to produce in order to satisfy present and anticipated demand, and uses a variety of interaction channels between investors, suppliers, producers, sellers and buyers to propagate the right information to the right agent. The manager may also use an external support to store and disseminate its knowledge among the agents. For example, the pheromone network produced by ants can be seen as a distributed model or mental map of their foraging environment, which is available for consultation by any agent." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "While at the higher level there is a selective pressure for finding synergetic configurations that minimize conflict, at the lower level there always remains a “temptation” to defect from such an arrangement, leading to the creation of free-riders that eventually undermine the synergy. The precariousness of such symmetric forms of synergy (cooperation) can be counterbalanced by the evolution of asymmetric relations. In this situation, the selective pressure for synergy makes exploiters evolve into cultivators. The control exerted by the cultivator over the cultivated gives the latter the power and the “motivation” to suppress conflict in the former." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)




> "If causal chains travel more far and wide, we also need to keep more broadly informed about the remote causes of those chains.

> "Such a global brain would solve the problem of information overload at the most fundamental level. For the individual it would provide constant decision-support, presenting recommended choices in their apparent order of importance, as determined by the individual’s own preferences, the experience of all other agents, and the collective preferences of society. Complemented by an in-depth teaching and implementation of the rules of information hygiene, such a system should be able to eliminate the stress of of not being able to cope with the number of available options, while minimizing the risk of bad decisions because of insufficient information being taken into account.
>
> Depending on the amount of attention or effort the individual is willing to invest in the decision, (s)he could either immediately accept the “default” recommendation, or examine a variable number of options in more depth, making a choice that is potentially very different from the one initially recommended by the system... The degree to which individuals actively participate in the decision-making will moreover depend on their own level of education and intelligence. The smarter and the more experienced in the domain you are, the higher your chances to find a solution that is better than the default one, and the more the system can learn from your contribution. Thus, individual advances in knowledge and intelligence will directly or indirectly benefit the capacities of the collective.
>
> On the level of society, a global brain-like system should be able to tackle the problems associated with the complexity and sensitivity of causal networks. It should be able to take into account myriad events and their interactions, and intervene immediately, before any problem can snowball out of control. Of course, even an intelligence of this supra-human order of magnitude will never be able to reliably predict the future behavior of a system that is in essence chaotic. Yet, as cybernetics has taught us, detailed prediction (feedforward) is not necessary as long as the regulatory system can react quickly and adequately to any potentially dangerous perturbation (feedback). Moreover, by modelling the effects of complex interactions such a system should be able to solve the productivity paradox, overcoming the socio- institutional inertia, the non-linear side-effects and bottlenecks that hold back productivity growth." - [Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-overload.pdf)

This collective register of activities is often called a shared “blackboard”, “white board” or “workspace”. However, a record of all communications does not yet constitute a mental map.

> "Because of the law of large numbers, we can expect these “fluctuations” to cancel each other out when many different preferences are averaged. This will only leave what the different routes have in common, namely their bias towards the optimal solution. It seems that a similar mechanism may apply to human decision-making, under the same condition that there is no systematic bias away from the optimum. Therefore, we may expect the average of the choices made by a large group to be effectively better than the choice made by a random individual... As could be expected from the law of large numbers, the averaging mechanism provides decreasing returns: the improvement produced by adding a fixed number of individuals to the collective will become smaller as the size of the collective increases." - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

> "How do we create a world that is antifragile factoring increasingly decentralized exponential technologies? What would it take to achieve effective global coordination such that humanity could do both long range comprehensive planning and factor new information with fast processing cycles? With the first fully globalized civilization, how do we avoid the collapse fate that has befallen all previous civilizations? How do we do adequate safety analysis on radically unprecedented, complex, and consequential technologies like artificial intelligence and synthetic biology? Moreover, how do we bind the development of these technologies to those safety analyses and ensure that they are neither weaponized nor deployed negligently? How would we best: 1) Identify and internalize externalities in the decision making process? 2) Identify and remove perverse economic interests systemically? 3) Identify and remove (the basis for) corruption, without debasing creative agency? 4) Bind predative power asymmetries where said asymmetries tend to confer the power to protect and advance themselves? 5) Account for types of value that are real but aren’t quantifiable, extractable, and exchangeable, in relationship to the types of value that are…factoring the relative power conferred by the latter type? How can we change the topology of incentive landscapes in the direction towards long term life enhancement? How do we close the niches for predatory behavior? How can we better bind wisdom and influence? What are effective types of immune systems for corruption in governance systems? How can we develop processes for collective intelligence that get smarter per capita with scale? How do we comprehensively disincentivize misinformation and harm to the information ecology and epistemic commons? How do we develop authentic virtue in people while disincentivizing virtue signaling? Immediately, how do we make it through an increasingly multi-polar world, caught in economic extraction races as we near ecological limits of growth, empowered by increasingly catastrophic weapons and tools for increasingly effective widespread disinformation?" - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/#:~:text=being%20explored%20here,effective%20widespread%20disinformation%3F)


> "Exponential information technology, in a win-lose context that incentives hoarding useful information and spreading disinformation, has already lead to a post truth world where it is nearly impossible to parse the (intentionally withheld) signal from the (radically amplified) noise. Which means we are making increasingly consequential decisions informed by increasingly poor sense-making." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)

> "We are now finally at the verticalizing part of the exponential curve where the tipping points to system failure are in clear sight. Technology extends human capacity and choice. Exponential technology means exponentially increasing ability to affect the world with our choices. If those choices are consciously or unconsciously causing direct or indirect harm, exponential technology means exponential destruction. In the win-lose context set by private ownership based economics, harm causing behavior of many types is incentivized (see part III of this series for examples). Win-lose game theory, multiplied by exponential technology, is existential. Exponential technology can’t be put back in the bag. So we have to create a post-rivalrous world." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)

> "Simplified value metrics are the foundational source of all externalities, as they get optimized for at the expense of real value that is not being measured and accounted for. This type of abstraction has us relate with models of reality more than reality itself. This is a foundational source of disconnection and decoherence." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)

> "At this point, industrially mediated human extraction has removed 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a three quarters water planet, has cut down 80% of the land surfaces old growth forests, extincts about 13 species a day, has desertified much of the arable land from over extractive agriculture, and the list goes on. It also extracts people’s attention via neuroscience-informed and optimized media technologies, that extract money from advertisers with each click and impression, so they can extract money from customers that didn’t choose to be advertised to, by selling goods that came from an extractive materials economy and an extractive relationship with labor." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)

> "The extraction, abstraction, and accumulation cycle forms an autopoietic and self-evolving loop. The capacity for each of these increases our ability to further increase these capacities…leading to a classic self-reinforcing exponential curve. We affectionately refer to this autopoetic triplicate as the ring of power. It is figuratively what needs taken back to Mordor and destroyed. Or rather smelted into something else, which we’ll get to shortly. It’s important here to note, that when we look at economics in terms of evolving extraction, abstraction, and accumulation, all economic systems to date (communism, fascism, socialism, and capitalism) have been different instanciations of this same core principle. Capitalism has been the most effective overall, but they have all been part of the search space exploited by the evolutionary dynamics arising from surplus, win-lose game dynamics, and this ring of power." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)

> "Economics is a paperclip maximizer. (Since the extraction, abstraction, accumulation cycle includes the tools that mediate the materials economy, and the computing technology, and media, and education, etc…it’s more accurate to say that what we call civilization is a paperclip maximizer, with economics as the ring of power at the heart of it.) It converts the complexity of the natural world into simple (and complicated) things. Parallel to its maximization of abstract capital. And it increases its capacity to do so exponentially.
>
> Rather than a silica artificial intelligence, economics as we have described it here is a type of collective intelligence system. It mediates complex behavior across large human populations. It affects the behavior of all the humans in the system, without depending upon any of them in particular. The humans that do the bidding of the system (extract and accumulate abstracted value) rise in power within the system and in turn help advance the system. The humans that oppose the system are seen as threats by the humans that are winning at the system and are thus disempowered or taken out. The nature of the system’s valuation dynamics condition the value systems of the humans. Its needs and modes of production condition our philosophical narratives about the nature of reality (the movement from hunter gatherer mythos to agricultural mythos, and correspondingly from animism to theism…beliefs about god and country, economically driven holy wars… then physical materialism with science which proliferated because of its competitive advantages via increased technological capacity, etc.) Education is an economics driven system for conditioning new humans to be good wage earners/ producers. Entertainment is laced with commerce; media has to support the profit streams of the organizations that produce it, etc. War is a great system for creating more capital, getting rid of the humans that oppose the growth of some part of the economic system, refining the power of the humans at the top through competition, etc. There are no parts of human life not shaped by this collective intelligence.
>
> In addition to doing a job, it also increases its ability to do that job: The evolution from the linear through the multiplicative and to the exponential economies…from barter to currency to fiat currency to fractional reserve currency, to complex financial instruments, to digital only currencies…from a hoe to a plough to a tractor to factory farms…from digging by hand to mining by shovels to industrial mining, to space tech asteroid mining… from stone weapons to metal weapons to projectiles to nuclear weapons to decentralized exponential tech weapons…in every developmental line, the economic collective intelligence has been increasing its capacity to do what it does (increase extraction, abstraction, and accumulation), just now getting to the verticalizing part of the exponential curve.
>
> Like the paperclip maximizer that theoretically converts the whole world into paperclips, thereby winning and dying from the win simultaneously….this collective intelligence keeps converting the antifragile complexity of the natural world into an increasingly fragile, complicated built world, with exponentially more movement scaling through an increasingly fragile system, until collapse is imminent. It is not much of a stretch to say that we are being run by an autopoietic but unconscious, effective but eventually self-terminating, collective intelligence.
>
> So how do we stop something with this much momentum? We don’t. We build a new autopoietic system with faster feedback loops that is not self-terminating and it wins. To ensure that the new system doesn’t eventually self-terminate, it has to have the same type of complexity-increasing antifragility of the natural world. It has to be an extension of the symbiosis and novelty maximizing, complex system dynamics of nature. Factoring the inexorability of both exponential technology (more ability to affect the world with our choices) and increasing anthrocomplexity (more agents making higher impact and less predictable choices)…an adequate civilization design must be antifragile in the presence of those realities. This requires a fundamentally anti-rivalrous macro-context. Unsurprisingly, this maps to reversing each of the components of the ring of power: extraction is replaced with contextualization; (value) abstraction with instantiation; and accumulation with distribution and flow dynamics. If you think this would resemble a technologically advanced ecology more than an economy, you are right! (That is the topic of the next part in this series.) To have faster feedback loops so it is more adaptive and creates greater output per unit of input, while being aligned with the long term viability goals…its source of competitive advantage (over the current system) has to come from optimizing coherence – of the agents with each other and with reality. This is a type of competitive advantage, which is needed to take hold and proliferate within the current game theoretic context, that can out-compete the current system while obsoleting pathological competition in the new system. At adequate scale to prototype the full system dynamics, omni-win-win as a new type of collective intelligence outcompetes the win-lose collective intelligence. The end of rivalrous game theory is transcending itself." - [New Economic Series: Part 4, by Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/new-economics-series-4/)






> "What is the Post-Liberal Synthesis? That is, the direction of history forces us to consider the looming failure of liberalism, and the need for a graceful restructuring that salvages its strengths. We think this can take the form of a coherent post-liberal synthesis, which is an actual philosophical advance, not simply the chronological sequent. The uncertain nature of the moment is the chaotic process of different historical possibilities vying for substantiation. Without the development of a coherent post-liberal synthesis, this chaotic movement away from liberalism will be entirely negative.
>
> ... Liberalism is generally defined as a political ideology that emphasizes a synthesis of individual rights, free markets, free speech, freedom of culture and religion, primacy of the individual over society, democracy, limited government, division of powers, checks and balances, and separation of church and state. The modern mainstream consensus includes additional elements, like social justice, social and economic equality, deconstruction of old-fashioned social structures, and so on. To make this more concrete, we are talking not just about these ideas, but the current liberal international order and the entire body of social and political practice they legitimate.
>
> ... If the failure of liberalism is predetermined by its own flaws, then fighting harder for it is ultimately futile. And yet, it would still seem we must do something, because a full collapse of the liberal international order is not acceptable. If liberalism collapses without replacement, or is overtaken by misguided revolutionaries, the result is a much more chaotic and uncertain world, potentially for a long time.
>
> ... Liberalism is flawed, but can be upgraded or replaced in an orderly fashion. If somehow we can identify the key flaws with more certainty before the possible moment of crisis, we could begin the theoretical, philosophical, and organizational work to gracefully transition from liberalism to some post-liberal synthesis. Such a synthesis must preserve most of the value and key practical victories of liberalism, and would have to follow in the liberal intellectual tradition. But it would also have to resolve liberalism’s systemic flaws, to be able to pick up the slack, and make headway on the key problems which have stalled its progress.
>
> ... First of all, it will not be an attempt to create the One True Ideology. It will self-consciously be an incremental improvement in how we think about how to organize society. It will be an upgrade of liberalism, which throws out and replaces many key assumptions and concepts, but does not abandon its key realized victories. It will be built in the understanding that it, too, will have problems, and will need to be replaced with a new and again superior synthesis in the future.
>
> Second, to be properly post-liberal, as opposed to just illiberal, it must be based on a serious and deep engagement with the liberal tradition. It will have to understand and salvage as much of the good of liberalism and progressivism as possible. It will have to engage with and address the rationales for liberalism, only some of which are explicitly stated.
>
> Third, the most obvious source of relevant critique of liberalism, where we will find the most important problems to fix and address, will be in the current opposition. From both left and right, the post-liberal synthesis must integrate the critiques of capitalism, systems of oppression, democracy, fake and controlled public discourse, valueless secularism, government overgrowth, fiat money, etc. Even if currently frustrating and destructive, the opponents of liberalism have many legitimate concerns and insights to offer, which should be incorporated into the synthesis.
>
> Fourth, instead of being based on unattainable ideals and thought experiments about states of nature that never happened, it should be thoroughly rooted in a clear examination of how power and governance and social control actually work, and are actually experienced, and in the real processes of how political order actually comes about.
>
> Finally, while being a self-consciously temporary and pragmatic mashup of ideas, the post-liberal synthesis must be something new, unique, and coherent in its own right, capable of inspiring real belief, especially among the elite. It can’t be just a mashup of ideas that don’t fit together; it must be the most coherent worldview we can produce, a real philosophical advance over liberalism, while fitting the constraints and opportunities of the current historical moment.
>
> Let’s not have any illusions: even while the forces of history push towards a post-liberal synthesis, such a major step forward in the social philosophy of society, no matter how humble and pragmatic, is inherently a herculean task. It will not happen by accident, or by default, but will take deliberate effort. A willful philosophical development is required to gracefully navigate this historical transition." - [Towards the Post-Liberal Synthesis, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2018/09/29/towards-the-post-liberal-synthesis)

> "The Machiavellians famously posed a central problem facing any society that meets its collective action needs by means of a self-governing state: the state is only as good as its citizenry, which in turn is only as good as its level of civic consciousness. If the members of the state don’t have a clear, distinct, and self-conscious sense of what their duties and priorities are, if they aren’t zealously and jealously committed to the res publica, if they don’t take governing seriously, if they confound and muddle private and public interests together—in short, if they lack a soundly statist orientation—then the state itself is lost. The degradation of state-oriented consciousness has exactly the same consequences for state and society as those of dementia for the biological organism, namely functional disintegration, and a consecutive level of impairment ranging from the sub-optimal to the fatal.
>
> The dementia of the state is making its effects felt. Most Western nations sit on an enormous apparatus of power upon which the entirety of the nation’s affairs depends. But it dares not speak its name, and nobody really seems to know just what to do with it. The ideological diatribes of assorted malcontents who purport to “speak truth to power” blare out continuously from the academy, the press, the parties of the left and right, and the Internet, drowning out and forestalling sober and serious reflection of the nature of the state and what must be done to preserve it. Government today has lost sight of its ultimate aim and become rudderless. The state is severely hampered and impeded from doing what it was instituted to do by its own members, who no longer even know or care.
>
> Public policy-making today takes place in an environment infested with the covert interests of self-expanding bureaucratic fiefdoms and their private sector clients. Every interest and social agenda is represented: single-issue activists, paper lakes of far-from-disinterested academic studies, politically weaponized lawfare, partisan strife, opinion polls, and a legion of self-promoting charlatans. What is missing? The state as such.
>
> The result is the familiar clamor that has come to define our politics: we must raise taxes, lower them, promote this industry but not that one, remove all trade barriers, put up even more, etc. ad infinitum. There is no overarching common goal to serve as an impartial selective standard for deciding between these competing claims. The “public interest,” to be sure, is sometimes still a rhetorically potent trope. But it has become a joke, since the term now signifies, not any higher-order interest of state that transcends the clamor of immediate particular interests, but that of the “general public”—i.e. the sum total of the clamoring interests it is supposed to transcend. In practice, invoking the public interest can amount only to the promotion of one set of those interests at the expense of another, on the basis of either raw majoritarianism, or plain partiality and favoritism.
>
> Truly “statesmanlike” solutions to these bitter clashes of competing interests are becoming impossible. Since elected officials today are expected to serve, first and foremost, as agents of their supporters, not the state, any compromise solution is effectively illegitimate. It is taken as evidence of elitist disdain, or, more commonly, of irresolute spinelessness that seeks to please everybody. Either way, it is seen as a dereliction of the duties of representative to constituent, and rejected accordingly.
>
> Public administration is carried out with no definite end serving as a master organizing principle for its diversity of specialized functions and as a compass for its overall orientation. It thus deconstructs into an irrational mess of its own details: a jumble of tactics without a master strategy, with no unifying purpose, and no formula for prioritizing them. What should top the agenda? Health care? The projection of power abroad? GDP growth? Climate change? Something else? Why? There is no way to answer decisively or even heuristically once these things are no longer explicitly seen as so many particular aspects of the health and strength of the state.
>
> The forest having been missed for the trees, each specialized detail of public administration thus becomes a self-sufficient end in and for itself. Each has its own dedicated agents, above all in the form of relevant administrative-bureaucratic divisions competing over resources and jurisdiction. These agents are diligently self-conscious of their duty with respect to their principal—namely, their department, which they do not see as a vehicle for realizing ends of state. In fact, the reality becomes precisely the other way around; the state becomes a vehicle for particular interests to realize their particular ends.
>
> This inversion of priorities is not impugned as a conflict of interest and can’t be, since there is no supervening interest that can be clearly defined or named. The state as a whole has no such devoted agents looking after it. So, the only thing stopping any one of them from making the tail wag the dog, and leveraging the entirety of public resources for the benefit of their division, is the host of rival divisions seeking to do the exact same thing. The same goes for the more purely private interests, each of which scrambles to present itself as a public policy priority more urgent than every other. Politically savvy private interests implicitly pay lip service to state interests like national security when advocating for state spoils, so as to not appear nakedly cancerous, and to invoke the authority of the state. But in almost all cases of political advocacy, the link between private interest and state interest is non-existent, and there is no dedicated class of the state to judge such claims.
>
> We are left to hope that, out of the feeding frenzy that attends the deconstruction of the unity of government, an invisible hand, emergent property, or some other metaphysical gazoo will spontaneously take shape. Moreover, we must hope that this occurs without anybody consciously planning or intending for it to happen. Otherwise, who or what will take charge to prevent the swarm of piranhas from devouring the carcass of a state left helpless to act for itself?
>
> It is not an a priori impossibility for competing interests and forces to lock themselves into a more or less stable equilibrium. But an invisible hand is no substitute for a conscious mind to guide and bound it; and any facile belief that it could possibly be a substitute produces unintended consequences of its own.
>
> Exhortations against the evils of statism have not made government small and beautiful. In fact, the contrary is true. Since the state per se has no advocates for its interests, runaway expansion of bureaucracy and public debt proceeds unhampered by its only real mitigating factor, namely the urgent interest of the state in not racking up bills it cannot hope to pay. It has proven useless to appeal to the public interest understood as the immediate interests of We the People. After all, fat-cat mandarins and their cronies are people, too, and moreover, useful friends and formidable foes for elected officials. In any case, the most congenial thing to do from the point of view of anybody’s immediate interest is to just keep kicking the can down the road; the interests of natural persons, unlike those of perpetual corporations like the state, are guaranteed to expire on a brief timeline, following which the consequences of public debt become someone else’s problem." - [The Case for a New State Consciousness, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/05/25/the-case-for-a-new-state-consciousness/#:~:text=The%20Machiavellians%20famously,someone%20else%E2%80%99s%20problem.)

> "In any society, there is a vast network of interrelated institutions, organized into a rough pyramid. The nexus of power and politics, the state, sits at the top, and all the various functional components are organized beneath. Government bureaucracies, established companies, startup companies, small businesses, nonprofits, university departments, strong families, religious parishes, and a vast interconnecting mycelium of informal social fabric. This forms the main structure of a functional society. But by default, it takes certain qualities, choices, and resources to stay on track into the institutions of proper society. You need to go to school, stay out of certain social groups and get into others, study and behave in particular ways to build social capital that can get you into the official institutions of society. What happens to those of us who fail to do this? Those who fail to get in, are pushed out, or are never convinced in the first place, fall into the unregulated between-spaces. The underworld. Improper society. The human landfill of people who are discarded by the system. Judging by their interests and associations, John and Amanda were already off the main track by high school and on the track to the underworld. They were on welfare, and I heard little of real jobs. Lacking participation in a functional social fabric, such people become easy to radicalize. It’s not just that they are at the bottom of the social hierarchy, but that they are barely participating in the normal social system at all. It’s very easy to believe society is bad when you’re not part of it. This reveals a problem with a social order, like ours, that incorporates people mostly on the basis of a local economic calculus, especially in the context of increasingly tracked and expensive credentialing: it’s easy to fall out, and hard to get back in. A lot of people end up outside, and become not just discarded refuse, but active social liabilities. Idle hands, as they say, are the tools of the devil. The local economic calculus has no reason to clean up these liabilities, only to find assets. I don’t know how to measure this rigorously, but I think this has been getting worse for decades: the institutionalized proper part of society is receding and becoming inflexible, and the disorganized underworld advancing, though nominal productivity continues to rise. We see this in statistics on underemployment, NEETs, marriage rates, people dropping out of social participation, etc. But many of these measures, employment in particular, will underestimate the problem; the economy is increasingly home to what is effectively underworld activity: scams, fake projects, ill-advised speculative investments driven by too much money with too few useful things to do. I don’t know that I can speak to the average, but for many of the young people I know, purposeful positions within functional institutions are rare. Their fathers and grandfathers were men of society, working in established companies, serving real customers, and commanding national infrastructure. Most of them went through college fine, but had little guidance from society, and were spat out into a weak job market dominated by companies without much in the way of legible higher purpose or functionality—fake institutions. The psychological impact of these fake institutions is to cut one off from the main functionally organized social fabric. You feel it less directly than exclusion, but how can one appreciate and support the purposeful order of society if one’s own position is not really part of that order? So again, just looking at economic marginalization will miss a large part of the story: even when you’re in, the functional logic of your job, and thus your tie to the larger system of purposeful social order, is obscure or missing. This alienation is often not total. People often have one foot in, and one foot out. John and Amanda were married, but didn’t have jobs. Many people have jobs, but have no prospects at marriage. Some people have jobs and marriages, but no social life integrated with normal society. The more you’re integrated into a functionally organized society you can believe in, the less the potential, and reason, for radicalization. If I’m right, growing radicalization online, mass shootings, extremist ideology, terrorism, and so on aren’t happening simply because there is a growth in possibility, but also a growth in demand. Look at the people involved. Look at their faces. Look at their lives. They are the kind of people who have fallen out of the system. NEETs, incels, the fatherless, and the unpopular are vastly over-represented in this underworld. And the trends aren’t in their favor; it seems proper society is increasingly frayed, becoming weaker in its ability to provide positive leadership. I don’t know for sure, but I’ve met enough social dropouts to see the patterns. I would bet that John and Amanda fell into the underworld in the first place because society failed to give them purposes they could believe in, and failed to make use of them. Maybe they couldn’t get in, or maybe didn’t see a reason to. Either way, they found other things to believe in, and other things to do. Reintegrating The Underworld Ultimately, this social underworld is everyone’s problem, and therefore the state’s problem. Everyone else individually can mostly ignore the problem, simply excluding the growing population of misfits and apostates from their own domain while they fulfill their own duties. But ultimately, something has to be done. First, because there’s actually a lot of raw human capital that slips into these between-spaces, just not in a format that’s easy for current institutions to inspire, absorb, and rehabilitate. At the time of this whole affair, John and Amanda were able-bodied, and even quite bright, when they weren’t lethargic from the methadone that helped them recover from addiction. What they lacked was the discipline and structure that for most people comes from their participation in a functional social fabric. Such re-absorption requires new institutions and the backing of the state. Without the backing of the state, the social gains of reintegration aren’t enough to justify the effort for any private actor. Seth Largo’s recent article on the social integration of a generation of Mexican-Americans through the war and Apollo years is a great example: the author’s Mexican-American grandfather joined the military during the war, and then worked at a government-integrated contractor and on the Apollo project after the war. His descendants married into mainline American social fabric, and are well-integrated in society. A large need for functionally organized human capital on the part of the state, like a war effort or moon shot, can drive the creation and extension of institutions, and the absorption and training of human capital, that would otherwise end up drifting around outside of proper society. Second, there is the humanitarian concern of needing to rehabilitate those who fall out of society, so they don’t just live a life of alienated misery. John and Amanda may have been free, and basically fed and housed, but theirs wasn’t an existence of hope and purpose. The need for belonging and meaning is not a need that we acknowledge much these days—it’s not part of the liberal ontology—but it’s nearly as necessary to healthy human life as food and water. Sometimes, if done by the institutions of proper society, this might look like work programs, where the government, or a church, or some other humanitarian-inclined institution takes a population of otherwise idle people, and finds ways to give them purpose and make use of their labor, so that they can be part of society. I have spent many days walking on trails built by such people in the labor programs of past decades, and I have dishes at home made by people from “less employable” populations, from a company that has this explicit humanitarian logic. This is not unheard-of. Strictly speaking, these efforts are not always economically worthwhile. It is sometimes more efficient to employ those who are well-integrated, and simply ignore or liquidate those who don’t make it in the system. But this just serves to illustrate the implicit brutality of purely economic logic. It might be unrealistic or foolish to extend the ethical imperative too far, but there is at least some humanitarian responsibility to make sure people who are supposed to be part of our society reliably have opportunities to participate in its functional structure. The third reason is that if you don’t rehabilitate the social underworld, it will occasionally be turned to nefarious purposes. A bunch of human capital sitting around alienated from the main functional structure of society will be ready resources for antisocial ideologies. Again, this is a strong candidate to explain the recent rise in antisocial attacks and radicalization, and what happened to our own John and Amanda. The few systems we have to deal with this underworld of social liabilities—police, censorship, disruption of underworld networks, de-empowerment, and social shaming—are brutal, expensive, and sometimes ineffective. They have their place as part of a larger suite of solutions, but as the underworld problem gets worse, these half-solutions just get applied with ever more vigor, and don’t solve the root problem. They in effect just push people away even further; making it clear to them that society is persecuting them, that they are not welcome, and therefore that they must radically remake or destroy society for any acceptance at all. This is, ironically, part of what holds these underworld ideologies together, and makes them dangerous. This is not to say that escalating persecution of the ideological underworld won’t work in the sense of yielding victory for the hegemonic incumbent. Power wins. But that escalation is occasionally inefficient and brutal, and the need for it is indicative of serious structural problems in society. This is part of the genesis of the Christian principle of love for the downtrodden. Both in social logic, and in historical causality. If proper society doesn’t reach out, empathize with, and re-integrate people who have become alienated and even antisocial, the problem just gets worse, because someone else will. Idle hands, again, are the tools of the devil. It’s not just about the poor, but about people who aren’t fitting in and getting along, too. In the Roman Empire, an explosion of cults and street prophets accompanied the growth of their unintegrated underworld as the main social fabric frayed. Early Christianity flourished because it offered purpose and compassion to the excluded of that time, who amounted to a serious coalition once radicalized to the point of martyrdom. Islam worked similarly for John and Amanda: it reached out to them and offered them meaning, while proper society had failed to do so with credibility. So let’s have some sympathy, even for those who may seem lost in the underworld. Sometimes they’re there because there isn’t anyone else reaching out to them and giving them a purpose... Being told by some toadie of the system that you’re wrong and bad doesn’t change anyone’s mind; it just drives you further away, or at best scares you into submission. But participating in purposeful and functionally organized social institutions helps us understand what’s good about society, and how our own lives fit into it, and thus unlocks much more of our potential. Participation in shared social purpose is what makes society real for us. If the underworld seems to be advancing, and the youth are increasingly radicalized, then it might serve us well to worry less about how to combat radicalization directly, and worry more about the ways our proper social fabric is decaying, receding, and failing to take leadership in pulling people up into higher purposes.

It is only when the logic of a given social system, in its political, economic, and ideological capacities, begins to break down that such heroes can arise and change the course of history itself. It is through the struggles created by the breakdown of order that heroes take the spotlight. When figures larger than life emerge, it is rarely because their genius is, in fact, so mythically immense. Rather, they apply their talents in a way that exposes and exploits the contingencies of history, reordering them into something new. The great fait accomplis of history defy all the logic of the everyday world, not by doing something impossible, but by showing how a part of that world was a fiction. They comprehend possibilities that are beyond the existing order but inherent in its circumstances and realize them... The structural role of the kinds of people we call great men or heroes is to catalyze that transition and give it a particular form. Once a new form of political order becomes hegemonic, it is much harder for ambitious people to challenge it. Most find ways to adapt, and the level of contingency in society decreases. The result is a new equilibrium, a new world with a life of its own." - [Those Who Make History, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/05/04/those-who-make-history/)

> "By all accounts, many of the largest donors have little idea what they are funding outside of general topics and rely on staffers and consultants to execute projects because they do not have the time or specialized knowledge required. This directly impacts what projects are even possible under the aegis of philanthropy. Only those projects that fit within the confines of what consulting firms view as “best practices” are approved. Newer philanthropic initiatives, like Eric Schmidt’s P150, explicitly target philanthropic advisors rather than donors, since they are the ones who decide the funding targets. When the actual donor does not make the decisions, it is easier to just work around them.
>
> When funding targets are decided by advisors, it becomes even less likely that philanthropy reflects unique or contrarian ideas about the world or what problems are most important. Instead, they reflect the established ideological consensus. That consensus is itself not formed by any careful strategic research, but by a mess of class incentives, activism, political propaganda, and the news cycle. But from the Big Three to the Gates Foundation, the goal of philanthropy has always been prestige within the terms of this consensus, not acting independently from it. Any future strategic function would have to repurpose this ecosystem from the governance role it has grown into, not rely on the prior intent of its participants. 
>
> This is also why initiatives like Gates’s Giving Pledge have been successful: if one is giving money for prestige purposes, it is always better to associate with big, favored names on socially prominent causes rather than go at it alone on underrated ones. It is not so much that members of these networks are told what to think—it’s just that they are there primarily for the prestige and fashionable causes, and they would never have joined or thrived in them if their priority was independent strategic thought.

They could no longer benefit from airport, banking, or media concessions if the government was truly open to competitive bidders and if the economy was open to entrepreneurial initiative without restriction. Special economic zones are a way around this challenge because export zones on unoccupied land do not threaten the local structure of rent-seeking.

This is LaaS: life as a service. We are so far from being producers and so deep in the mental and social setting of the consumer that even the feeling that one is a producer is just one more service to be paid for. Our sense of reality is inextricable from our sense of agency. With so little to account for the latter, we are cornered: viewing the world and our very lives, not with the high indifference of an enlightened being, but with the detachment of asymmetrical spectators. We have enough skin in the game to keep us locked in, but not in a way as to enjoy many of the benefits. And we find relief from being in this state of uneasy spectatorship in things that serve to reinforce it: endless scrolling through algorithmically generated interest, mass entertainment productions, and “going out” in order to satiate the appetites of consumption in a more directly physical sense.

> "Money, wealth, and value are three related but different things that are easy to confuse with each other. Money is what you use to exchange wealth, that is, actual goods or services, from which you then derive some tangible or intangible value. The traditional view of wealth is that it is not just about having money, but also about having that money go somewhere, far enough to provide a certain amount of value from a certain amount of wealth. Gold and jewels, but also cattle, fields, spices, exotic fruits, glittering palaces, large estates, rare books, leisurely afternoons, beautiful wives, healthy children, loyal friends, dutiful servants, and so on. It’s why you can say the average inhabitant of a developed country today is in some ways richer than Chinese Emperors used to be.
>
> We can update the list somewhat for the modern day, but the principle of having a holistic definition of wealth independent from mere money remains. There is arguably already such an updated modern-day definition, which we term “quality of life” and, ironically, is something Americans far more readily admit is superior in Europe. To say that the “quality of life is higher” in Europe because there is less work, less crime, less driving, better and healthier food, and more beautiful people and buildings, is just to list a bunch of ways that Europeans are collectively wealthier than Americans, but framed in a specific way to prevent this wealth from being accounted.
>
> One can derive value from wealth without being its owner, which is the more important facet of wealthiness when comparing continent-sized societies of hundreds of millions of people, rather than two particular individuals. We recognize that the children of the wealthy are themselves wealthy too, if only through their parents’ doting rather than paper ownership of assets. Based on the same principle, we can recognize that public wealth also exists and ought to be factored in when making comparisons of societies. Just because public wealth is more difficult to measure, apportion, or liquidate than individual wealth or one’s personal bank account does not make it less real or relevant, not least because such wealth is necessarily made possible only through many acts of individual sacrifice and effort orchestrated by unique social technology.
>
> In addition to adjusting for purchasing power and disposable income, an easy way to get closer to a real comparison of affluence is to adjust for hours worked, which lets you guess at leisure time, one of the most obviously desirable forms of wealth. According to The Economist, when adjusting for purchasing power and hours worked in 2022, the two most affluent countries by far are Norway and Luxembourg. Once you add in Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden—all the other countries ranked higher than the U.S.—you are no longer talking about one or two small and unrepresentative rich countries, but 52 million Europeans who are more affluent than the U.S. average. Perhaps we should think of these countries, collectively, as “Europe’s California,” rather than a few irrelevant and unrelated Vermonts. In any case, the 83 million Germans are at 97% of the U.S. figure, while the 68 million French are at 93% of it. Another chart, measuring net household disposable income in 2021 adjusted for actual individual consumption, purchasing power parity, and hours worked, found that Germany was the highest at 87% of the U.S. figure, followed by France at 85%, and Belgium at 85%." - [America and Europe Are Equally Poor, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2024/04/26/america-and-europe-are-equally-poor/#:~:text=Money%2C%20wealth%2C%20and,Belgium%20at%2085%25.)

> "The project of interstellar civilization may seem incomprehensibly vast, beyond the ability of anyone to influence. But it is not inevitable. Like any great work, it will only occur through planned and deliberate human action. Given the scale of distances involved, we will need to carry out the work not only with unprecedented ingenuity and mobilization of people and resources, but generational continuity of mission and succession. This will need to be done without the expectation of economic profit or military advantage. There are in fact many precedents for such projects in history, but only carried out successfully by two kinds of institutions, usually working together: governments and religions.
>
> In all recorded history, states have basically only acted on three motivations: national security, economic growth, and political legitimacy. The first two are unreliable or incoherent for interstellar civilization. The third, however, fits like a charm. Legitimacy is as vital to states as economic or military security. As a result, states have spent immeasurable quantities of resources, for decades and even centuries, on projects that, at first glance, seem to have had no material purpose or value. Think of the bronze ding of ancient China, the ziggurats of Sumer, or the cathedrals of medieval Europe. These projects were not in fact useless but fulfilled the need for legitimacy according to the beliefs, values, and tastes of the peoples who built them. In that sense, they were priceless.
>
> The expansion of human civilization to other stars will not be pioneered by lone adventurers or merry bands of hardy explorers, like we imagine the voyages of Erik the Red or Christopher Columbus. This works for interplanetary space, but not interstellar space, whose travel time will require multiple generations of people to survive a journey, including on the first try. Interstellar travel will need to accommodate not just adventurous young men with nothing to lose, but also women, children, and the elderly. In other words, a whole society. The existence of a society always implies the existence of a government.
>
> More importantly, the sociological challenge of persuading a whole society to migrate into the unknown is very different from that of an explorer’s mission, which needs only the promise of adventure. Like the ancient Israelites, the Pilgrims, or the Mormons, a great migration will only occur when a Promised Land has been credibly found. Indirect evidence of extrasolar planets will never be enough. Whether with colossal space telescopes or ultra-fast nano-probes armed with cameras, we will need to have beautiful images and real maps of alien worlds before human civilization can become interstellar. The purpose of interplanetary expansion is to build the infrastructure and technology to make such scopes and probes feasible. These will be our cathedrals, the legacy which we will leave to our descendants.
>
> Modern governments are often wrongly derided for lacking vision. In fact, they are already committed to multi-trillion-dollar, multi-decade-long visions that require all of society, technology, and world geopolitics to be back-engineered accordingly. The U.S. government, for example, spends half its budget on social welfare programs, especially for the elderly. We take for granted that this is unremarkable, when in fact it is extremely historically unusual and a reflection of our deep commitment to a certain kind of post-industrial society that existentially values comfort and individuality. There is no economic or military benefit to social security, but the U.S. government will use the full force of the U.S. economy and military to defend the system that maintains it. Other goals are possible too.
>
> Rather than a government or religion, perhaps a new kind of institution yet to be invented will be able to take humanity to the stars. But such an institution would need to be capable of organizing people, spending resources, and maintaining its mission on a scale that would rival even the governments of the U.S. or China today. Family dynasties might offer a useful model here. But there is functionally no path to such a powerful institution peacefully coexisting with today’s governments, so it would require a civilization that is orders of magnitude more industrially, demographically, and technologically advanced, where a government that can spend the equivalent of hundreds of trillions can coexist with private institutions that can spend mere trillions.
>
> It is also possible that only a society that treats the pursuit of interstellar civilization as its central legitimating project, from which the legitimacy of all other institutions and ideas is derived, will ever succeed at actually building it. To advocate for space exploration on the back of instrumental economic or military justifications is ultimately more like a trick or a hack than an honest and sustainable long-term position. There is no reason to omit the potential of space to transform humanity for the better, which is ultimately the core and only durable reason to aim for interstellar civilization.

We live in a world in which technophilic cultures are being aggressively deleted, and in which the most productive and meritocratic people are being functionally castrated. This means that even a small group of technophilic, meritocratic families with high birth rates can become the new norm within a few generations. The key challenge for these new cultures will be to maintain their social defenses against the alluring pathologies of the failing modern social system.

> But the great thing about living in a world of dying systems is that you are uniquely well-positioned to replace suboptimal systems with something superior. New growth takes root best in the decay of its predecessors.

In a dying world, all you have to do is create something intergenerationally durable.

> A century ago, Japan launched a brutal war in hopes that its culture and people would come to dominate China and Korea. Given that all three countries currently have collapsing populations, any of the three could easily dominate their region in just a few generations if they could merely motivate a high or even just stable birth rate within some segment of their population. Given that for every hundred South Koreans there will be 4.3 great-grandchildren at their 0.7 fertility rate, this is very doable. Low-fertility-rate nations will have a very hard time holding up against any culturally sustainable neighbors after a 95 percent population collapse.

> We spent the last century or so ripping this cultural lattice from our psyche and replacing it with the jury-rigged modern economic culture. These systems we ripped out were not an afterthought; humanity co-evolved with them. Should we be so shocked that birth rates plummeted and mental health problems skyrocketed when we ripped out a component our brains evolved to work with? Should we be so surprised that as cultural orphans with faded cultural memory, we search for meaning in the half-baked ideologies of Goop, Effective Altruism, and other modern guru-spheres?

> We don’t need to tread the exact steps of our ancestors to get back to a sustainable culture. Little of what came before is compatible with an industrially advanced civilization, nor did it prove itself able to hold up against the pathologies of modern culture. We also don’t need to wait for someone to tell us what is true. The terrifying and exciting nature of the times is that each of us has the chance to define the future of our species through the cultures we create for our families, stitching together modern philosophy, the remaining shreds of past traditions, and our own innovations.
>
> Mainstream culture does not work: it does not motivate sustainable birth rates. In order to make the leap to a culture that does, many of us must create new cultures or significantly fortify those we inherited. Those who will throw their chips in with this massive cultural and demographic experiment by consciously creating a family, and then raising it in an intergenerationally durable culture, will shape the future of our species. Is this an easy feat? No. But what makes this endeavor so appealing and hopeful is that it is within nearly everyone’s reach, so long as they’re willing to try.

Without socialization, most of us wouldn’t know how to use any particular technology, or even what it was made for. Technology only reproduces itself through instruction or imitation—and only when embedded in the larger social organism that puts it to use. Every device not only has a manual but a social context. It is then social rather than material facts that drive or hinder the development and adoption of technology. The technologies we integrate into society become the foundation on which future technologies are built.

To introduce the mass use of a car, you have to teach many drivers how to drive, but it is less obvious that you also have to teach these drivers where to drive and invent those places if they do not yet exist: commuting to work from the suburb. Holiday trips. Perhaps shopping. Maybe a trip to a fast food restaurant. Those last tasks are sometimes recognized as engineered desires, but they are also engineered social patterns. It’s one thing simply to build one car or a million cars—it’s another matter to make people want to learn to drive, to give them the roads and highways to drive on, and make the car the cornerstone of modern transportation.

As a consequence, the 20th century citizens of the U.S. didn’t embark on consumption as mere personal indulgence—but as a pro-social and patriotic duty, acting on the highest authority of the land. The purpose was to create a social order which sustained particular technologies and industries. In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W.

From the War on Poverty to the War on Terror, American leadership has often made its objectives nebulous, making momentum harder to sustain. Second, the right people with the right motivation can overcome insurmountable obstacles. The modern managerial and expert class often lacks the versatility of skills essential to this project, due to overspecialization. Third, the outcome of an ambitious project cannot and ought not be reduced to the objective itself. Great projects such as decarbonization and Mars colonization should not have to be justified only on account of their direct benefits. To do so would harm their ability to succeed.

> "The boundary between state and society is also imaginary. Let’s describe and think of society and the state as they actually are: a teeming forest of growing and decaying institutions and conspiracies in various states of coordination with each other, the commanding heights of which are integrated into a semi-institutionalized, semi-coherent central power, the formal parts of which we call the state. It’s a system of information flows, power empires, social technologies, social network hubs, and inert human resources. A complex sociopolitical narrative of legitimacy supporting and mapping a complex sociopolitical reality that it only partially resembles. A complex adaptive system.
>
> Political order is the structural integrity of this pyramid. It means ensuring that all subordinate institutions stay subordinate, the ruling institutions stay ruling, the loyal are promoted, rebels stay suppressed, the parts work together instead of fighting, and the people support the regime. Without political order, you get instability, as rival power centers challenge the regime, and fragmentation creates broken parts while a weakened center fails to coordinate its empire. Political order cannot be taken for granted. Nor is it an anachronism. It is deeply central to any society, and needs to be continuously renewed.
>
> Active construction of political order, by building, deconstructing, and herding subordinate power centers, is inseparable from the actual capabilities of the state. The central power of a modern society has immense ability to reshape and control nearly every aspect of life, within the constraints of knowing how to do so, getting the institutions to cooperate, and building necessary machinery. Almost nothing can be done by pure fiat, but almost anything can be done. The game is much more about mapping and manipulating this actual ruling structure towards a generally defined end than it is about twiddling technocratic policy knobs.
>
> To update our question, then, what does it even mean to be in charge of such a thing? How shall its power be organized behind our own conception of the good?
>
> Being in charge means being in a position of strong influence over the central powerful institutions in the empire in question. It means having a deep and fluent understanding of power, especially our own base of power. Being in charge is a much more active position. At the same time, it means identifying ourselves with the center of an institutional machine larger than ourselves, becoming an instrument of its imagination, and thinking up ideas of what to do with its power, from its own perspective. Being in charge becomes a mixture of actively maneuvering to build and possess the institution, and playing a role in letting it possess you.
>
> With this more active set of concerns, our perspective shifts again. We come to focus on the institutions themselves, on building and repairing a base of power, on maintaining information flows, sniffing out and resolving discoordination, and on finding new ways to extend the power to accomplish our vision, including by empowering others. We aggressively centralize power here, and apply a restrained decentralization there.
>
> This is very different from the initial focus on twiddling policy knobs in pursuit of a naively imagined objective notion of responsible government. This is also a much firmer set of realities on which to ground the idea of good policy: good policy must actively maintain and develop political order in the complex system of society.
>
> Again, this is another step towards a healthier way of seeing things. We’re engaging more with actual reality, and building a much more organic, responsive, and politically inclusive sort of regime. And we’re also starting to ground the perspective of the state in something more solid.

> "The end result of this transition will be a new kind of meta-organism above both biological life and machines, encompassing and unifying what we separately call ecosystems, civilizations, peoples, cultures, states, and industrial stacks. These garden empires will increasingly blur such distinctions as peoples become inseparable from the symbiotic industrial and biological ecosystems they maintain as their bases of power. As the power and impact of civilization increases, nearly all aspects of what is now the environment will be internalized as its internal organic processes.
>
> For example, as with our photosynthetic predecessors, scaling up our energy economy with fossil fuels has destroyed our comfortable post-Ice Age climate equilibrium. Unlike previously, life may now have the power and intelligence to simply solve such problems by directly geo-engineering the stable climate that we prefer. Thus the climate itself would become internal to the teleological fabric of life. The atmosphere would no longer be part of the environment, but yet another organic fluid-like cellular cytoplasm or blood plasma. The climate will not be the only process subsumed in this manner. 
>
> Unlike replicator evolution and animal intelligence, cultural intelligence has no immediate technical scaling limit. When it is freed from technical constraint, the fundamental tendency of complex order is to grow and integrate. Trade globalizes. Power centralizes. Intelligence organizes. So we might imagine that the outcome of this transition will be a unified whole Earth as a single planetary meta-organism: the Gaia hypothesis made real. This is Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s noosphere, the global consciousness that grows out of and unifies the biosphere. 
>
> Influenced by such ideas, our twentieth-century predecessors imagined that planetary environmental problems meant planetary governance solutions. Excited at the prospect of being able to fulfill the enlightenment ideal of a rationalistic universal polity, they used global environmental issues and arguments about globalization to justify their political projects. 
>
> But despite the lack of technical barriers to this unification, political unity only happens at the expense of the ambitions of its constituents. It is only ever justified by the presence of some even more pressing external need. In the absence of an outside threat, the tendency for all internal suborders is to push apart and cannibalize the political commons for their particular gain. This has been the eventual fate of all attempted universal empires in history and myth all the way back to the Tower of Babel. 
>
> So despite the centralizing tendency, the most natural outcome for this new order of life is not full unification but a diverse patchwork or multipolar balance of powers that only partially cooperate, and mostly compete within the shared noosphere. This is fortunate in a way, because all individual organisms are mortal. A diversity of powers is necessary for life to survive the inevitable rise and fall of particular powers.

> "Wang recorded his observations in a memoir that would become his most famous work: the 1991 book America Against America. In it, he marvels at homeless encampments in the streets of Washington DC, out-of-control drug crime in poor black neighborhoods in New York and San Francisco, and corporations that seemed to have fused themselves to and taken over responsibilities of government. Eventually, he concludes that America faces an “unstoppable undercurrent of crisis” produced by its societal contradictions, including between rich and poor, white and black, democratic and oligarchic power, egalitarianism and class privilege, individual rights and collective responsibilities, cultural traditions and the solvent of liquid modernity. But while Americans can, he says, perceive that they are faced with “intricate social and cultural problems,” they “tend to think of them as scientific and technological problems” to be solved separately. This gets them nowhere, he argues, because their problems are in fact all inextricably interlinked and have the same root cause: a radical, nihilistic individualism at the heart of modern American liberalism. “The real cell of society in the United States is the individual,” he finds. This is so because the cell most foundational (per Aristotle) to society, “the family, has disintegrated.” Meanwhile, in the American system, “everything has a dual nature, and the glamour of high commodification abounds. Human flesh, sex, knowledge, politics, power, and law can all become the target of commodification.” This “commodification, in many ways, corrupts society and leads to a number of serious social problems.” In the end, “the American economic system has created human loneliness” as its foremost product, along with spectacular inequality. As a result, “nihilism has become the American way, which is a fatal shock to cultural development and the American spirit.” Moreover, he says that the “American spirit is facing serious challenges” from new ideational competitors. Reflecting on the universities he visited and quoting approvingly from Allan Bloom’s The Closing of the American Mind, he notes a growing tension between Enlightenment liberal rationalism and a “younger generation [that] is ignorant of traditional Western values” and actively rejects its cultural inheritance. “If the value system collapses,” he wonders, “how can the social system be sustained?” Ultimately, he argues, when faced with critical social issues like drug addiction, America’s atomized, deracinated, and dispirited society has found itself with “an insurmountable problem” because it no longer has any coherent conceptual grounds from which to mount any resistance." - [The Triumph and Terror of Wang Huning, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/)

> "From the smug point of view of millions who now inhabit the Chinese internet, Wang’s dark vision of American dissolution was nothing less than prophetic. When they look to the U.S., they no longer see a beacon of liberal democracy standing as an admired symbol of a better future. That was the impression of those who created the famous “Goddess of Democracy,” with her paper-mâché torch held aloft before the Gate of Heavenly Peace. Instead, they see Wang’s America: deindustrialization, rural decay, over-financialization, out of control asset prices, and the emergence of a self-perpetuating rentier elite; powerful tech monopolies able to crush any upstart competitors operating effectively beyond the scope of government; immense economic inequality, chronic unemployment, addiction, homelessness, and crime; cultural chaos, historical nihilism, family breakdown, and plunging fertility rates; societal despair, spiritual malaise, social isolation, and skyrocketing rates of mental health issues; a loss of national unity and purpose in the face of decadence and barely concealed self-loathing; vast internal divisions, racial tensions, riots, political violence, and a country that increasingly seems close to coming apart. As a tumultuous 2020 roiled American politics, Chinese people began turning to Wang’s America Against America for answers. And when a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021, the book flew off the shelves. Out-of-print copies began selling for as much as $2,500 on Chinese e-commerce sites. But Wang is unlikely to be savoring the acclaim, because his worst fear has become reality: the “unstoppable undercurrent of crisis” he identified in America seems to have successfully jumped the Pacific. Despite all his and Xi’s success in draconian suppression of political liberalism, many of the same problems Wang observed in America have nonetheless emerged to ravage China over the last decade as the country progressively embraced a more neoliberal capitalist economic model." - [The Triumph and Terror of Wang Huning, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/)

> "So while Americans have today given up the old dream of liberalizing China, they should maybe look a little closer. It’s true that China never remotely liberalized—if you consider liberalism to be all about democratic elections, a free press, and respect for human rights. But many political thinkers would argue there is more to a comprehensive definition of modern liberalism than that. Instead, they would identify liberalism’s essential telos as being the liberation of the individual from all limiting ties of place, tradition, religion, associations, and relationships, along with all the material limits of nature, in pursuit of the radical autonomy of the modern “consumer.” From this perspective, China has been thoroughly liberalized, and the picture of what’s happening to Chinese society begins to look far more like Wang’s nightmare of a liberal culture consumed by nihilistic individualism and commodification." - [The Triumph and Terror of Wang Huning, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/)

> "In simplified terms, we can think of companies as organized to create value and sustain themselves by capturing a portion of the created value as financial profit. When executives, board members, and major investors manage companies by and for the bottom line, they operate on a theory of the company as a vehicle solely for capturing profit. When this happens, the difficult and holistic question of creating value in the first place—a question unique for every company—simply goes unaddressed. It is treated as a permanently solved, one-time problem that no longer merits attention or resources; at Boeing, for instance, senior engineers were reportedly told they were no longer needed because Boeing’s products were “mature,” as if it was impossible for further progress in airplanes to ever be made. The focus is instead on raising profit margins and share prices through cost-cutting and various other attempts to improve efficiency or appeal to investors. This school of thought appears to be the dominant one in the influential U.S. financial sector and might be termed “shareholder capitalism.”
>
> A distinct but also ascendant school of thought might be called “stakeholder capitalism,” as promoted by economists like the World Economic Forum’s Klaus Schwab and institutionalized through measures like “ESG” or “DEI.” Rather than harshly optimizing for capturing profit, this school of thought essentially teaches that the value companies can create is not limited to financial value for shareholders or useful products for customers, but also includes intangible value for a company’s own employees, society writ large, the government, and even the natural environment. A company can legitimately create value by mobilizing its managers and employees to participate in efforts to solve problems entirely unrelated to a company’s unique specialties or product offerings. In practice, this means companies mainly try to imitate new fashions or implement received wisdom in an undifferentiated way.
>
> There does exist a school of thought that teaches that a company is meant to create as much value as possible through specialization and breakthrough improvements in products. But it appears to be largely limited to the software engineers of Silicon Valley, only semi-institutionalized through organizations like Y Combinator or the bottom-up cults of personality surrounding exceptionally successful startup founders and venture capitalists. Outside of software and the few domains where former software entrepreneurs have already founded new market entrants, creating more unique and tangible value is at best a secondary concern after capturing more profit or contributing to the intangible value of a society with socially conscious firms.
>
> This implies that much of the modern economy is not even trying to undertake productive economic activity as it is commonly understood. Though surprising, this conclusion seems to provide a satisfying and elegant explanation for many contemporary socioeconomic mysteries. Though MBAs, financiers, managers, or accountants are perhaps more inclined to view a company as a vehicle for capturing profits or intangibly contributing to society, there is nothing preventing trained engineers from inclining toward the same views as well. After all, engineers are formally trained in engineering, not in an alternative theory of business management.

> When Intel passed on the iPhone, it was forgoing an expensive and complicated project in many ways at odds with the technical attributes of Intel’s more arcane and power-hungry chips, which were more suited for desktop computers than phones. This saved Intel a lot of money in the short run. But in the long run, it amounted to giving up Intel’s leadership in a still rapidly-growing computing industry. Both value creation and profit capture would have likely been better served in the long run by taking the chance and using it as an opportunity to mobilize Intel’s engineers. Boeing should not have risked the integrity of its traditions of engineering and manufacturing to cut a few financial corners. Sony did not have to stop experimenting with new consumer devices. There was no inevitable condition of physics or markets that necessitated these companies’ decisions, only the contingent and avoidable succession failure that resulted in leaders unable to create value.
>
> Every company attempting to achieve a particular material outcome—whether this means building the most advanced semiconductors, the most reliable airplanes, or the most popular electronic devices—is an extremely fragile organism behind the gleaming headquarters, world-renowned brand, and army of salaried professionals. Without attentive, zealous, and knowledgeable leadership from the top, even the most well-resourced companies will quickly devolve from innovation and functionality into stagnation and dysfunction, as the local, day-to-day priorities of employees and executives diverge from the overall mission and wider circumstances change without a commensurate change in strategy. The careful alignment of people and priorities needed to deliver efficiency, quality, and innovation can be irreparably shattered with just one chief executive who temporarily prioritizes a different goal.
>
> Without fresh founders and seasoned industrialists seeking to create value through breakthroughs in science, technology, design, or logistics, industries and the companies they consist of do not disappear entirely, but limp along outside the public eye. Interestingly, they also morph in a distinct way, developing certain features very different from companies in a competitive and growing industry.
>
> One unmistakable pattern is what I term the “portfolio theory of the firm.” This is the phenomenon of executives, board members, and investors treating a company not like a single, fragile organization of human beings, but like a grab-bag of different assets that can be rearranged or traded out until the sum of their financial figures adds up favorably—like an investment portfolio. The company becomes not the organization itself, but the financial product wrapped around it. Such companies demonstrate a strong tendency for regular acquisitions, mergers, divestments, spinoffs, rebrands, and internal reorganizations, as executives tear apart and stitch together new combinations of brands and divisions in the quest for the ideal bottom line." - [When the Mismanagerial Class Destroys Great Companies, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2024/08/30/when-the-mismanagerial-class-destroys-great-companies/)

In our society, one of these is a dissonant evaluation of elites. America’s elites are seen to be simultaneously all powerful and completely incompetent. When great and terrible events come — natural or man-made — politicians, social media magnates, university presidents, billionaires, and others are ascribed agency over events, and we expect that they should use it. Why haven’t they done everything in their power to prevent crisis? Yet when elites gather together to discuss how best to act, their forums become synonymous with malice and conspiracy.

> "Many view elites as by nature playing an adversarial role, the details inline with the framework of one’s political views. While this is understandable, and many charges are levied rightfully in spirit if not in letter, it is too easy to confuse elite failure or dysfunction, even widespread, with a case against elites per se. In a time of failing institutions and frequent crises such as ours, it would not be right to exonerate elites from responsibility, perhaps quite the contrary. However, it is also worth noting that elites are not solely a negative influence on society, and in fact serve several crucial roles to its functioning. Without a functioning elite, we could not have a functioning society.
>
> A society is best thought of as an ecosystem of mutually dependent institutions. Where those institutions are abundant, well-designed, and functional, we will find a flourishing society and civilization. Where they are few, poorly designed, or dysfunctional, we will find a broken and decaying society. Throughout history, the best institutions outperform others by many orders of magnitude—functional institutions are the exception. It is better to have one functional institution than one hundred dysfunctional ones.
>
> Elites are necessary to marshal the requisite resources, talent, and enthusiasm to found new functional institutions and refound old ones. Nobody else has the influence and independence to do so. Founding an institution is very hard, founding a functional one much harder, and refounding a dysfunctional one perhaps the hardest of all. The difficulty is not just technical but also political. These tasks are hard enough for elites, much less you or me, and by succeeding at them, elites help create a flourishing society that benefits everyone. Furthermore, founding important functional institutions tends to rightfully make elites of those who found them. Without elites, we would have far fewer and far less functional institutions. A society without elites would necessarily decay and get worse for everyone in it.
>
> Another important role that elites play is in the regulation of status and prestige within society. Not all societies in history have been motivated primarily by the same concerns. Some could be distinguished by their focus on economic concerns, others on scientific, martial, religious, or humanitarian ones. But all of them had a system of awarding, regulating, and seizing status and prestige and, in fact, that system is the engine that drives a society to concern itself with something or other beyond its mere survival." - [Reform Is Driven by Rising Elites, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/08/19/reform-is-driven-by-rising-elites/)

> "Implicit in the ESG framework is the idea that investors can discipline firms and whole economies to be more aligned with social and political goals. But the finance industry does not possess the ability to discipline firms in this way. In practice, ESG funds do not move financial capital towards different goals: not only do these funds underperform on the market, but the amount of capital they are able to raise already appears to be slowing after the initial period of excitement. Theoretically, the primary mechanism to discipline business decisions would be the voting power of shareholders, especially in replacing board members and executives. But shareholders rarely exercise such disciplining power: in the most recent voting data, Blackrock supported 90 percent of directors standing for election, and Vanguard supported 91 percent. In other words, institutional investors tend to go with the flow of company leadership decisions. Even in high-profile exceptions, such as the time Exxon lost three of its board members to shareholder activism in 2021 due to environmental concerns, the actual impact is muted. Despite long-term pledges to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, Exxon plans to continue expanding oil production for the next decade and has been rewarded by stock price growth that’s beaten the market and the oil industry as a whole since 2021. Despite this ineffectiveness in reaching its stated goals, the world’s largest investors continue to institutionalize ESG in both business practice and ideological marketing. Its rise does not mark a departure from the finance industry’s interest in the maximization of value extraction, nor does it represent a serious attempt to deal with any of society’s supposed ills. ESG should instead be understood as a pure and simple luxury commodity for those who need ownership of financial assets to maintain their position in society, with a new language of justification for the same decisions. Central to it is the conspicuous consumption of the bourgeoisie—owners, investors, and shareholders—as well as high-earning professionals. This means that ESG is neither an improved concept of fiduciary duty nor a veiled attempt to impose a planned economy. Rather, it is yet another symptom of an ossified society that is primarily centered around conspicuous consumption. Capitalism may still be dominant, but the individual capitalists have become averse to direct action. In reality, desirable social outcomes are achieved by taking on risks to build organizations and mobilize people and resources toward them. ESG is the perfect luxury financial good for those who fear taking on the challenge of acting on the world directly." - [ESG Is the Opium of the Investors, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/05/05/esg-is-the-opium-of-the-investors/)

> "The financial innovation of ESG incorporates the ideological desires of investors into the very same financial assets which sustain them. Actually achieving these goals would require taking the risk of building the organizations to carry them out, and evaluating whether they are worth pursuing at all demands independent judgment. Purchasing the commodified feeling of doing good for society demands neither. ESG mollifies investors into believing they are changing the world while making money at the same time. All they are buying, in reality, are various claims to future cash flows with feel-good marketing attached, eliminating the need to actively take steps to directly achieve their goals.
>
> Ironically, the theory that ESG is a gateway to a planned economy assumes that the will to mobilize national wealth and labor power toward well-defined goals of production still exists in an organized, large-scale way. But the ephemerality of ESG would make it a completely useless tool for such a project. Vague metrics do not work on the level of planned economies for the same reason they do not work in individual businesses: clear goals and clear procedures for getting there are how you actually get things done. They do, however, make perfect sense for a luxury financial instrument whose primary purpose is vicarious philanthropy.

> Karl Marx once called religion the “opium of the people,” a numbing agent that brings a semblance of joy in an otherwise desolate world but prevents serious attempts to change one’s circumstances. ESG finance operates as opium for the bourgeoisie: the ultimate symbol of their degradation from historical agents into passive consumers. The existence of ESG signals the final exhaustion of this class. In changing the finance industry so dramatically, nothing has changed in the real world at all. The future of the environment and of society will be decided without input from ESG funds and their investors, even as they continue to seek out the streams of money which insist on their importance." - [ESG Is the Opium of the Investors, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/05/05/esg-is-the-opium-of-the-investors/)

Modern history is littered with misguided, elaborate plans, derailed by surprise events. The most damning pretension of our time is our belief that we can model, predict, and control what we cannot... For Taleb, most social scientists are priests of the humanist faith, advocating for policies based on dangerously reductive understandings of unknowably complex systems. His favorite target is our byzantine regulatory structures. Though designed to mitigate systemic risk in the financial sector, they only seem to exacerbate moral hazard problems and regulatory capture by big banks. In place of conventional social science, Taleb argues for a praxis of humility and resilience, embodied in his enthusiasm for heuristics over grand theories: *"Heuristics are simplified rules of thumb that make things simple and easy to implement. But their main advantage is that the user knows that they are not perfect, just expedient, and is therefore less fooled by their powers."*... A heuristic can clearly be wrong in application. But vitally, it makes no claims to have grasped the fundamental mechanics of complex social processes.

The sense is that in the fairly recent past there were social narratives that were both fulfilling and rewarding to participate in, but that for our generation and seemingly subsequent generations to come, it is becoming harder and harder to find and buy into a compelling shared telos... The experience has spurred and will continue to spur discussion of values, policies, and culture—arguments over which beliefs and tenets are importantly right or importantly wrong, and which behaviors we should encourage or discourage. Much of this discussion is futile, because the problem we are facing runs deeper than the question of what to believe or how to behave: it is our very way of determining these things that is broken. We are not undergoing a crisis of culture but rather a crisis of epistemology... Our current historical moment is one where the epistemic approaches that have served well enough to keep our social fabric alive and functional until now are breaking down. We have changed our environment enough that our current ways of understanding what’s going on no longer hold: technology and globalization have changed our information streams and our patterns of life drastically enough that the ways we calibrate around incoming information are becoming increasingly dangerous for us, and this trend will only quicken with time. This is not merely the obsolescence of an understanding of what’s going on, i.e. a world model or a culture; it is the obsolescence of a way of reaching understandings of what is going on, i.e. the foundations of world models and cultures in general... We must go beyond the question of what we should believe or do, to the question of how any of those choices are formed in the first place, because that is where the breakdown is actually happening.

> "Technocratic power has become the core backbone of industrial civilization. Incapable of managing complex modern forms of social organization, legacy political structures have outsourced their responsibilities to an army of credentialed bureaucrats. The abdication of the statesman marks the rise of the expert, a political player who wields a different kind of authority. Where the democratic leader derives his mandate from the supposed will of the people, the expert’s legitimacy comes from his supposedly superior knowledge of technical matters. A product of the meritocratic machine, the expert translates epistemic credibility into influence: He rules because he knows more.
>
> Modern states created expert-led administrations to serve specific, subordinate functions. Certain questions required technical assessments, for which rulers had to employ competent advisers. But the Industrial Revolution expanded the need for this kind of structure far beyond its initial conception. The centralization of private power demanded the centralization of public power.  Faced with ever-expanding firms with clear objectives and coordinated hierarchies, the state found itself dealing with unprecedented legal, administrative, and industrial complexity at scale. Institution-builders restructured state power to deal with these challenges, one step at a time. Once a subordinate extension of conventional authority, technocracy metastasized into a large, independent authority of its own. The statesman-expert hierarchy has become a partnership upon which the functionality of the state depends. Just as the preservation of order in medieval kingdoms required symbiosis between priest and knight, so the preservation of state capacity in industrial societies requires symbiosis between expert and statesman.
>
> Political and technocratic modes of power can no longer operate on their own. Without direction, bureaucracies degenerate into cold-hearted machines that reduce the human experience to a set of metrics devoid of higher purpose. Without structure and expertise, politicians simply cannot manage the social systems of modern life to carry out any particular vision. Both modes, therefore, need each other to thrive and survive. Working in unison, political leaders provide the end to the technocracy’s means and the moral purpose of the machine’s inner workings. Conversely, experts can enlighten the decisions of statesmen, temper their dynamism, and bring detachment to the chaotic whims of the moment. Ultimately, modern, industrial states are faced with this central challenge: to re-establish the primacy of the political over the technocratic without destroying the necessary symbiosis between the two.
>
> Few regimes, if any, have found the right balance. In the West and beyond, political representatives delight in delegating their power to administrators. Two incentives explain this love of abdication: First, outsourcing represents a handy way to avoid policy-making, responsibility, and personal accountability. Second, outsourcing frees up time to fundraise, campaign, and build a media-savvy persona. On the other end of the trade, technocrats welcome their ever-expanding authority by consolidating their status and influence without worrying about elections. Over time, the unchanging administration captures the influence that elected offices once possessed; every time, power flows from the temporary and fragile to the permanent and secure.
>
> This trend results in an unbalanced structure wherein political leaders turn themselves into actors in a televised pantomime while experts, internalizing the hubristic idea that technical skill and statesmanship are one and the same, rule behind the scenes. In theory, this model applies the division of labor to politics. Theatrical players, selected for their charisma, dominate surface-level institutions while technical players, selected for their brute-force competence, control the superstructure. In practice, however, this imbalanced order fuses the worst of both technocracy and mob rule. Unelected, directionless bureaucrats reign supreme while demagogues distract the masses. Devoid of discipline, coherence, and moral purpose, technocrats cannot even deal with strictly technical issues like pandemic management, even as they undermine and absorb the whole political structure.

> "Yan’s first major work, a translation of John Stuart Mill’s 1859 essay “On Liberty,” reveals that freedom of speech is a means to the end of state power. If this point has rarely been noted in Western societies’ ongoing debates about the erosion of free speech, it is because neither liberals nor their opponents are used to thinking about liberalism in such terms. We usually imagine liberalism as reducing or restraining state action, protecting citizens from government, and allowing individuals to pursue their own ends without reference to a common good or shared values... Through Yan’s eyes, we can see liberalism afresh—as a means of producing certain kinds of subjects whose apparently liberated selves serve the interests of the state. As the continued existence of liberal democracy becomes ever less certain, it is of vital interest to liberals to appreciate their own intellectual tradition—and political situation—from Yan’s perspective." - [Yan Fu’s Lessons on the True Mission of Liberalism, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/16/yan-fus-lessons-on-the-true-mission-of-liberalism/)

> "“On Liberty” is ostensibly about the rights of individuals to express their own views and follow their own course of life, against the oppression not only of the state but also of majority opinion. Mill feared official censorship and social intolerance as obstacles to people’s personal happiness. His treatise may seem relevant to contemporary debates about so-called “cancel culture,” but hardly to matters of state power. The genius of Yan, however, was to see past the exterior and into the center of Mill’s thought, where the interests of individual freedom and the state are joined.
>
> Mill argued that freedom of expression is threatened by “men of narrow capacity” who are sure that whatever they believe is not only right, but must be “inculcated, and in many ways acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world.” Such people must be restrained from imposing their views on others, and indeed, must be “forced to listen to both sides” of arguments for and against their views. Freedom of speech, as Mill saw it, is thus not simply a matter of the state stepping back from the regulation of what can be said. Rather, it is a kind of violent intervention by which individuals are transformed against their will from narrow-minded and weak-willed subjects, fearfully attached to their old opinions, into more strong-minded and dynamic ones capable of considering a range of views.
>
> For Mill, politics is the art of producing citizens with certain desirable cognitive capacities and emotional qualities. Any particular policy needs to be justified by its contribution to the “mental education” of citizens and its “strengthening [of] their active faculties.” Mill’s ideal citizen is full of energy and ambition, insistent on developing their own opinions and acting according to their own moral standards. Resolutely individual, such citizens differ greatly from each other—they are each conducting personal experiments in living. But they are not irrational or hedonistic, nor do they merely tolerate each other’s different lifestyles. Instead, they are each able to discipline themselves and critique each other. They listen to reason, both in the sense of bridling their own passions and in the sense of appealing to a higher, super-individual logic as they think to themselves and with others about what they ought to do.
>
> These qualities of mind are crucial, Mill claimed, not only to personal flourishing but to the power of the state. Mill argued that censorship and conventions stifle our “feelings and desires.” But if permitted to express themselves in productive competition, our drives and ambitions would contribute to social progress. Feelings and desires, he insisted, are “another name for energy,” and the task of politics is to incite and harness individual energy for social purposes—not to drain that energy away with clichéd moralisms and socially obligatory routines. Individuals with strong impulses should be allowed to lead their own lifestyles, to express their own ideas, and to disagree vociferously with others. Society needs such “strong natures,” which are “the stuff of which heroes are made,” not only because such independent thinkers are the ones who make contributions to the progress of science, technology, and culture, but also because they possess the virtues necessary for leadership. Capable of making choices and setting standards for their own lives, they have the psychological wherewithal to inspire and govern others.
>
> Thus for Mill, citizens with bad characters threaten this process by imposing their small-minded prejudices through legal or social sanctions which prevent the expression of people’s productive energies. Such narrow-minded citizens must be forcibly restrained and made to become the kind of magnanimous people who can participate in rational, spirited debate and tolerate living alongside those who do not share their views or ways of living. Those with good characters and energy must be helped to become still more virtuous, and even heroic. They must contribute to society’s progress with their ideas and provide leadership in all those fields—from education to the military to politics—in which such energetic, autonomous and responsible personalities are necessary. They must only be limited or restrained where their ambitions start to conflict with the full expression of the productive drive of others to the detriment of the whole. Liberalism, from this point of view, is a series of techniques for restraining bad characters, rewarding good ones, creating productive competition, and teaching citizens how they can be both most authentically individual and usefully social.
>
> Few of Mill’s modern commentators in the West have caught the importance of this point. Perhaps the sharpest observer to have done so is the American philosopher Elijah Millgram. He notes in his 2019 book John Stuart Mill and the Meaning of Life, that Mill argued for liberal “policies and institutional innovations” because of the “effects that they would have on people’s characters.” Liberalism, with its focus on restraints on the state’s interference in people’s private lives, was not as such a means of setting individuals free from social control. Rather, it allowed them to contribute to social and economic progress through the removal of harmful restraints and the transformation of individuals into “strong-willed agents.” Their energies, released from convention and censorship, would also ultimately contribute to the power of the very state from which they had only seemed to be emancipated." - [Yan Fu’s Lessons on the True Mission of Liberalism, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/16/yan-fus-lessons-on-the-true-mission-of-liberalism/)

> "Like Mill, Yan feared that cultural norms and state censorship were holding back individuals from expressing new ideas, experimenting with new ways of living and institutions, and seeing themselves as responsible agents. A culture and state organized on the principle of conformity to static norms, he worried, suppressed people’s dynamism.  It thus suppressed their ability both to contribute to the economic and scientific progress of their society and to constitute themselves as magnanimous, public-spirited citizens. People afraid of officials’ or neighbors’ judgments about their opinions and lifestyles would lead small, narrow, timid lives and never activate their inner energies that might have made their nation stronger. Such people respond to social pressure, Yan warned, “by rejecting their own talents and eventually they have no talents to reject. So the unique talents heaven blessed them with dry up…We follow the common practices throughout our lifetimes and then pass away…To live this way is to lack a self.”
>
> Living in conformity to others’ expectations not only suppresses freedom and happiness, but also the capacity to contribute to society in ways that go beyond established convention. Yan argued that “making myself good and so helping others becoming increasingly good thus depends on morally independent action, as opposed to becoming corrupted by convention.” We should not understand Yan’s understanding of being “good” as the mere following of social rules, which he identified with corrupt conventions; instead, it refers to being good for a range of activities, pursued with the highest possible degree of individual initiative and personal responsibility. Only someone who is good for their own pursuits in such a way can also be good for their society.
>
> Yan presented these concerns in a combination of Darwinian and traditional Chinese discourses that might be jarring for contemporary Western liberals. After describing how an illiberal society ruins personal happiness and prevents people from freely developing their talents, he asked rhetorically whether this was any way for a society “to make itself fit for the struggle for survival, for a person to pursue the True Way by which people should live?”
>
> We are not used to thinking of liberalism as offering individuals a “True Way,” and often see it as based instead on a resolute neutrality or even indifference towards the common good. Yan, however, like Mill, believed that the point of political freedom was to allow people to discover and productively follow their own natures as far as this was consistent with other people doing the same, and that only under such conditions can people lead an authentic moral life, responsible for their own opinions and actions. Developing this internal ethical core of agency is the “True Way.” From this perspective, liberalism is not a refusal to legislate morality, but precisely an effort to compel citizens to pursue a vision of the good, understood as a certain ideal of character." - [Yan Fu’s Lessons on the True Mission of Liberalism, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/16/yan-fus-lessons-on-the-true-mission-of-liberalism/)

> "In a similar spirit, Benjamin Schwartz, a historian of Chinese intellectual history at Harvard, insisted in his pioneering 1964 biography of Yan Fu that the latter’s interpretation of liberalism had the power to shatter our complacent understanding of our own political traditions. When Westerners look outward to the non-Western world, Schwartz noted, we imagine that we are shifting our gaze from the familiar to the foreign. In fact, we hardly know ourselves. We live in a “deceptive clarity” about the “inner meaning of modern Western development.” But insofar as one can even speak of “the West,” this civilization is not so much a coherent entity as a site of contending forces in a dynamic tension.
>
> If the West is, as Schwartz argued, a “vast, ever-changing, highly problematic area of human experience,” then any attempt to understand it is also an intervention in its ongoing transformation. Its history is too extensive and varied to be expressed in any synthesis, however nuanced. This means that any attempt at such a synthesis must emphasize particular elements and neglect others. The choice of what to emphasize and what to neglect in one’s story about what the West is and how it got that way is necessarily a political choice, recognizing and validating some of the West’s possibilities at the expense of alternatives. If we climb to the vantage point of Yan Fu’s writings, it is not so much because his work offers a more objective or comprehensive view of the West in all its complexity, but because it orients our attention to aspects of Western civilization that are particularly useful for the present moment, as the West comes to face an analogous situation to late Qing China. To see oneself with the help of the other is an opportunity both to know oneself and to transform oneself.
>
> From this perspective, the question that liberals such as Mill and Yan have been trying to answer is not, how to protect individuals from the power of the state, but rather how to increase the power of individuals and the state in a dangerous world. The liberalism of the modern West no longer seems to produce the kind of dynamic, independent-minded agents that Mill and Yan expected it to. Indeed, Westerners—and especially young elites in prestigious Western universities—seem increasingly conformist and censorious.
>
> If Mill and Yan are right, such censorious personalities are not capable of competently managing institutions and ensuring social and economic progress in a world full of rival states. The challenge for Western liberals is, with Yan’s help, to reinterpret the sources of our tradition, just as he reinterpreted Confucianism with the help of Mill. With both liberal ideology and institutions in potentially terminal decline, Yan’s words on the Confucian classics apply to the liberal canon as well: we have to use new machines to open them up.
>
> Liberalism’s perennial but long-concealed imperative was to produce virtuous individuals who could contribute both to the good of society and the dynamism of the state, precisely because they are liberated from the censorship and conformity that the latter may impose. Even if the West maintains a firmly liberal self-conception through our coming crisis, it can and should be a liberalism of heroic action unleashed from small-minded censorship and procedural restraint, rather than the inertia that has come to characterize our society, as it did imperial China in its decline. Yan Fu failed in his quest for good government and liberal reform in late Qing China, but he could still succeed in the West." - [Yan Fu’s Lessons on the True Mission of Liberalism, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/02/16/yan-fus-lessons-on-the-true-mission-of-liberalism/)

> "To understand the value of textual analysis for understanding modern China, we must start with a basic reality of Chinese politics: commanding the Communist Party of China is hard. Central authorities must work their will through a sprawling bureaucratic labyrinth. Some 96 million people claim party membership—more than the populations of California, Texas, and Florida combined. Inducing this colossal mass of committees, groups, divisions, and departments to pull in the same direction is the most difficult task facing any General Secretary. One might call the Communist Party of China the world’s largest coordination problem. The central leadership cannot solve this problem without a measure of openness.
>
> Open coordination comes by way of slogan. Central authorities lead the party by condensing their plans, goals, and assessments into slogans designed to ceaselessly cycle through official speeches, party directives, guiding regulations, and daily propaganda. Through this omnipresent whir of words, the leadership instills a shared conceptual vocabulary that individual party cadres can then adapt to their particular circumstances. A tremendous amount can be learned by studying these slogans and the documents that they appear in. Unlike interviews and field surveys, there is little worry that Western analysts will be cut off from these documents. Because they are central to the workings of the party-state, the party apparatus promotes them with feverish intensity." - [Why We Need the Center for Strategic Translation, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/11/14/why-we-need-the-center-for-strategic-translation/)

> "In order to create the kind of environment where a leap of faith on someone is likely to be rewarded, it becomes even more important to enforce the basic norms of justice, truth-telling, and reciprocity, not less so. Among individuals or small groups, people can just leave or be excluded. But on the level of larger communities or societies, this isn’t an option. This means that allowing people to leverage the norms of good faith or mutual support with no intention of reciprocity only serves to establish parasitic norms instead. The members of the community might not be able to leave easily, but they can shift to low-trust expectations of behavior. This puts the community into a death spiral: having burned the stores of high-trust social capital, its members are eventually no longer able to follow the norms required to build them back up again. A newly dead body burns up its last stores of cellular health before the full, visible decay takes hold. When you have functional authority and control over a defined group, it is possible and right to punish parasitic behavior by censuring or removing the people who engage in it. In that case, it becomes easier for those within the group to make their leaps of faith on each other. But you exercise greater courage in the situation in which the Samaritan and the Hebrew found themselves, where no such basis exists. This is the case in which making such leaps is the most risky. But it is also when such leaps can become the basis of a new set of bonds, and a new pattern on which to cooperate and eventually draw in others into a higher order of life." - [The Triumph of the Good Samaritan, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/06/the-triumph-of-the-good-samaritan/)

Modernity tends to resemble something like a nutrient-stripping monoculture crop: it homogenizes cultures, disciplines populations into collective infertility, and extracts the benefits of high IQ, cooperative norms, and other human capital without ever regenerating it. To grow, the little seed must pull material from the surrounding decay into its own superior pattern of life. For your social body, this means people.
>
> ...
>
> Those in the community had judged their leap of faith well, invested in their bonds, and reciprocated each others’ goodwill. Any social body that accepts an outsider is taking a chance that the new person can integrate into the bonds it has established and make them stronger. A truly compelling form of life often brings people in under the power of sheer attraction, drawing in outsiders through its obvious beauty and worth. This makes it even more important that the social body rigorously enforces its own norms on those who enter, reforming or rejecting behaviors that could threaten to undermine it. To transform strangers into valued kin and highly functional members of your social body, parasitism must be ruthlessly punished and excluded." - [The Triumph of the Good Samaritan, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/06/the-triumph-of-the-good-samaritan/)

> "As the world discovered in 2020, perception management only goes so far. If disaster blooms into catastrophe, governing elites focused on panic prevention find their disaster response effort suddenly dependent on the very public they are frightened of. What is needed then is honesty and leadership. Leaders then have no choice but to rely on, assist, and lead the uncoordinated, selfdirected efforts of the masses. What these efforts need to succeed is information and good strategy—and the trust that they will use this information well. The people must be trusted with fear, and the governing class must be comfortable with leadership during times of crisis. Fear is an unpleasant emotion— but at times, a useful one. Fear lends urgency to action. Fear forces the afraid to focus on that which matters. This is the great lesson of the 2020 coronavirus: We should have been allowed to fear. Alas, our leaders feared our fear more than they feared our deaths.

> "Decentralization is generally a debate about centers versus peripheries: holistic, coordinated action versus localized, particular action. Western politics, particularly in America and the Anglosphere, has been crippled for decades by viewing center and periphery as two sides of a factional conflict.
>
> In the realm of economics, markets and the state are consistently seen as two players in a zero-sum game. The dovish version sees the state as a necessary but ultimately corrective force, evening out the playing field; meanwhile, the hawkish version presents a parasitic state draining productive energy from a population just trying to get by. In regional disputes, cities are pitted against towns and rural areas. Growth is seen as necessarily favoring one or the other, and by extension educated urbanites versus ‘Middle America.’ In debates about social mores, the notion of common customs which shape the population is all but nonexistent. Debates center on the boundary between private freedom versus public restriction—whether drug use, owning firearms, sexual norms, or religious praxis.
>
> The presumption of a zero-sum game is a fundamental error in nearly every one of these discourses. America’s greatest innovations were achieved by dynamic interaction between state power and market potential. Investment and coordination by the military, health, and research agencies like DARPA brought us GPS, numerous pharmaceutical drugs, the internet, and the Google algorithm...
>
> The cases are diverse, but the lesson is the same: center and periphery, when properly governed, interact symbiotically in a feedback loop. The health and development of the center feeds that of the periphery, and vice-versa. Good statecraft must use the strength of each simultaneously. It must recognize the dance between center and periphery, and consider both as components of a unified and dynamic whole." - [Only the State Can Succeed at Decentralization, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/11/only-the-state-can-succeed-at-decentralization/)

> "Successful decentralization isn’t rebellion and fracture; it’s a constructive cooperation between central and peripheral powers within a holistic order. Centralized and decentralized actions solve different problems: scale and coordination on the one side, experimentation and localized knowledge on the other. This is a much better model for successful institution building." - [Only the State Can Succeed at Decentralization, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/11/only-the-state-can-succeed-at-decentralization/)

> "The core competencies of central action include coordination and scale. When action among a number of local actors is obstructed by insufficient capacity, information, competing interests, or other barriers, it can become more efficient for a central actor to coordinate local actors. Sometimes, it may even override them completely. Where local incentives compete with the common good, it provides a rational center for action where none would otherwise exist.
>
> On the other hand, over-extension is often the cause of failure. A classic example is the calculation problem; the necessary knowledge for economic planning is sometimes dispersed among many local actors but inaccessible to a single central actor. Central actors can also find themselves over-applying a particular solution beyond its original context, so that it begins to create more problems than it solved. They can lose the expertise necessary for maintaining previously successful solutions, or fail to keep track of whether the local conditions for a previous solution have continued to hold.
>
> One good example is bureaucracies: a common failure mode for a bureaucracy is that it becomes inefficient in solving the problem which it was formally created to solve, or that it loses the organizational owner who was able to direct it. However, this should not lead one to assume that a central actor as such is the problem. Modern American governing institutions are infamously plagued by ineffective bureaucracies. But Americans have also built effective bureaucracies and can observe effective bureaucracies in other countries today—ones that achieve their goals and are effectively managed by their owners. Forgetting how to cure a disease is bad, but assuming this means there can be no cure is much worse.
>
> Likewise, peripheries are the scene of localized knowledge and coordination. A multiplicity of actors is often more resilient to failure. On a localized level, people can experiment, act on unique knowledge, and improve on what they learn from others. When properly stewarded, they provide an optimal level of variability to the system as a whole—one which keeps it dynamic and resilient. However, failures in coordination, scale, or information can become insurmountable without recourse to a higherlevel actor.
>
> In a healthy positive feedback loop, the center and periphery each act on their strengths. The competency of the center benefits the periphery, while the competency of the periphery achieves the goals which the center cannot. This is a functional order: each part plays its role in a system according to an overall logic. It operates teleologically, with the internal structures evolving as is necessary to fulfill the overall system’s goals. When it comes to a state governing a country, the goal is peace, law, strong social institutions, economic wealth, and so on.
>
> As a general principle, this seems basic. As a guiding force of American governance, it has been thoroughly abandoned and memory-holed. The last remnants of the American System were abandoned in the early 20th century. By the turn of the century, the notion of a state which actively developed and stewarded the country had its new home in Beijing.
>
> When the ability to govern—or even conceive of—a country as a holistic system disappears, the political incentive is for factions to arise. Polities tend to disintegrate from the top down. This is the situation we are struck with in America. Various factions of middlemen and rentiers, who have lost the ability to coordinate around the guiding logic of a holistic center, expropriate the productive health of the peripheries.
>
> Reconciliation is only established through victory by a faction animated by the holistic logic of a new governing center, or collapse and foreign conquest. Victory of a faction operating on mere factional logic only accelerates the problem as they use it as a looting opportunity.
>
> A reconsolidating victory can come from the center or periphery. The American colonies won a peripheral victory against the British center, and the resultant republic won a central victory against its southern periphery during the Civil War. China, now a decisive center, was an exploited periphery for much of its recent history.
>
> Human nature plays a formative role in the tribal dynamics which so often occur when these systems collapse. But that same human nature drives cooperation and invention when things are arranged properly. That makes the symbiotic feedback loop approach to centers and peripheries a powerful mindset for states to have. Each allows humans to cooperate in a uniquely advantageous way. A stewardship approach allows states to responsibly order and govern these systems, and consider them holistically rather than as mere units of tribalized political warfare. Decentralization is often an effective tool to route around and supplant failed institutions or obstructive mid-level political actors. But that efficacy is determined by how well it serves the overarching goals of the country." - [Only the State Can Succeed at Decentralization, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/11/only-the-state-can-succeed-at-decentralization/)

If such a huge drop in economic activity can be papered over with government and private sector intervention, can we imagine how many crucial slower-moving changes are going unnoticed? If our actual wealth per capita, say, has been declining 1% per year for the last 20 years, how would we even know? Civilizational collapse happens on similar or even slower time scales—even though coronavirus hasn’t left everything in flames, we may still be on the long road to collapse. Absent reform, I think we are in for a slow century of decline starting in about 2030 or so.

America is, for now, in an unavoidable period of relative decline, and in 2030 or 2040 the largest economy in the world will almost certainly be that of China. But absolute decline is reversible—2060 is still an open question. A deep pragmatism runs through this country, and if reimagined, the 21st century could see another explosion in American economic, social, and cultural development.

> First, institutions cultivated a sense of public kinship and brotherhood, sometimes formalized by sacred oaths. Just as citizens took oaths to the republic or upon the Bible, social and political associations took their bonds of loyalty no less seriously. The fraternities, federations, and even political parties that these men belonged to embraced extravagant rituals, parades, and performances designed to build fraternal feeling among their members while reminding them of their public responsibilities. They required earnest oaths that committed their members to a life of charity, public service, brotherhood, and the betterment of their fellow men.

Formally drafting charters and bylaws, electing officers, and holding meetings by strict procedures seems like busy work to those accustomed to weak associational ties. But the formality of such associations expressed commitment to the cause and clarified the relationships and responsibilities needed for effective action.

This also ensures that the leadership actually understands the populace. Restraining the message would deprive the literate establishment of the means to understanding the sentiments of its post-literate populace or to gauging the depth of their discontent in times of unrest: it would merely invite more intense tribal outbursts later on.

As Joe Studwell argues in How Asia Works, Singapore is not a useful case study, because free-market policies work unusually well for city-states that prosper through trade and finance. Hong Kong is also a bad case study, for the same reasons. If you have a port, and if your port is close to a growing industrial powerhouse, you don’t have to plan ahead as much; you just have to avoid making any catastrophic mistakes. Singapore did exactly that; thanks to their government’s policies, they’re a lot richer than they otherwise would have been. But they’d still counterfactually be pretty rich, just by virtue of how much cargo and capital passes through their general vicinity.

> Singapore’s position as a port city in the general vicinity of several rapidly industrializing countries meant that it could pursue truly laissez-faire policies and expect good results. Of course, the state intervened heavily in Singapore—it’s odd that such a capitalist paradise has most of its citizens living in government housing. But Singapore is an order of magnitude less economically intrusive than the other case studies." - [Lessons From the East Asian Economic Miracle, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/07/05/lessons-from-the-east-asian-economic-miracle/)

> "China is also hard to analyze because the anti-capitalist faction won their civil war and capitalism only came back once those winners finally died. While their policies from the 1980s onward show a substantial amount of foresight, they didn’t need quite as much as Korea or Japan, because those countries had already done the hard work. Japan had to adopt ideas from 19th-century neo-mercantilists and Korea had to adapt them, but China just had to look at what had worked over the previous decades and do it at scale.
>
> China also benefited from a rising tide of globalization. Their economic growth really kicked into high gear once they joined the WTO, especially since they were willing to drag their feet on issues like IP theft and protection. More so than the other cases, China managed to implement a system of free trade for thee and protectionism for me, and use it to achieve impressively dominant scale in industries with economies of scale. Their plan seems to be to keep on doing this, with more and more industries, unless someone stops them.
>
> China did not just benefit from globalization as an abstract force: it was the direct beneficiary of growth in the other countries discussed above. When Japan started exporting manufactured goods, its cheap labor and low capital made it a good place to make things like shoes and toys—American toy companies were outsourcing some production to Japan in the 1930s. But as the country became more prosperous, wages rose, and those low value-added manufacturers were priced out of Japan.
>
> At first, some of them moved production to places like Taiwan. But later on, Taiwan, too, became too expensive a labor market—one Taiwanese company started out making cheap tennis rackets, expanded into carbon fiber-based tennis rackets, and eventually got out of the sporting goods business to focus on aerospace components, also made out of carbon fiber. So, production moved to China. And unlike the other countries profiled, China was both vast and even more economically under-developed—under Mao, it became one of the rare countries to get more rural over time, as people fled cities. This created an abundant labor supply that could meet any demand; China’s post-famine baby boom ensured that labor supply peaked right around the time when other countries were most desperate to outsource production to cheaper places." - [Lessons From the East Asian Economic Miracle, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/07/05/lessons-from-the-east-asian-economic-miracle/)

> "One way to look at export subsidies is that, like in The Producers, they let a company sell more than 100% of its equity. In this case, the government is essentially “short” the exporter’s profits, and distributes the corresponding long position to the company’s management and the banks that finance its expansion. By ensuring that the people with a stake in the outcome are the ones who can make a better outcome happen, they align incentives towards growth.
>
> This is a centralized, government-based riff on exactly the same logic as venture capital. Venture capital also provides bridge financing to subsidize some behavior that’s unprofitable at small scale but very valuable at a larger scale—export discipline from MITI is economically equivalent to VCs who will fund a negative cash-flow business as long as it has high gross margins, low user churn, and network effects.
>
> There are a surprising number of parallels between these policies and the way startups work:
>
> - Startups often sell to other startups at first. Salesforce did this in a big way; Y Combinator is a sort of Zaibatsu that gives startups instant access to a few hundred good customers.

>
> - There’s no immediate need to turn a profit, but there is an intense need to show growth. A startup that gets valued at 30x sales in one round and 5x sales at IPO has a similar cadence of external cash flows to a steel company that starts out getting 50% of its revenues from export subsidies and matures with 95% of its revenues from real customers." - [Lessons From the East Asian Economic Miracle, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/07/05/lessons-from-the-east-asian-economic-miracle/)

We forget the extent of our own power and start blaming an ephemeral elite beyond ourselves for the ills of society. And when something does need to be challenged in elite thought, not in the fake, recuperated way that Greta Thunberg ritually challenges an already-supportive crowd at Davos, but in the real way that carries personal risk—we bail. When we see an unfashionable truth that may risk criticism or ostracism, we forget our own position of strength and assume we cannot bear those risks.

Perhaps you would be on call longer. Or perhaps you would be sent to negotiate with hostile neighbors. With greater consumption and ability comes greater responsibility. You don’t need any grand theory of legitimacy to see how this works—this responsibility simply emerges from the rules of interpersonal politics. From the rules of cause and effect. If you do not pull your weight, if you do not prove that your greater consumption is serving some purpose—that with your higher consumption and ability you are doing some good, you better watch your back.

The greater capacity for violence and power gives you more control over, and more stake in, the fate of your tribe. You do the work of leadership because that is your unique niche in the social order. If you don’t pull your weight and lead, your investments within the tribe would start to lose their value. The things you care about would cease to exist—first gradually, then all at once when your people face threat by nature and rivals.

But they dare not lay the blame at their own feet, caused by their own overreaches and dysfunction. Anyone who did would immediately be under suspicion. No longer one of us, but one of them. So, those who might otherwise lead the difficult but necessary elite self-critique instead keep their mouths shut, or they say the wrong thing without ideological, psychological, and social preparation for the consequences and get cast out. Only the true believers incapable of self-critique, the incompetent, and the cynics, remain as voices in the public forum. They talk in circles, never quite able to correct course and come to any new conclusions, except the need to double down on current ideological practices.

This creates an atmosphere of impotence and guilt that contributes to rich young people pretending to be broke to escape that responsibility.

> "The most important fact is this: Yale is a school that sets the standards for other universities. When and where Yale goes, everything else goes, too. Its curricula and administrative policies have a disproportionate effect on the standards for excellence not just for universities, but for industry. Yale psychology undergraduates become Princeton psychology professors, join the American Psychological Association, and determine which conditions get covered by insurance policies. Art students go on to join the National Endowment for the Arts and decide which projects deserve funding. A single idea from a single professor at Yale Law can determine how a future justice chooses to vote when she joins the Supreme Court. “Why is Yale in the news so much?” “Why do people care about Yale’s tiny controversies?” “Why do alumni care about what happens? They’re gone. It’s not their Yale anymore.” These are questions that people ask me often. These questions show a misunderstanding of what Yale is and its role in society. Every once in a while, the staff and editors of the Yale Daily News ask these questions. “Why are people so critical of us? If you don’t like what we print, you have every chance to join the News Team and write for us yourself.” They forget one thing. The Yale Daily News is reprinted by national newspapers. The Yale Daily News has a history of getting students suspended, and even faculty fired. But the Yale Daily News is not accountable to anybody. There are no faculty advisors. They are completely independent, and yet have disproportionate power—not just for a student organization, but for any organization at all. That it is a student organization just makes it even more incredible. This lack of self-consciousness brings us back to the phenomenon I first saw among so many “broke” rich kids. The same vacuum of awareness crops up again and again, influencing both people and institutions, until they are unable to even grasp the potential of their position. Without doing that, rebuilding a shared set of goals around which to coordinate on a large scale will remain impossible. Yale is supposed to be using its power and reputation to set standards for excellence, but instead it is abandoning its responsibilities and getting embroiled in controversy after controversy. Yale is not special in this regard—other colleges are also often embroiled in controversies. But the controversies of top colleges matter most because they determine what is acceptable for everybody else. And what’s happening at Yale reflects a crisis in America’s broader governing class. Unable to effectively respond to the challenges facing them, they instead try to bail out of their own class. The result is an ideology which acts as an escape raft, allowing some of the most privileged young people in the country to present themselves as devoid of power. Institutions like Yale, once meant to direct people in how to use their position for the greater good, are systematically undermined—a vicious cycle which ultimately erodes the country as a whole. Segments of this class engage in risk-averse managerialism, while others take advantage of the glut to disrupt things and expand personal power. The broader population becomes caught up in these conflicts as these actors attempt to build power bases and mobilize against each other. And like Yale, it seems a safe bet that things will continue and even accelerate until some new vision and stable, non-ideological set of coordination mechanisms are able to establish hegemony and become a new ground for real cooperation." - [The Real Problem at Yale Is Not Free Speech, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/08/05/the-real-problem-at-yale-is-not-free-speech/)

Their graduates should overwhelmingly be the confident leaders with a strong sense of noblesse oblige that they claim to produce. Yet the lack of meaningful guidance and substantive vision, the insular bubble students live in, and the nudges towards marginal optimization kill innovative, interesting, and socially beneficial ambition.

We’re naive and uncertain about our own futures, so we go for the school-validated options. Companies exploit this psychology to the fullest.

We learn to bias towards leveraging what we have done in the past, instead of creating a new and better future.

> "Most people are not born with fully-formed visions of what paths in life they should pursue. Instead, we observe cues of affirmation from those around us which mark out some choices as particularly desirable: praise, respect, reward, encouragement, and prestige. We observe these cues throughout our lives, beginning with our parents. These cues tell us which people should be imitated and which paths in life are worthy of effort and sacrifice. They communicate that a particular choice has social sanction. A particular career, social circle, class, or subculture is usually defined by its very strong norms of what is or is not sanctioned. People in those domains must follow these norms to be accepted and well-regarded—in other words, they must follow particular social scripts that mark them out as insiders to the group.
>
> Sanction doesn’t come out of nowhere: it is consciously granted and regulated by those with authority. For example, the Unionist reporter Henry Raymond and banker George Jones co-founded The New York Times with the editorial strategy of using an objective and authoritative journalistic voice. Their goal was to counteract scandal-driven yellow journalism by creating an institution that could sanction what was or wasn’t legitimate news. When either explicit or implicit cues come from an authority figure—a parent, a teacher, an accomplished person, or a political leader—they carry inherent weight. When speaking with peers, we often appeal to such authorities to defend our choices. When we praise, encourage, or condemn a choice, we are often giving a cue that it does or does not possess sanction. Either we are in a place to grant sanction ourselves, or else we are propagating cues that originate with some external authority.

Nearly all of its major institutions are essentially conglomerates of competing organizations. Nominally serving the ends of their parent institution, these organizations are utterly disinterested in whatever higher goals originally guided the structure—or even opposed to them. Military decisions serve private contractors, universities are in thrall to administrative bureaucracies, and big business pours money into consulting fees and marketing campaigns. The condition of the American state merely reflects this broader reality. There are countless dead plans weighing down the place, but precious few living ones. Life in a maze of dead plans conditions entire populations into mediocrity. In a stagnant society, human skill and ambition are wasted on capturing rents or jobs that merely maintain the core structures, as well as on guarding whatever little patch they carve out in a zero-sum world. Risk is a luxury they cannot afford. In a dynamic one, they invest those talents in society’s growth and progress. When people have the sense of purpose that lets them take risks, and the ability to competently carry out a plan, the world stops being zero-sum.

The nature of plans is that they depend on contextual and often non-transferable knowledge and relationships.

The breadth of what an institution can plan is dependent on its core competencies. But statecraft itself is made up of sets of core competencies.

> "Michael Doyle’s recent expression of LDP theory in the article “Three Pillars of the Liberal Peace” stands out as a careful explication of the causal logic underlying LDP theory.
>
> For Doyle, there are three mechanisms at play, all of which must be in operation simultaneously to generate the peace. The first mechanism is that LD states are accountable to voters, especially the median voter. As such, these states “preclude monarchs or dictators turning their potentially aggressive interests into public policy while assuming that the costs will be borne by a subordinate public.”
>
> The second mechanism is that liberal principles or norms entail respect for legitimate individual rights, which are externalized in foreign policy. As Doyle puts it, “Domestically just republics…presume foreign republics to be also consensual, just, and therefore deserving of the accommodation that the individuals that compose them deserve.” The free press in liberal democratic states also helps to hold officials accountable to liberal principles.
>
> The third mechanism is that commerce between liberal democratic states binds them together in a way that strongly discourages war.
>
> The first mechanism of accountability assumes that voters pay close attention to war, don’t like war, and can’t be manipulated into bearing the costs of war. These assumptions seem implausible when examining America’s track record over just the last two decades. Yemen, as just one example out of countless, probably does not even register as a country to the median voter. The U.S. is currently at war in at least seven different countries.
>
> The first mechanism also assumes voters who are able to accurately assess the success or failure of policies, accurately assign responsibility for success or failure, and then electorally reward or punish elites. This concept is known as retrospective voting. In retrospective voting, voters cast ballots based on results, not policies. Outcomes, so it goes, function as a heuristic for voters to rely on to overcome policy ignorance and compel liberal to act beneficially.
>
> But in a 2013 study, Bryan Caplan et al. determined that voters systematically overestimate the influence of politicians on the economy and systematically underestimate their influence on education and the federal budget. The prognosis for retrospective voting is grim: “As long as ignorant and irrational voters know enough to properly reward success and punish failure, democracy can still work well. Unfortunately, retrospective voting requires a largely undefended assumption: Voters’ beliefs about political influence are unbiased.” That is, voters overestimate, underestimate, and misallocate influence.
>
> Numerous other studies have examined voters’ strange propensity to vote out incumbents based on bad circumstances out of incumbents’ control. One such study found that voters punished U.S. governors in oil-producing states based on fluctuating world oil prices. Another determined that the success or failure of incumbent politicians in Latin America was based on U.S. interest rates, in addition to international commodity prices. Voters also consistently punish incumbents for droughts and floods.
>
> While the above work undermines retrospective voting in the abstract, Sebastian Rosato looked specifically at voter behavior in the context of lost wars and found that both liberal democratic and autocratic leaders have similar chances of being removed from power for losing wars, but not a single one of the liberal democratic leaders was actually punished. In contrast, 29 percent of autocratic leaders were either killed, imprisoned, or exiled. For wars that are costly, but not lost, that is, wars where there is one fatality per 2,000 population, autocrats were removed from power 35 percent of the time. They were also punished in 27 percent of cases. Democratic leaders, on the other hand, get off a lot easier, and were only removed 27 percent of the time and punished in just 7 percent of cases. Such findings cast doubt on the first pillar for explaining the peace.
>
> The second pillar focuses on the externalization of liberal democratic norms and principles to the international arena via media publicity and other avenues, which causes liberal democratic states to treat other liberal democratic states with trust and respect, even in cases where there are serious clashes of interests.
>
> But norm externalization has not applied in crucial cases. In a 1994 paper, Christopher Layne used process-tracing to determine that liberal norms and principles did not explain any part of why near-miss wars did not occur between the United States and Britain in 1861, France and Great Britain in 1898, and France and Germany in 1923, as public opinion was not pacific and elites did not refrain from making threats, among other indicators.
>
> Additionally, if liberal democratic norms operate internationally to prevent conflict, a fortiori they should operate domestically. But according to Håvard Hegre, once GDP per capita is controlled for, it turns out that democratic states are no less likely to suffer from internal conflict, compared to autocracies. The historical record also indicates that the U.S. aggressively intervened in democracies and subsequently installed autocratic regimes. Several recent and notable interventions were: Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Indonesia in 1957, British Guyana in 1961, Brazil in 1961 and 1964, Chile in 1973, and Nicaragua in 1984.
>
> Doyle’s response is two-fold: first, the democracies weren’t democratic enough or weren’t fully liberal democratic states, and second, these U.S. interventions were covert, meaning that elites subverted a crucial liberal democratic mechanism.
>
> The first response could arguably apply to Iran, Indonesia, and Nicaragua, which at the time were quite immature democracies, but certainly the regimes at the time were more democratic than previous regimes. The other states, however, were much more democratic.
>
> The second response about covert action misses the point. If the mechanisms to explain such an outcome do not work as described in even a small number of cases, so much the worse for the mechanisms. Appeal to covert action to save the mechanism is simply an admission of its limited explanatory power.
>
> The third and final pillar concerns the claim of conflict-reducing interdependencies between nations caused by trade, but even if this is true —and the literature is mixed on this point—trade is not exclusive to liberalism. And the argument that free trade specifically is necessary for this mechanism to work is 1) putting an enormous amount of stock in the difference between “free” and “unfree” trade, and 2) missing the point that free trade may be best understood here as a proxy either for liberal democratic states in the same military alliance or for the relationship between a liberal democratic state and a small vassal state, in which no military conflict is necessary to achieve desired economic domination.
>
> For Doyle, the underlying mechanisms must always be in play for LDP theory to work. But this position is dangerously close to a tautology, as the second mechanism holds that liberal democratic states’ liberal principles of respect, trust, and the recognition of legitimate individual rights are externalized in its foreign policy. What this effectively translates to is that it necessarily has to be the case that liberal democratic states treat other liberal democratic states with respect and trust for there to be a low likelihood of war, which is uninformative.
>
> If the causal logic of these mechanisms is broken, or if there are numerous historical case studies in which these mechanisms actually do not prevent war or explain near-misses between liberal democratic states, then other candidate mechanisms should be explored to explain the democratic peace.
>
> One way of trying to answer the question of what best explains the lack of war in Europe and North America is to imagine hypothetical scenarios from the perspective of elite decision-makers in a dyad and come up with plausible conditions under which war might emerge. What conditions would have to obtain in the current geopolitical environment for Germany to go to war with France, or England to go to war with France, or Germany to go to war with Greece, etc.? Let’s start with the last hypothetical, although it will sound odd because war in Western Europe is almost inconceivable in the post-World War II environment. But imagine we broaden the circle and German decision-makers become so incensed with Greece’s lack of fiscal continence that Germany decides to invade Greece. First, Germany’s military is currently not capable of launching and sustaining a land or air war in Europe. Second, both Germany and Greece belong to the same U.S.-engineered military alliance, NATO, and so other NATO member states would be obliged to defend Greece. Third, in order to get to the point where the proposal of war in this instance would even be on the table, the German state would have to be filled with—and German voters would have to vote for—an entirely new elite dominated by an entirely new and aggressive way of thinking. The United States engineered the post-World War II environment specifically to ensure this does not occur, and continually maintains this environment with both hard and soft power—the former via its enduring military presence on the continent and the latter via diplomatic censure and its many U.S.-funded or coordinated non-governmental organizations. Replace Greece in this example with France, and an additional point of consideration appears: France has nuclear weapons. For any other conceivable dyad, many or most of these considerations will also apply, and none have any strong relationship with liberal principles or mechanisms, with the exception in this case of the liberal character of the German elite. However, this of course is due to the fact that a large part of Germany was a U.S. vassal state immediately after 1945 and still maintains much of that character as a militarily and diplomatically-occupied country. It would be a mistake to think of foreign policy decision-makers as purely motivated by power, just like it would be a mistake to conceive of them as purely utility maximizers. Humans in general are motivated by a multiplicity of goods and possess a certain baseline level of sociability. But the claim is that the motivations of sociability for peace are downstream of identity relations, and identity relations in the post-1945 era emphatically were constructed as part of Pax Americana, the new, U.S.-led order. Moreover, due to the way sovereignty is de facto distributed in the post-World War II environment, Germany is not quite the right unit for war  is part of an arguably post-national order. While Germany is technically considered to be a sovereign state, the idea of it practically exercising this sovereignty to invade Greece and get away with it is not very plausible. The long arm of the U.S., NATO, the European Union, and the United Nations would put a stop to such a move. The more appropriate unit for war is more like NATO versus a rogue liberal democratic state or a rogue NATO member state—perhaps Turkey. If NATO did in fact go to war against its member state Turkey, democratic peace theorists might claim that this is no way counts as a point against their thesis. After all, Turkey isn’t exactly a shining example of liberal democracy. But what they’re missing is that regime character is downstream of power relations and historical processes. In the West, liberal democracy is the only game in town, and the extent to which other countries have adopted liberal democracy is a reliable indicator of the extent to which they have become integrated into the U.S.-dominated geopolitical order. The process of “becoming liberal,” in other words, is virtually indistinguishable historically from “integration into the U.S.-dominated geopolitical order.” And integration has not been a passive process. Non-democracies, as Christopher Hobson has noted, have historically been labeled threatening, both behaviorally and ontologically by the West. In what almost follows naturally from this labeling process, the West has taken upon itself to employ coercive democratization or sanctions to subordinate recalcitrant polities, often resulting in worse developmental indicators in these countries, which again reinforces the superiority of liberal democracies over other competing systems. We can see this process currently at play in Iraq, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, among many others. Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of examining a parallel universe identical to ours with the exception that geopolitical historical processes have no impact on regime character, such that it can be observed that states adopt liberal democracy in a vacuum and then exhibit the democratic peace among one another. In other words, we have a problem of collinearity. Still, that doesn’t mean a case for LDP can’t be made in the actual world. However, there are few convincing case studies of countries adopting liberal democracy in the absence of other pacifying factors, such as power relations during the Cold War, in which countries either sorted themselves or were sorted into blocs based on alliance with the Western order or the Soviet order. The world order is changing. Liberal democratic peace theory is slowly losing relevance. Liberal evangelism feels passé, given recent regime change failures in the Middle East and North Africa, and backsliding in Eastern Europe. Theorists may soon have to confront the possibility that liberal democratic regimes, rather than demonstrating intrinsic benefits of liberalism, are little more than the preferred regime-type of Pax Americana." - [The Rise and Fall of Liberal Democratic Peace Theory, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2018/10/15/the-rise-and-fall-of-liberal-democratic-peace-theory/)



> "The ability to ascertain the truth, and refer to the truth with legitimacy, is fundamental to the functionality of a civilization’s institutions and people. The more closely social status corresponds to activity that’s ultimately beneficial for society, the more such activity is incentivized, much more strongly than by even a large financial reward. Wisely distributing status makes the difference between a world where most kids dream of becoming YouTubers and one where they dream of taking us to space." - [Science Needs Sovereigns, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/03/science-needs-sovereigns/)

> "The dreams of automating scientific progress with vast and well-funded bureaucracies have evidently failed. This is because bureaucracies are only as dynamic as the live players who pilot them. Without a live player at the helm who is a powerful individual in control of the bureaucracy, the existing distribution of legitimacy is just frozen in place, and more funding works only to keep it more frozen rather than to drive scientific progress forward. Powerful individuals will not always make the right bets on crazy new ideas and the crazy people who come up with them, but individuals have a chance to make the right bets, whereas bureaucracies can only pretend to make them. Outsourcing science to vast and well-funded bureaucracies then gives us the impression of intense work on the cutting edge of science, but without any of the substance. The solution is not just to grant more funding and legitimacy to individual scientists rather than scientific bureaucracies, but to remind powerful individuals, and especially those with sovereign authority, that if they don’t grant this legitimacy, no one else will. Science lives or dies on personal endorsement by powerful patrons. Only the most powerful individuals in society can afford to endorse the right immature and speculative ideas, which is where all good ideas begin their life cycle." - [Science Needs Sovereigns, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/03/science-needs-sovereigns/)

Don’t hold me to that.” If you don’t force me to give you my conviction levels, I prefer not to because you have less grounds to dismiss me when I turn out to be a loser. So no one’s going to do it for free, they’ve got to be forced to do it. Do our voters have enough attention span that, a year or two later, they’ll remember “Hey, what did he say when he was campaigning?” Or “When the Secretary of Defense told us the Afghan government would last easily over a year, was it high conviction or low conviction when he told us that?” So of course, if I’m the SecDef, I’d rather get to say “Oh, I was getting out of the office and you know, they didn’t ask me whether it was high or low conviction on my way out.” So when it turns out that it’s only four weeks instead of a year, I won’t get in trouble because I will just say “Well, we didn’t really know.” People are going to resist meritocracy and keeping a careful score." - [Political Academia With Stephen Hsu, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/12/12/political-academia-with-stephen-hsu/)

Often, they or their predecessors were in on the formation of the current regime of society, and they are themselves steeped in the animating philosophy or religion of that regime.

They must continually be willing to prove this through self-sacrifice—of leisure, of effort, and if necessary, of life—for that faith and for their fellow society-members who are lower down the spectrum. From this comes both their own self-confidence and the respect, honor, and obedience of their followers and subjects.

Of course, if they manage to prevent this overthrow without returning to their natural duties as a ruling class, their society as a whole will fall apart or transform into something radically different—whether through internal convulsion or invasion from outside.

Keynes repeatedly species that his theory is not concerned with technological development and focuses only on maintaining full employment assuming a static technology level. His theory’s recommendations do indeed help towards that goal.

> However, the reason we are prosperous today is not because our forefathers maintained full employment. We are prosperous today because our forefathers developed and deployed better and better technology—cars, antibiotics, forge presses, container ships, cryogenic storage to transport liqueed natural gas, and thousands more. A society with full employment and the technology that existed in Keynes’s lifetime is vastly poorer than a society with high unemployment and today’s technology. Very few people would prefer being gainfully employed in the boom years of the late 19th century Gilded Age over struggling to nd work in a sluggish 2020s economy—say, in Canada or Portugal." - [Industrial Greatness Requires Economic Depressions, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2025/02/21/industrial-greatness-requires-economic-depressions/)

> "Individuals routinely use legitimacy as a shortcut for evaluating the quality of the ideas around them. What may intuitively feel like evaluating an idea on its merits has oftentimes already factored in how an idea is communicated, and who is communicating it. We do this because it is harder for us to assess claims in fields that are outside our areas of expertise and so, instead, we learn from experience which sources to rely on. Evaluating an idea’s intellectual legitimacy is often safer and easier than evaluating the idea itself, and in a healthy society, the shortcut works. This makes the shortcut an efficient and effective heuristic for individuals. Even then, though, an intellectually valid idea that is correctly perceived as legitimate might ultimately still turn out to be false... This shortcut is so common we could argue that intellectual legitimacy is one of the foundations of power in our society." - [Intellectual Legitimacy, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/intellectual-legitimacy/)

> "How can intellectual legitimacy grow detached from truth or intellectual validity? Society’s perception of legitimacy can be incorrect, sometimes even when available information easily disproves views still held to be legitimate. This is because perception is outsourced to various authorities—sometimes independently prominent individuals, but most commonly to institutions and those acting as their representatives. It takes live players or practitioners of living traditions of knowledge to orient such institutions towards the truth. Incentives inside of old, automated organizations are at best weakly coupled to truth, and at times actively push against it. What do such incentives look like in practice?

Even if the manager has learned that the second applicant is more qualified for the job, in many workplaces it would be more prudent for the manager to choose the first applicant. If the manager passes up the first applicant in favor of the second, but the second underperforms, it is the manager who is in trouble for a poor hiring decision. But if the first candidate underperforms, the manager has an excuse: they trusted the Harvard degree!  Whether it was the correct choice or not, the manager’s hiring decision will not be seen as impulsive or irresponsible.

Physicists, however, do not have intellectual authority on the topic of how society should be run. Economists do. The intellectual legitimacy of an idea partially depends on whether it is proposed by someone with intellectual authority. Intellectual authority is a personal reputation. It reflects not only perceived expertise, but perceived pro-social orientation of the individual. Intellectual authority rests with people who are seen as possessing good intellectual judgement that is not only technically correct, but also takes into account social and political factors." - [Intellectual Authority, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/intellectual-authority/#:~:text=While%20working%20as,and%20political%20factors.)

> "The intellectual legitimacy of ideas is partially determined by who communicates them. The messenger matters for the reputation of an idea. Often those with the highest intellectual authority aren’t necessarily the most generative. As a consequence, credit for originating a legitimized idea nearly always flows to the person with the highest intellectual authority that has a claim to it... Generativity, validation, and authority can be aligned through functional institutions, although this is an exceptional rather than ordinary state of affairs. Different social roles hold different amounts of intellectual authority. The academic has more intellectual authority than the journalist, who in turn has more authority than the blogger... The intellectual authority of these different social roles themselves can change over time. In this way such roles are an example of borrowed power: one can use one’s socially legible role to legitimate one’s ideas, but at the end of the day one’s social role is contingent on a broader social landscape that is prone to change... The intellectual authority of a role changes with success or failure at social, economic, and political competition between niches. Legible intellectual successes can change the authority of a social role as well. A good example of this is 20th century physics. The triumphs of theories such as general relativity and quantum mechanics greatly enhanced the intellectual authority of the profession." - [Intellectual Authority, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/intellectual-authority/)

> “Parameters” in systems jargon means the numbers that determine how much of a discrepancy turns which faucet how fast... Putting different hands on the faucets may change the rate at which the faucets turn, but if they’re the same old faucets, plumbed into the same old system, turned according to the same old information and goals and rules, the system isn’t going to change much. Electing Bill Clinton was definitely different from electing George Bush, but not all that different, given that every president is plugged into the same political system. (Changing the way money flows in that system would make much more of a difference — but I’m getting ahead of myself on this list.) Parameters are dead last on my list of powerful interventions. Diddling with the details, arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic. Probably 90, no 95, no 99 percent of our attention goes to parameters, but there’s not a lot of leverage in them. Not that parameters aren’t important — they can be, especially in the short term and to the individual who’s standing directly in the flow. People care deeply about parameters and fight fierce battles over them. But they RARELY CHANGE BEHAVIOR. If the system is chronically stagnant, parameter changes rarely kick-start it. If it’s wildly variable, they don’t usually stabilize it. If it’s growing out of control, they don’t brake it. Whatever cap we put on campaign contributions, it doesn’t clean up politics. The Feds fiddling with the interest rate haven’t made business cycles go away. (We always forget that during upturns, and are shocked, shocked by the downturns.) After decades of the strictest air pollution standards in the world, Los Angeles air is less dirty, but it isn’t clean. Spending more on police doesn’t make crime go away. Since I’m about to get into some examples where parameters ARE leverage points, let me stick in a big caveat here. Parameters become leverage points when they go into ranges that kick off one of the items higher on this list. Interest rates, for example, or birth rates, control the gains around positive feedback loops. System goals are parameters that can make big differences. Sometimes a system gets onto a chaotic edge, where the tiniest change in a number can drive it from order to what appears to be wild disorder. These critical numbers are not nearly as common as people seem to think they are. Most systems have evolved or are designed to stay far out of critical parameter ranges. Mostly, the numbers are not worth the sweat put into them...
>
> 11. The sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.
>
> ... You can often stabilize a system by increasing the capacity of a buffer. But if a buffer is too big, the system gets inflexible. It reacts too slowly. And big buffers of some sorts, such as water reservoirs or inventories, cost a lot to build or maintain. Businesses invented just-in-time inventories, because occasional vulnerability to fluctuations or screw-ups is cheaper (for them, anyway) than certain, constant inventory costs — and because small-to-vanishing inventories allow more flexible response to shifting demand. There’s leverage, sometimes magical, in changing the size of buffers. But buffers are usually physical entities, not easy to change...

> The plumbing structure, the stocks and flows and their physical arrangement, can have an enormous effect on how the system operates... The only way to fix a system that is laid out wrong is to rebuild it, if you can... But often physical rebuilding is the slowest and most expensive kind of change to make in a system. Some stock-and-flow structures are just plain unchangeable. The baby-boom swell in the U.S. population first caused pressure on the elementary school system, then high schools, then colleges, then jobs and housing, and now we’re looking forward to supporting its retirement... Physical structure is crucial in a system, but rarely a leverage point, because changing it is rarely quick or simple. The leverage point is in proper design in the first place. After the structure is built, the leverage is in understanding its limitations and bottlenecks, using it with maximum efficiency, and refraining from fluctuations or expansions that strain its capacity.
>
> 9. The lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system changes.
>
> ... Delays in feedback loops are critical determinants of system behavior. They are common causes of oscillations. If you’re trying to adjust a system state to your goal, but you only receive delayed information about what the system state is, you will overshoot and undershoot. Same if your information is timely, but your response isn’t... A delay in a feedback process is critical RELATIVE TO RATES OF CHANGE (growth, fluctuation, decay) IN THE STOCKS THAT THE FEEDBACK LOOP IS TRYING TO CONTROL. Delays that are too short cause overreaction, “chasing your tail,” oscillations amplified by the jumpiness of the response. Delays that are too long cause damped, sustained, or exploding oscillations, depending on how much too long. At the extreme they cause chaos. Overlong delays in a system with a threshold, a danger point, a range past which irreversible damage can occur, cause overshoot and collapse. I would list delay length as a high leverage point, except for the fact that delays are not often easily changeable. Things take as long as they take. You can’t do a lot about the construction time of a major piece of capital, or the maturation time of a child, or the growth rate of a forest. It’s usually easier to SLOW DOWN THE CHANGE RATE, so that inevitable feedback delays won’t cause so much trouble. That’s why growth rates are higher up on the leverage-point list than delay times. And that’s why slowing economic growth is a greater leverage point in Forrester’s world model than faster technological development or freer market prices. Those are attempts to speed up the rate of adjustment. But the world’s physical capital plant, its factories and boilers, the concrete manifestations of its working technologies, can only change so fast, even in the face of new prices or new ideas — and prices and ideas don’t change instantly either, not through a whole global culture. There’s more leverage in slowing the system down so technologies and prices can keep up with it, than there is in wishing the delays away. But if there is a delay in your system that can be changed, changing it can have big effects. Watch out! Be sure you change it in the right direction! (For example, the great push to reduce information and money transfer delays in financial markets is just asking for wild gyrations)

> 8. The strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.
>
> Now we’re beginning to move from the physical part of the system to the information and control parts, where more leverage can be found. Negative feedback loops are ubiquitous in systems. Nature evolves them and humans invent them as controls to keep important system states within safe bounds. A thermostat loop is the classic example. Its purpose is to keep the system state called “room temperature” fairly constant at a desired level. Any negative feedback loop needs a goal (the thermostat setting), a monitoring and signaling device to detect excursions from the goal (the thermostat), and a response mechanism (the furnace and/or air conditioner, fans, heat pipes, fuel, etc.). A complex system usually has numerous negative feedback loops it can bring into play, so it can self-correct under different conditions and impacts. Some of those loops may be inactive much of the time — like the emergency cooling system in a nuclear power plant, or your ability to sweat or shiver to maintain your body temperature — but their presence is critical to the long-term welfare of the system. One of the big mistakes we make is to strip away these “emergency” response mechanisms because they aren’t often used and they appear to be costly. In the short term we see no effect from doing this. In the long term, we drastically narrow the range of conditions over which the system can survive... The “strength” of a negative loop — its ability to keep its appointed stock at or near its goal — depends on the combination of all its parameters and links — the accuracy and rapidity of monitoring, the quickness and power of response, the directness and size of corrective flows. Sometimes there are leverage points here. Take markets, for example, the negative feedback systems that are all but worshipped by economists — and they can indeed be marvels of self-correction, as prices vary to moderate supply and demand and keep them in balance. The more the price — the central piece of information signaling both producers and consumers — is kept clear, unambiguous, timely, and truthful, the more smoothly markets will operate. Prices that reflect full costs will tell consumers how much they can actually afford and will reward efficient producers. Companies and governments are fatally attracted to the price leverage point, of course, all of them determinedly pushing it in the wrong direction with subsidies, fixes, externalities, taxes, and other forms of confusion. These folks are trying to weaken the feedback power of market signals by twisting information in their favor. The REAL leverage here is to keep them from doing it. Hence the necessity of anti-trust laws, truth-in-advertising laws, attempts to internalize costs (such as pollution taxes), the removal of perverse subsidies, and other ways of leveling market playing fields. None of which get far these days, because of the weakening of another set of negative feedback loops — those of democracy. This great system was invented to put self-correcting feedback between the people and their government. The people, informed about what their elected representatives do, respond by voting those representatives in or out of office. The process depends upon the free, full, unbiased flow of information back and forth between electorate and leaders. Billions of dollars are spent to limit and bias and dominate that flow. Give the people who want to distort market price signals the power to pay off government leaders, get the channels of communication to be self-interested corporate partners themselves, and none of the necessary negative feedbacks work well. Both market and democracy erode. The strength of a negative feedback loop is important RELATIVE TO THE IMPACT IT IS DESIGNED TO CORRECT. If the impact increases in strength, the feedbacks have to be strengthened too. A thermostat system may work fine on a cold winter day — but open all the windows and its corrective power will fail. Democracy worked better before the advent of the brainwashing power of centralized mass communications. Traditional controls on fishing were sufficient until radar spotting and drift nets and other technologies made it possible for a few actors to wipe out the fish. The power of big industry calls for the power of big government to hold it in check; a global economy makes necessary a global government and global regulations...
>
> 7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
>
> A negative feedback loop is self-correcting; a positive feedback loop is self-reinforcing. The more it works, the more it gains power to work some more... Positive feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. A system with an unchecked positive loop ultimately will destroy itself. That’s why there are so few of them. Usually a negative loop will kick in sooner or later. The epidemic will run out of infectable people — or people will take increasingly strong steps to avoid being infected... Reducing the gain around a positive loop — slowing the growth — is usually a more powerful leverage point in systems than strengthening negative loops, and much preferable to letting the positive loop run... Another example: there are many positive feedback loops in society that reward the winners of a competition with the resources to win even bigger next time. Systems folks call them “success to the successful” loops. Rich people collect interest; poor people pay it. Rich people pay accountants and lean on politicians to reduce their taxes; poor people can’t. Rich people give their kids inheritances and good educations; poor kids lose out. Anti-poverty programs are weak negative loops that try to counter these strong positive ones. It would be much more effective to weaken the positive loops. That’s what progressive income tax, inheritance tax, and universal high-quality public education programs are meant to do. (If rich people can buy government and weaken, rather than strengthen those of measures, the government, instead of balancing “success to the successful” loops, becomes just another instrument to reinforce them!)... In more ordinary systems, look for leverage points around birth rates, interest rates, erosion rates, “success to the successful” loops, any place where the more you have of something, the more you have the possibility of having more.

> 6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).
>
> ... Missing feedback is one of the most common causes of system malfunction. Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention, usually much easier and cheaper than rebuilding physical infrastructure. The tragedy of the commons that is crashing the world’s commercial fisheries occurs because there is no feedback from the state of the fish population to the decision to invest in fishing vessels. (Contrary to economic opinion, the price of fish doesn’t provide that feedback. As the fish get more scarce and hence more expensive, it becomes all the more profitable to go out and catch them. That’s a perverse feedback, a positive loop that leads to collapse.) It’s important that the missing feedback be restored to the right place and in compelling form. To take another tragedy of the commons, it’s not enough to inform all the users of an aquifer that the groundwater level is dropping. That could initiate a race to the bottom. It would be more effective to set a water price that rises steeply as the pumping rate begins to exceed the recharge rate... Compelling feedback. Suppose taxpayers got to specify on their return forms what government services their tax payments must be spent on... Suppose (this is an old one) the politicians who declare war were required to spend that war in the front lines. There is a systematic tendency on the part of human beings to avoid accountability for their own decisions. That’s why there are so many missing feedback loops — and why this kind of leverage point is so often popular with the masses, unpopular with the powers that be, and effective, if you can get the powers that be to permit it to happen (or go around them and make it happen anyway).

> 5. The rules of the system (incentives, punishments, constraints).
>
> The rules of the system define its scope, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom. Thou shalt not kill. Everyone has the right of free speech. Contracts are to be honored... Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the USSR and opened information flows (glasnost) and changed the economic rules (perestroika), and look what happened. Constitutions are the strongest examples of social rules. Physical laws such as the second law of thermodynamics are absolute rules, whether we understand them or not or like them or not. Laws, punishments, incentives, and informal social agreements are progressively weaker rules... Suppose tenure were awarded to professors according to their ability to solve real-world problems, rather than to publish academic papers... As we try to imagine restructured rules like that and what our behavior would be under them, we come to understand the power of rules. They are high leverage points. Power over the rules is real power. That’s why lobbyists congregate when Congress writes laws, and why the Supreme Court, which interprets and delineates the Constitution — the rules for writing the rules — has even more power than Congress. If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of systems, pay attention to the rules, and to who has power over them. That’s why my systems intuition was sending off alarm bells as the new world trade system was explained to me. It is a system with rules designed by corporations, run by corporations, for the benefit of corporations. Its rules exclude almost any feedback from any other sector of society. Most of its meetings are closed even to the press (no information flow, no feedback). It forces nations into positive loops “racing to the bottom,” competing with each other to weaken environmental and social safeguards in order to attract corporate investment. It’s a recipe for unleashing “success to the successful” loops, until they generate enormous accumulations of power and huge centralized planning systems that will destroy themselves, just as the Soviet Union destroyed itself, and for similar systemic reasons.

> 4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
>
> The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human economies it’s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems lingo it’s called self-organization. Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list — adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or computers — adding new negative or positive loops, or new rules. The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself. The human immune system has the power to develop new responses to (some kinds of ) insults it has never before encountered. The human brain can take in new information and pop out completely new thoughts. Further investigation of self-organizing systems reveals that the divine creator, if there is one, does not have to produce evolutionary miracles. He, she, or it just has to write marvelously clever RULES FOR SELF-ORGANIZATION. These rules basically govern how, where, and what the system can add onto or subtract from itself under what conditions. As hundreds of self-organizing computer models have demonstrated, complex and delightful patterns can evolve from quite simple evolutionary algorithms. (That need not mean that real-world algorithms are simple, only that they can be.) The genetic code within the DNA that is the basis of all biological evolution contains just four different letters, combined into words of three letters each. That pattern, and the rules for replicating and rearranging it, has been constant for something like three billion years, during which it has spewed out an unimaginable variety of failed and successful self-evolved creatures. Self-organization is basically a matter of an evolutionary raw material — a highly variable stock of information from which to select possible patterns — and a means for experimentation, for selecting and testing new patterns. For biological evolution the raw material is DNA, one source of variety is spontaneous mutation, and the testing mechanism is something like punctuated Darwinian selection. For technology the raw material is the body of understanding science has accumulated and stored in libraries and in the brains of its practitioners. The source of variety is human creativity (whatever THAT is) and the selection mechanism can be whatever the market will reward, or whatever governments and foundations will fund, or whatever meets human needs. When you understand the power of system self-organization, you begin to understand why biologists worship biodiversity even more than economists worship technology. The wildly varied stock of DNA, evolved and accumulated over billions of years, is the source of evolutionary potential, just as science libraries and labs and universities where scientists are trained are the source of technological potential. Allowing species to go extinct is a systems crime, just as randomly eliminating all copies of particular science journals, or particular kinds of scientists, would be. The same could be said of human cultures, of course, which are the store of behavioral repertoires, accumulated over not billions, but hundreds of thousands of years. They are a stock out of which social evolution can arise. Unfortunately, people appreciate the precious evolutionary potential of cultures even less than they understand the preciousness of every genetic variation in the world’s ground squirrels. I guess that’s because one aspect of almost every culture is the belief in the utter superiority of that culture. Insistence on a single culture shuts down learning. Cuts back resilience. Any system, biological, economic, or social, that gets so encrusted that it cannot self-evolve, a system that systematically scorns experimentation and wipes out the raw material of innovation, is doomed over the long term on this highly variable planet. The intervention point here is obvious, but unpopular. Encouraging variability and experimentation and diversity means “losing control.” Let a thousand flowers bloom and ANYTHING could happen! Who wants that? Let’s play it safe and push this leverage point in the wrong direction by wiping out biological, cultural, social, and market diversity!
>
> 3. The goals of the system.
>
> Right there, the diversity-destroying consequence of the push for control, that demonstrates why the goal of a system is a leverage point superior to the self-organizing ability of a system. If the goal is to bring more and more of the world under the control of one particular central planning system (the empire of Genghis Khan, the world of Islam, the People’s Republic of China, Wal-Mart, Disney, whatever), then everything further down the list, physical stocks and flows, feedback loops, information flows, even self-organizing behavior, will be twisted to conform to that goal. That’s why I can’t get into arguments about whether genetic engineering is a “good” or a “bad” thing. Like all technologies, it depends upon who is wielding it, with what goal. The only thing one can say is that if corporations wield it for the purpose of generating marketable products, that is a very different goal, a different selection mechanism, a different direction for evolution than anything the planet has seen so far... Even people within systems don’t often recognize what whole-system goal they are serving. To make profits, most corporations would say, but that’s just a rule, a necessary condition to stay in the game. What is the point of the game? To grow, to increase market share, to bring the world (customers, suppliers, regulators) more and more under the control of the corporation, so that its operations becomes ever more shielded from uncertainty. John Kenneth Galbraith recognized that corporate goal — to engulf everything — long ago.5 It’s the goal of a cancer too. Actually it’s the goal of every living population — and only a bad one when it isn’t balanced by higher-level negative feedback loops that never let an upstart power-loop-driven entity control the world. The goal of keeping the market competitive has to trump the goal of each corporation to eliminate its competitors (and brainwash its customers and swallow its suppliers), just as in ecosystems, the goal of keeping populations in balance and evolving has to trump the goal of each population to reproduce without limit...

> 2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
>
> ... The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions — unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows them — constitute that society’s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the world works. There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of Homo sapiens. One can “own” land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit obvious. Paradigms are the sources of systems. From them, from shared social agreements about the nature of reality, come system goals and information flows, feedbacks, stocks, flows and everything else about systems... The ancient Egyptians built pyramids because they believed in an afterlife. We build skyscrapers, because we believe that space in downtown cities is enormously valuable. (Except for blighted spaces, often near the skyscrapers, which we believe are worthless.) Whether it was Copernicus and Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point that totally transforms systems. You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not second-to-highest. But there’s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter — they resist challenges to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else. So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science, has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded. Systems folks would say you change paradigms by modeling a system, which takes you outside the system and forces you to see it whole. We say that because our own paradigms have been changed that way.
>
> 1. The power to transcend paradigms.
>
> There is yet one leverage point that is even higher than changing a paradigm. That is to keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that NO paradigm is “true,” that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding of an immense and amazing universe that is far beyond human comprehension. It is to “get” at a gut level the paradigm that there are paradigms, and to see that that itself is a paradigm, and to regard that whole realization as devastatingly funny. It is to let go into Not Knowing, into what the Buddhists call enlightenment. People who cling to paradigms (which means just about all of us) take one look at the spacious possibility that everything they think is guaranteed to be nonsense and pedal rapidly in the opposite direction. Surely there is no power, no control, no understanding, not even a reason for being, much less acting, in the notion or experience that there is no certainty in any worldview. But, in fact, everyone who has managed to entertain that idea, for a moment or for a lifetime, has found it to be the basis for radical empowerment. If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose... It is in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off addictions, live in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or burned at the stake or crucified or shot, and have impacts that last for millennia." - [Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System, by Donella Meadows](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)

> "I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.
>
> ... Since short and simple explanations of the past usually reflect some repetitive regularity that helps to predict the future as well, every intelligent system interested in achieving future goals should be motivated to compress the history of raw sensory inputs in response to its actions, simply to improve its ability to plan ahead. A long time ago, Piaget already explained the explorative learning behavior of children through his concepts of assimilation (new inputs are embedded in old schemas—this may be viewed as a type of compression) and accommodation (adapting an old schema to a new input—this may be viewed as a type of compression improvement).
>
> ... There is one thing that is involved in all actions and sensory inputs of the agent, namely, the agent itself. To efficiently encode the entire data history, it will profit from creating some sort of internal symbol or code (e. g., a neural activity pattern) representing the agent itself. Whenever this representation is actively used, say, by activating the corresponding neurons through new incoming sensory inputs or otherwise, the agent could be called self-aware or conscious.
>
> ... In absence of external reward, or when there is no known way to further increase the expected external reward, our controller essentially tries to maximize true novelty or interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, the steepness of the learning curve. It will do its best to select action sequences expected to create observations yielding maximal expected future compression progress, given the limitations of both the compressor and the compressor improvement algorithm. It will learn to focus its attention and its actively chosen experiments on things that are currently still incompressible but are expected to become compressible / predictable through additional learning. It will get bored by things that already are subjectively compressible. It will also get bored by things that are currently incompressible but will apparently remain so, given the experience so far, or where the costs of making them compressible exceed those of making other things compressible, etc.
>
> ... Undoubtedly many derive pleasure and rewards from perceiving works of art, such as certain paintings, or songs. But different subjective observers with different sensory apparati and compressor improvement algorithms will prefer different input sequences. Hence any objective theory of what is good art must take the subjective observer as a parameter, to answer questions such as: Which sequences of actions and resulting shifts of attention should he execute to maximize his pleasure? According to our principle he should select one that maximizes the quickly learnable compressibility that is new, relative to his current knowledge and his (usually limited) way of incorporating / learning / compressing new data.
>
> ... many physicists invent experiments to create data governed by previously unknown laws allowing to further compress the data... The essence of science is to formally nail down the nature of compression progress achieved through the discovery of a new regularity. For example, the law of gravity can be described by just a few symbols.

> ... We pointed out that a surprisingly simple algorithmic principle based on the notions of data compression and data compression progress informally explains fundamental aspects of attention, novelty, surprise, interestingness, curiosity, creativity, subjective beauty, jokes, and science & art in general. The crucial ingredients of the corresponding formal framework are (1) a continually improving predictor or compressor of the continually growing data history, (2) a computable measure of the compressor’s progress (to calculate intrinsic rewards), (3) a reward optimizer or reinforcement learner translating rewards into action sequences expected to maximize future reward." - [Driven by Compression Progress](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4360)

> "When considering planetary intelligence as a CAS however we wish to ultilize John Holland’s emphasis on the role of boundaries and signals in their operation (Holland, 2012). Emergence establishes an upward and downward cascade of order in living systems (organelles, cells, organs, animal, community) and for Holland such systems were always characterized by a boundary that was self-establishing. Most importantly, a primary function of these boundaries was to recognize signals. The boundary has to know what to keep in/out and what to let in/out. Without such signal processing, the boundary is nothing more than an inanimate wall. Thus, information flows embedded with significance through self-maintained boundaries represent critical elements of life and its use of semantic information at different levels of organization.
>
> ... Autopoiesis means self-making or self-producing. An autopoietic system is a network of processes that recursively depend on each other for their own generation and realization. From this perspective, life is an autonomous system that is organizationally closed. Organizational closure means the individuality of a biological system is created by the system itself. Thus, living systems have the capacity to maintain their identities in spite of fluctuations and perturbations coming from without. In this view, life is a process of maintaining an identity from within. However, this unity is never static and can never be ‘durably secured’. The organism must always operationally reconstitute itself by maintaining the physiochemical and information processing capacities that constitute its own ‘going-on’. It must continually create the conditions for its own existence via metabolism. If the dynamic falters or stops, the organism dies.
>
> ... A succinct definition is given by Shettleworth (1993) who sees cognition as ‘the mechanisms by which animals acquire, process, store, and act on information from the environment’. A more extensive definition is given by Lyon (2015). Biological cognition is the complex of sensory and other information-processing mechanisms an organism has for becoming familiar with, valuing and interacting with its environment in order to meet existential goals, the most basic of which are survival (growth or thriving) and reproduction.
>
> ... While our current, early-Anthropocene phase displays key features of a planetary intelligence, e.g. an emergent CAS composed of multi-layered networks of semantic information flows, it appears to lack the critical characteristic of autopoietic selfmaintenance. Recall that a system will be autopoietic if it is both self-creating and self-maintaining. Self-maintenance requires operational closure such that the system can create the processes and products that are themselves necessary for maintaining those processes and products, thus allowing the system to persist. But by driving the coupled Earth systems beyond their safe-operating boundaries (i.e. a Holocene climate state), early-Anthropocene human activity is threatening/degrading, rather than maintaining, these processes and products. Thus, we might consider the current Earth state as representing an ‘immature’ technosphere in which the full suite of properties we would associate with planetary intelligence have yet to emerge.
>
> ... Human civilization’s entry into the Anthropocene, and the potential existential threat it represents, demonstrates that energy-harvesting capacities alone are not enough to meaningfully characterize the evolution of technospheres. One lesson of the Anthropocene appears to be the importance of developing global regulatory feedback loops across the whole of the host world’s coupled planetary systems. In this way, it is useful to consider the establishment of mature planetary intelligence as a potential necessary condition for the existence of long-lived technospheres.
>
> ... From the perspective of the goals of this paper, the generation of robust and stable steady-states between technospheres, biospheres and the other coupled systems would involve the clearest example of planetary intelligence. Here the collective agency of the individual components of the technosphere and biosphere are marshalled for explicitly planetary scale goals. Like the early stage Anthropocene, a Class V world includes a technosphere giving it the first set of characteristics in our definition of planetary intelligence: emergence; networks of semantic information flow; the operation of the technosphere as a CAS including the functioning of signal-sensitive boundaries. Unlike the early stage Anthropocene (which we have argued is an immature Technosphere) the mature technosphere on a Class V planet would have achieved operational closure by deliberately adapting its own activities to function within the limits (temporal and spatial) of the other planetary systems. Thus, a mature technosphere would not function independently from the other systems. Instead, it would have adapted to function within the boundaries of a newly enlarged whole that includes its own activities. In short, a class V planet would exhibit planetary scale intelligence (cognitive activity) and, as such, would be autopoietic.
>
> Grinspoon (2016) has argued that Class V worlds could represent the beginning of planet’s entering not just a new geological epoch, as in the Anthropocene, but a new eon, which could continue for hundreds of millions of years or more. Just as the other recognized eon boundaries in Earth history can be seen to represent transitions in the functional relationships between the biosphere and the rest of the Earth system, this ‘sapezioc’ eon would involve the application of not just cognition via semantic information flows operating on planetary scales but of wisdom in the sense of ‘the ability to act with judgment born of experience’. Thus, planets in a sapezoic phase would be those in which wise self-management (i.e. the civilization’s construction of the technosphere) and wise planetary management are one and the same. The mechanisms for self-management must themselves be collective and global in scale.
>
> ... For ‘mature technospheres’, however, the interventions will be intentional. They will be purposely Gaian and designed to maintain the sustainability of both the biosphere and the technosphere as a coupled system. At the short end, ozone replenishment and climate mitigation would occur on decades to century timescales. Terraforming of uninhabited worlds (if possible) is estimated to require up to 1000-year timescales. Planetary defence from asteroids would require the development of systems that would operate over timescales for ‘city buster’ impacts (>1000 years). At the longest timescales and highest technological capacity, intentional changes in stellar evolution (if possible) to prolong habitability would occur over millions of years.
>
> We make no absolute claims at this point as to the underlying cognitive nature of species that could create a planetary intelligence, but a minimal criterion might be that they should be social. It is possible that only species emerging from particular evolutionary paths, such as eusociality (ants, termites, etc., on Earth), are capable of bringing such global scale cooperative behaviour into existence. Since planetary intelligence acts as a CAS, the existence of a ‘central authority’ is not necessary. A hallmark of a CAS is the mechanism by which local interactions can give rise to global structures and behaviour (Levin, 2005). Top-down causation, where the high-level emergent structures alter local behaviour is also seen by some to be essential to CAS operations (Levin, 1998). There is considerable literature on how different forms of governance, including democracies, can function as a CAS (Buckley, 1998; Bednar and Page, 2016, Geiselhart, 2007). Many of these provide examples of how planetary intelligence could emerge without a single planetary authority serving as the means to agency.
>
> Finally, we consider the role of boundaries and signals in the establishment of planetary intelligence at this level. One might expect a Class V civilization to have the technological capacities to develop a fully functioning asteroid defence. More importantly, though the near-space environment could prove to be a vital part of the integration of the technosphere with the biosphere (Fig. 1 (d)). Certainly, one expects sophisticated forms of remote sensing to be part of the tool kit deployed for such integration. But beyond simple planetary scale self-monitoring, one can also imagine that remote interventions may also be part of the toolkit used to develop sustainability. Past these kinds of science fiction-esque visions, the idea of boundaries and signals can take on a less concrete manifestation. The very idea that a technosphere must operate within the safe operating boundaries of the biosphere/geosphere it is embedded in means that new levels of monitoring and response must be developed and deployed on planetary scales.
>
> ... Humanity currently sits at a precipice: our collective actions clearly have global consequences, but we are not yet in control of those consequences. A transition to planetary intelligence, as we described here, would have the hallmark property of intelligence operating at a planetary scale. Such planetary intelligence would be capable of steering the future evolution of Earth, acting in concert with planetary systems and guided by a deep understanding of such systems.
>
> ... A critical question is how viewing intelligence as a planetary scale process can help us adapt to and learn to harness the changes we are driving for our own long-term sustainability. Of course, the first question to ask is sustainability for whom? ‘Civilization’ at present is highly unequal in terms of those populations who have the greatest agency in effecting planetary change and those who are the most vulnerable to the consequences of planetary instabilities. Humans, or our descendants in the far future, may be very different than we are at present. Thus, the question of planetary intelligence is as much an ethical and moral one, as it is a scientific one. It implicitly assumes there is collective action that can operate for collective good, at the scale of global dynamical processes. As we have pointed out, what is best for individuals is not always optimal for collectives (e.g. cheating in evolutionary biology). Thus, the transition to planetary intelligence will have to overcome some of the same selfish challenges that evolution has faced repeatedly in the >3.5 billion year history of life on this planet. In fact, we can view the transition to global intelligence as a major transition in evolution, but one that must occur at the planetary scale (Furukawa and Walker, 2018).
>
> However, unlike other major transitions in the history of life on Earth, the transition to planetary intelligence is marked by lower-level components (e.g. us) who have some awareness of what is happening. By contrast, it is difficult to conclude that individual cells were aware of, or had a choice in, their joining together to enact multicellularity. Global transitions are already happening affecting almost everything about our daily lives, from what we eat and where, to our social behaviours and economic activity. Often the global features that regulate our behaviour as individuals are mediated by bottom-up action only, that is they are emergent properties of our complex global system. They are not necessarily steered at that global level however. Thus, we are in some sense partway through a major transition, where we have relinquished some of our individuality and behaviours, but we have not yet emerged on the other side where we are in it for the collective good." - [Intelligence as a planetary scale process](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/intelligence-as-a-planetary-scale-process/5077C784D7FAC55F96072F7A7772C5E5)

> "Humans are among the most cooperative and social species on the planet. As Harvard evolutionary biologist Martin Nowak puts it, we are “super cooperators.” Throughout our history, individual survival was often tied to group survival, so our species evolved strong instincts to initiate and sustain cooperation. Those instincts have a positive side, what researchers call “prosocial behaviors,” such as generosity, reciprocity and the desire to build trust in relationships. But they also have a dark side. When people feel they have been cooperative and contributed, but others have not played their part and have instead been free riders who lie, cheat and take advantage of the nice cooperators, then they react with a sense of moral outrage and a desire to punish those who have violated cooperative norms.
>
> In fact, experiments show that people are willing to dish out punishments that are more costly to themselves than any possible benefit. We see this not just in the lab but in the real world. Consider acrimonious lawsuits or divorce cases where the aggrieved parties sue each other into financial oblivion. While standard economic theory might say such behavior is “irrational,” it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. When people go a bit crazy and dish out punishments that are costly for themselves, they are in effect taking one for the team and helping enforce norms of cooperation for the group as a whole. Researchers call this “altruistic punishment,” and it means that potential cheaters and free riders pay a higher cost for their bad behavior than if every individual was strictly “rational.” Further experiments show that without altruistic punishment, free-riding and cheating go up, and it is very hard for groups to establish and sustain cooperation.
>
> Another common reaction when people feel fairness is violated is to team up with other people who feel cheated as well. If cooperation is broadly breaking down, it makes sense to seek out people like yourself, who you can trust, and fight back together against the perceived violators. In history, the notion of “people like me” has often meant people who share some common identity (e.g., ethnic, religious, regional, cultural). So, when larger-scale societal cooperation breaks down, identity-based tribalism often goes up." - [Trust, Populism and the Psychology of Broken Contracts, by Eric Beinhocker](https://www.edelman.com/trust/edelman-trust-institute/Publication/2023/trust-populism-and-broken-contracts#:~:text=Humans%20are%20among,often%20goes%20up.)

C. The Markov blanket has sensory nodes that measure the potentially destructive forces that act on the system and active nodes that allow it to undertake behaviours that counteract these forces. In this way the Markov blanket is maintained such that the system within continues to exist. D. The physical dynamics that allow this process to occur can be described as reducing free energy within the system. Free energy reduction is equivalent to parts of the system internal to the Markov blanket acting as a model of the external events that account for the sensory evidence arriving at the Markov blanket. From the perspective of statistical physics, in order for living systems to exist they must infer the properties that exist in their external environment.
