> 2. While this kind of approach will get us to a place somewhat similar to Twitter (minus the "trending" centralized object), we want to build a community that is more truth-oriented than Twitter. This is where triangulation and "the motion parallax of time" (aka. predictions) come into play. The shared, un-gameable global object all participants have access to is called "underlying reality", featuring the passage of time... Someone building a predictive record with a history of being more correct than others, creates a hard-to-fake signal for the objective value of this account. And much in the spirit of the ELO rating system in chess, observers can then use these predictions to construct a mostly-objective ranking of the various pundits in their field of vision. It may require them to be able to mostly-correctly identify whose predictions have been correct in the past, but that is a far easier task than predicting the future or choosing between different pundits arguing over an issue without access to prior track records. It's up to each agent to evaluate others' track record, and they have skin in the game to lose.

If we actually think clearly, rather than trying to gather support through an endless sequence of committees, what is the actual essential universal goal of human life that we can rally everybody around?

> "The popular phrase "What Would Jesus Do" (WWJD) serves as a moral compass for many Christians in the form of a reminder to consider what Jesus might do in a given situation when making moral decisions. The devout Christian who thinks "What Would Jesus Do?" before making a choice has constructed an internal model of Jesus and he has become an agent with causal power inside that person's cognitive system. This mental model is constructed from the information, stories, and teachings found in the Bible and are influenced by an individual's personal beliefs and interpretation of that text." - [Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/introducing-neuromancy-enhancing#:~:text=The%20popular%20phrase,of%20that%20text.)

> "If you put these three principles of design together, you get a pretty plausible explanation of the human predicament as diagnosed by the Buddha. Yes, as he said, pleasure is fleeting, and, yes, this leaves us recurrently dissatisfied. And the reason is that pleasure is designed by natural selection to evaporate so that the ensuing dissatisfaction will get us to pursue more pleasure. Natural selection doesn’t “want” us to be happy, after all; it just “wants” us to be productive, in its narrow sense of productive. And the way to make us productive is to make the anticipation of pleasure very strong but the pleasure itself not very long-lasting." - [Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9075501-if-you-put-these-three-principles-of-design-together-you)

> "Emotions are hypothesized to be neurocomputational adaptations designed by natural selection to coordinate the operations of multiple systems within the organism (e.g., perceptual, metabolic, and motivational systems) and to orchestrate system-wide functional responses to speciﬁc ancestrally-recurrent adaptive problems. This framework has been fruitfully applied to develop theories about the evolved functions and computational architectures of emotional programs labeled “pride” and “shame”. According to these theories, pride and shame each evolved to solve distinct problems related to managing one's social value in the minds of others. Pride functions to promote a person's socially-valued traits and achievements to upwardly recalibrate others' internal valuation of the person experiencing and expressing pride. Shame functions to prevent the spread of socially-disvalued information about the self and to mitigate the costs of any resultant social devaluation." - [Pride and shame: Key components of a culturally universal status management system](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2019/08/pride-and-shame-EHB-2019.pdf)

> "Human status is acquired within the context of a social exchange contract of service-for-prestige, which stipulates that group members will allocate greater status to individuals to the extent that they generate beneﬁts for the community and its members. If high-ranking individuals fail to generate suﬃcient beneﬁts to deserve their status, other group members can easily depose them through coalitional action. Thus, to an unprecedented degree among the apes, the acquisition and maintenance of status by ancestral humans was dependent upon the extent to which an individual's perceived contributions to a community were intrinsically valued by others." - [Pride and shame: Key components of a culturally universal status management system](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2019/08/pride-and-shame-EHB-2019.pdf)
