> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary view is not deterministic and so we cannot say that the future emergence of a common governance and energy regime will be achieved. However, the possibility of such a common metasystem is the highest potentiality of a Global Brain Singularity." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "What does it mean to live within an evolutionary universe and be agents of fundamental evolutionary processes? We simply do not have sensical and well-defined answers to these questions. We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action. What in the world happens to our understanding when the transcendental structure that overdetermines our existence becomes something that not only changes across time but is also something constituted by our action and modalities of being?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Throughout scientific history we have come to imagine ourselves as separate, marginal or accidental by-products in a meaningless universe. In fact, it has not been uncommon for scientific progress in understanding the universe to become coupled with a type of existential nihilistic worldview in relation to the human phenomenon." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Whatever ‘act’ comes next in the ‘cosmic drama’ it will emerge from within the domain of collective human social values, cultural creativity and our exploration of latent technological possibility. In this way the universe gives the appearance of internalizing its future potentiality within a network of billions of biocultural nodes that in aggregate represent a phenomenon capable of producing yet another level of complex organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Even in the face of overwhelming global obstacles (or even because we face overwhelming global obstacles), we cannot forget the hope for a higher world: a world where the structural conditions of civilization enable the highest flourishing of the human creative imagination; or even: the distributed emergence of a collective common goal that does not rest on an external necessary God [either religious (/supernatural), governmental (/bureaucratic), or market (/financial)] but on an internally generated intersubjective value system supporting collective freedom and immortality (a true universality)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the same way the humanist-atheist axis challenged and overcame ancient religious and sociopolitical fundamentalisms consequently producing modernity; now the transmodernist axis must emerge to challenge postmodern relativistic thinking by positing a higher transcendental transhumanism as dedicated to forming its own ground. Such a ground could potentially be imagined under the scheme of a self-organized commons. Faith in our own ability and our own mind is the only way to overcome postmodern tensions and cynicism produced by contemporary government, market and religious fundamentalist historical traps." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "I do not think we should simply deconstruct the State, or Capitalism or Religion, but rather radically democratize and distribute the processes that are currently actualized in the State, Capital and Religion via reflective dialectical engagement." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Another potential ramification is that the importance of financial capital could be replaced by a shift towards the importance of ‘social capital’ (i.e. psychological self-actualization and community building). In this potential future direction our adult socioeconomic lives could become increasingly dominated by finding important ways to interconnect and relate to each other as social and creative beings, as opposed to our current reality of finding ways to interconnect and relate to each other as economic agents (Rifkin 2014)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The theoretical emphasis in technological singularity literature (i.e. emergence of AGI) almost completely ignores the systemic dynamics of technological revolution in relation to the emerging sociotechnological sphere mediated by the totality of the internet as universal medium. In missing this systemic dynamic the technological singularity literature fails to even confront basic issues of systemic transitions in relation to control, power and hierarchy, and thus basic issues of systemic transitions in terms of social, economic and political life." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the AGI technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on individual machine-learning programs that enter ‘self-recursive cycles’ of exponential intellect improvement towards ‘post-humanity’. However, in the GB technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on collective global issues and metasystemic transitions related to power, control and hierarchy. This is not to say that the GB technological singularity vision totally negates the possibility of the emergence of AGI or even post-humanity, but rather approaches the emerging technological revolution as a phenomenon that must be grounded in the totality of sociotechnological process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Can the Global Brain as a ‘universal coordination medium’ that ‘self-organizes on a planetary level’ function to inscribe a world that operates on ‘Global Commons’ logic (systems of access and democratic management) over and above both market and state logic? Would this not be a world where ‘automated smart systems’ and ‘distributed social/offer networks’ become universalized towards serving humanist-ecological use value?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter-intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self-reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "When we think of the technocultural era in big historical terms we are not so much confronted with the future of ‘humans’ (as we typically think of humans) but the future of self-designed intelligent-spiritual ‘beings’ self-organized towards a higher level of thought... The technological singularity concept forces us to imagine a black hole of experience, an event horizon beyond which we could know nothing for certain about the deep future. In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Beings are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we are all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)
