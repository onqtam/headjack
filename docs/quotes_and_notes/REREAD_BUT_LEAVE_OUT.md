> "A paradigm is a large pattern of interconnected and mutually reinforcing ideas, presuppositions, and values—and the pattern is partly invisible to all who think according to that paradigm." - [Education for Protopia: Why Play Is Vital to our Survival, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/education-for-protopia-why-play-is-vital-to-our-survival/)




> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "What does it mean that a being has come into being which is modelling being and itself in increasingly recursive modalities?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary view is not deterministic and so we cannot say that the future emergence of a common governance and energy regime will be achieved. However, the possibility of such a common metasystem is the highest potentiality of a Global Brain Singularity." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "What does it mean to live within an evolutionary universe and be agents of fundamental evolutionary processes? We simply do not have sensical and well-defined answers to these questions. We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action. What in the world happens to our understanding when the transcendental structure that overdetermines our existence becomes something that not only changes across time but is also something constituted by our action and modalities of being?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Both reductionism and postmodernity, albeit successful in different ways within the sciences and humanities, cannot help us in terms of formulating a better understanding of universal history and its meaning for the human species moving forward into our common future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Throughout scientific history we have come to imagine ourselves as separate, marginal or accidental by-products in a meaningless universe. In fact, it has not been uncommon for scientific progress in understanding the universe to become coupled with a type of existential nihilistic worldview in relation to the human phenomenon." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Whatever ‘act’ comes next in the ‘cosmic drama’ it will emerge from within the domain of collective human social values, cultural creativity and our exploration of latent technological possibility. In this way the universe gives the appearance of internalizing its future potentiality within a network of billions of biocultural nodes that in aggregate represent a phenomenon capable of producing yet another level of complex organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution, or the reproduction of symbolic code, will not necessarily remain dependent on a biological substrate indefinitely." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)
