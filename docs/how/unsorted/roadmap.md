# Go to ~~market~~ people's heads & growth strategy

- first 1k/10k indexes reserved & given with auctions/randomly to influential ppl
    - elon could get index 42 - the answer to the universe

growth hack: show some badge who invited you to the network (and how many people you have invited) - perhaps with some referral link initially?
strategy: referral links and giving status retroactively to individuals you invite
also who invited who, and maybe the highest form of cultural recognition would be "who influenced you the most into joining" and maybe you can have points that you ditribute between all of the major influences - a recruitment/convert lineage of some sorts

A public list of who has signed up for this system

Strategy: use platform APIs to link web2 platform accounts to a headjack account for a gradual transition - as an overlay
Adapters for current web2 platforma - wrap actions in messages that point to the web2 platform?

Strategy: donate money from the start, gain status and have your “share” of the company be donated to a collective process

strategy: start it centralized !!! Emulate the blockchain !!!

Strategy: let people help with the global brain - gaining reputation in return

strategy: We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point

We’re doing an uncapped and perpetuating open financing round

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

strategy: dogfooding the system - piping every aspect/argument/assumption of the vision through the collective sensemaking system as soon as possible and allowing for iteration on every aspect of it

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

The Liminal Web as the first target group for this project

We can export stackexchange karma through some onboarding strategy

The MVP Is Collective Capital Formation

Feed the entire book in an AI and make that easily accessible for people to prompt and ask interactively


“Talk to an AI about this book or about different chapters/sections of it”



call to action for people who watch the "solving the metacrisis" playlist: sign up for the project, spread the word, etc.

Include a way for people to add their email as early converts and put their counter globally somewhere - visibly online - up to date

- the OAuth-like experience - a major selling point, web2 feel

https://spec.dsnp.org/Roadmap.html

the only web3 identity/social solution that can partner with OAuth/OpenID - and they will signal-boost it

- an open source "twitter core" so that others can spin up competing applications easily

- incentive to be earlier in the system - lower index proves that

- tooling to extract/export/migrate social connections & IDs from other networks?
    https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/social-verifier

- integration guides & tooling for other platforms

- talk at conferences

- countering the "if we build it - they will come" wishful thinking with specifics

The goal is for this idea to spread by word of mouth
the goal of this project is to be something that anyone should want and should cheer it to succeed - & funding it eagerly - the objections should be way fewer than the arguments in support once fully understood - spread by word of mouth

- partner with

- status
Headjack - having a lower ID
market emerge around FIDs (@farcaster_xyz IDs) on farquest

after the right abstractions are picked, new use cases will be rapidly tested by different ways to compose the building blocks

plugins for automating the translation of posting on normal social media to translating into this new ecosystem

This is the next logical step for apple - to adopt the ultimate identity network of the world for AppleID
The ultimate appleId that spans even across every aspect of the global brain
what should these orgs do:
- facebook - the reason that facebook will not exist if it doesn't change is because it's not serving people and eventually something better will come along and consume it. In this case it's an ideology and an open ecosystem of protocols and incentives - join or perish
- instagram
- Apple
- Epic Games, Valve, Discord
"All your identities are belong to us" - the inevitability of this ecosystem swallowing all current identity providers and forcing them to migrate to it

Governing google properly

Comics po knigata - za vseki chapter/section



summoning the GB as a ritual - until self-reference is achieved ala Hofstadter's strange loop thingie

Public tweeting of claiming to want to sign up in the system - and rewarding you for being early. Telling your friends to also read it and tweet it is a competitive advantage - it is a form of caring to share with your friends to be early in the next game of humanity

dogfeeding the system: how to get most issues from "the listening society" & "nordic ideology" books into this system?

Can this be funded like star citizen?

Reading this book constitutes initiation into the parallel society

The MVP is deduplicatiom together with relevance aka ranking/sorting and aggregating
Minimum viable hivemind


Explain why the next version of the book is more important than me coding - because this is the fastest way possible to disseminate the best possible course of action

# the next version of this book (not a volume 2 but a next integrated version)

And explain how version 2 will be produced and what to expect in ingesting the next set of ideas most optimally - the diff, the ability to compare whats new and whats changed and make that as easy for navigation as possible - explaining the evolutionary architecture pf the next bible
Explain how the plan os for this book to end up being encoded into the global brain as evolving weights and that this is genesis - the seed
Genesis
The seed - as titles
Why rush version 1? Because we literally dont have time and every second counts and because there will be a version 3 and because eventually all of this will end up as weights in the global brain




# The role for artists

- distill whatever concepts you like from this book and make educational and viral materials - be it text, songs, drawings, graphs. And make them on multiple levels of abstraction so that they're approachable by anyone no matter their preparation. We'll be able to rate them
The role for artists - what types of memes and how we’re gonna rate them according to what we want to see in the world
!!! make tiktok dances about multipolar traps and tragedies of the commons and collective intelligence

Yo Fred, hit us up!

We have sympathy for VCs... most of them miss most of the generational companies and we wanted to make it easy for them - to make it glaringly obvious - that this is a good bet to make. Hence this book. You're welcome.
If you're a VC and you don't participate in any way, shape, or form in this new paradigm/ecosystem - you're NGMI.

come wet your beaks! go all in!

# geopolitics

The first countries to utilize this architecture will be the biggest winners.

The US should instantly dump a few hundred thousand billion for building this and passing the money through its emergent incentive structure.

The greatest game theoretic experiment is how quickly nations will realize that this is the future. The first will simply become the best in governance at all - and they will demonstrate it and will get pushed higher in status and exposure and expertise in collective optimality
The game is on









Oauth as a partner

plan how to enable current websites to gradually migrate to this shared identity layer and data exportability & interoperability

“The open source company”
We do not have enough of a team but will fund the most capable ones who wosh to build - there is plenty of room to capture value - the pie is big enough
We can collectively build this thing in parallel

we're not simply raising capital to build the whole thing on our own - we want to actively fund those that are best fit to compete in this new market. We are a fund as well.

auction the first 10k indexes in different tiers and raise funds

Make it so that people can publicly signal that they are currently reading it
also when they're finished reading it - to signal how much they liked it, etc.
also signal: yes i have a local copy of the book and am ready to share

- bootstrapping with ppl will be the hardest problem actually.
    - developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset & how to attract influencers.

TODO: think about
- tech talent
- growth strategy
- do a table with different groups & types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted

having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass
TODO: this goes in the growth strat!


think about a migration strategy for twitter


How do we get 1m people to have read this in 1 year and a billion in 10 years?

Block hash of “on brink of second bailout for banks”

The two genesis “blocks”/CIDs
Genesis pair
Genesis triplet

Timestamp the stone tablet selfie as an NFT with a 5-10% royalty on each resale
ConstitutionDAO raised 47$ million - this could eventually top that

Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) hash chains cannot be self-referential and have loops

also put the bitcoin genesis block hash on there with 15 or 16 AS (after satoshi)

The story of the story is the story

Evolution is the story
This book contains the full history and evolution of a stream of consciousness dumped in a text editor and git

> "We are not arguing that Bitcoin is infallible. We are arguing that it is the best technology yet invented for recording human history. And if the concept of cryptocurrency can endure past the invention of quantum decryption, we will likely think of the beginning of cryptographically verifiable history as on par with the beginning of written history millennia ago. Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD as the year 13 AS, with “After Satoshi” as the new “Anno Domini,” and the [block clock](https://blockclockmini.com/) as the new universal time." - [The Network State, by Balaji Srinivasan](https://thenetworkstate.com/microhistory-and-macrohistory#:~:text=we%20are%20not,new%20universal%20time.)

Humanity’s constitution of the 21st century is the global brain as a participatory social system - if the constitutionDAO raised 40 mil then this ought to deserve at least 10 mil even in the early stages
And unlike the constitution there will only be one copy of this NFT - just one.
The american constitution is in the process of crumbling under the weight of exponential complexity and entropy - what’s the price of a 0-to-1 upgrade of it that encompasses all of humanity and is unique?

Hash the book and put it on the stone tablet - then hash the photo and put its hash on. The blockchain
