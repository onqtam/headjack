# Go to market & growth strategy

- first 1k/10k indexes reserved & given with auctions/randomly to influential ppl
    - elon could get index 42 - the answer to the universe

growth hack: show some badge who invited you to the network (and how many people you have invited) - perhaps with some referral link initially?

Strategy: use platform APIs to link web2 platform accounts to a headjack account for a gradual transition - as an overlay
Adapters for current web2 platforma - wrap actions in messages that point to the web2 platform?

Strategy: donate money from the start, gain status and have your “share” of the company be donated to a collective process

strategy: start it centralized !!! Emulate the blockchain !!!

strategy: referral links and giving status retroactively to individuals you invite 

Strategy: let people help with the global brain - gaining reputation in return

strategy: We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

strategy: dogfooding the system - piping every aspect/argument/assumption of the vision through the collective sensemaking system as soon as possible and allowing for iteration on every aspect of it

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

The Liminal Web as the first target group for this project

We can export stackexchange karma through some onboarding strategy

call to action for people who watch the "solving the metacrisis" playlist: sign up for the project, spread the word, etc.

Include a way for people to add their email as early converts and put their counter globally somewhere - visibly online - up to date

- the OAuth-like experience - a major selling point, web2 feel

https://spec.dsnp.org/Roadmap.html

the only web3 identity/social solution that can partner with OAuth/OpenID - and they will signal-boost it

- an open source "twitter core" so that others can spin up competing applications easily

- incentive to be earlier in the system - lower index proves that

- tooling to extract/export/migrate social connections & IDs from other networks?
    https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/social-verifier

- integration guides & tooling for other platforms

- talk at conferences

- countering the "if we build it - they will come" wishful thinking with specifics

The goal is for this idea to spread by word of mouth
the goal of this project is to be something that anyone should want and should cheer it to succeed - & funding it eagerly - the objections should be way fewer than the arguments in support once fully understood - spread by word of mouth

after the right abstractions are picked, new use cases will be rapidly tested by different ways to compose the building blocks

Oauth as a partner

plan how to enable current websites to gradually migrate to this shared identity layer and data exportability & interoperability

“The open source company”
We do not have enough of a team but will fund the most capable ones who wosh to build - there is plenty of room to capture value - the pie is big enough
We can collectively build this thing in parallel

we're not simply raising capital to build the whole thing on our own - we want to actively fund those that are best fit to compete in this new market. We are a fund as well.

auction the first 10k indexes in different tiers and raise funds

- bootstrapping with ppl will be the hardest problem actually.
    - developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset & how to attract influencers.

TODO: think about
- tech talent
- growth strategy
- do a table with different groups & types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted

having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass
TODO: this goes in the growth strat!


think about a migration strategy for twitter

Whitepaper (+ brainstorming with some giga brains)
Funding, operations (legal, accounting, tokenomics), hiring
In parallel:
    Blockchain
    Block Graph explorer
    OAuth-like service (SSO)
    Defining a set of messages (post, reply, repost, like, etc).
        Based on existing standards & data models - ActivityPub
    Open source Twitter core (a centralized Twitter implementation)
    A for-profit Twitter clone utilizing the core
    Other types of for-profit applications - unpinch?
    Talking to other platforms & partnerships - Odysee, etc.
