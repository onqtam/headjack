# Go to market & growth strategy

- first 1k/10k indexes reserved & given with auctions/randomly to influential ppl
    - elon could get index 42 - the answer to the universe

growth hack: show some badge who invited you to the network (and how many people you have invited) - perhaps with some referral link initially?

Strategy: use platform APIs to link web2 platform accounts to a headjack account for a gradual transition - as an overlay
Adapters for current web2 platforma - wrap actions in messages that point to the web2 platform?

Strategy: donate money from the start, gain status and have your “share” of the company be donated to a collective process

strategy: start it centralized !!! Emulate the blockchain !!!

strategy: referral links and giving status retroactively to individuals you invite 

Strategy: let people help with the global brain - gaining reputation in return

strategy: We could individually give 100 “credit boost” credits initially so we can directly port our current importance graph that we all contain in our heads. The great reset - bootstrapping a brand new importance graph as a starting point

We’re doing an uncapped and perpetuating open financing round

strategy:
we can "import" a part of the web simply by making entries with a message type with an external URI pointing to a traditional page and then allow for commenting and voting and whatnot

strategy: dogfooding the system - piping every aspect/argument/assumption of the vision through the collective sensemaking system as soon as possible and allowing for iteration on every aspect of it

Chapter about what twitter should do with headjack - play on their infra skills and capture the AWS-like part of the future business ecosystem because its a nobrainer and they have expertise

The Liminal Web as the first target group for this project

We can export stackexchange karma through some onboarding strategy

call to action for people who watch the "solving the metacrisis" playlist: sign up for the project, spread the word, etc.

Include a way for people to add their email as early converts and put their counter globally somewhere - visibly online - up to date

- the OAuth-like experience - a major selling point, web2 feel

https://spec.dsnp.org/Roadmap.html

the only web3 identity/social solution that can partner with OAuth/OpenID - and they will signal-boost it

- an open source "twitter core" so that others can spin up competing applications easily

- incentive to be earlier in the system - lower index proves that

- tooling to extract/export/migrate social connections & IDs from other networks?
    https://github.com/cyberconnecthq/social-verifier

- integration guides & tooling for other platforms

- talk at conferences

- countering the "if we build it - they will come" wishful thinking with specifics

The goal is for this idea to spread by word of mouth
the goal of this project is to be something that anyone should want and should cheer it to succeed - & funding it eagerly - the objections should be way fewer than the arguments in support once fully understood - spread by word of mouth

Headjack - having a lower ID

after the right abstractions are picked, new use cases will be rapidly tested by different ways to compose the building blocks


This is the next logical step for apple - to adopt the ultimate identity network of the world for AppleID
The ultimate appleId that spans even across every aspect of the global brain
Here is what facebook should do
Here is what insta


Comics po knigata - za vseki chapter/section


A public list of who has signed up for this system

summoning the GB as a ritual - until self-reference is achieved ala Hofstadter's strange loop thingie

Public tweeting of claiming to want to sign up in the system - and rewarding you for being early. Telling your friends to also read it and tweet it is a competitive advantage - it is a form of caring to share with your friends to be early in the next game of humanity

Oauth as a partner

plan how to enable current websites to gradually migrate to this shared identity layer and data exportability & interoperability

“The open source company”
We do not have enough of a team but will fund the most capable ones who wosh to build - there is plenty of room to capture value - the pie is big enough
We can collectively build this thing in parallel

we're not simply raising capital to build the whole thing on our own - we want to actively fund those that are best fit to compete in this new market. We are a fund as well.

auction the first 10k indexes in different tiers and raise funds

- bootstrapping with ppl will be the hardest problem actually.
    - developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset & how to attract influencers.

TODO: think about
- tech talent
- growth strategy
- do a table with different groups & types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted

having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass
TODO: this goes in the growth strat!


think about a migration strategy for twitter


How do we get 1m people to have read this in 1 year and a billion in 10 years?

# SECTION: STONE TABLET IPFS CID HASH OF BOOK
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████


> "Behind this *~~mask~~* **hash** there is more than just *~~flesh~~* **words**. Beneath this *~~mask~~* **hash** there is an idea... and ideas are bulletproof." - [V](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/102108-behind-this-mask-there-is-more-than-just-flesh-beneath), probably

Prev:
Block hash of “on brink of second bailout for banks”

The two genesis “blocks”/CIDs
Genesis pair
Genesis triplet

Timestamp the stone tablet selfie as an NFT with a 5-10% royalty on each resale
ConstitutionDAO raised 47$ million - this could eventually top that

Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) hash chains cannot be self-referential and have loops

also put the bitcoin genesis block hash on there with 15 or 16 AS (after satoshi)

The story of the story is the story

Evolution is the story
This book contains the full history and evolution of a stream of consciousness dumped in a text editor and git

> "We are not arguing that Bitcoin is infallible. We are arguing that it is the best technology yet invented for recording human history. And if the concept of cryptocurrency can endure past the invention of quantum decryption, we will likely think of the beginning of cryptographically verifiable history as on par with the beginning of written history millennia ago. Future societies may think of the year 2022 AD as the year 13 AS, with “After Satoshi” as the new “Anno Domini,” and the [block clock](https://blockclockmini.com/) as the new universal time." - [The Network State, by Balaji Srinivasan](https://thenetworkstate.com/microhistory-and-macrohistory#:~:text=we%20are%20not,new%20universal%20time.)

Humanity’s constitution of the 21st century is the global brain as a participatory social system - if the constitutionDAO raised 40 mil then this ought to deserve at least 10 mil even in the early stages
And unlike the constitution there will only be one copy of this NFT - just one.
The american constitution is in the process of crumbling under the weight of exponential complexity and entropy - what’s the price of a 0-to-1 upgrade of it that encompasses all of humanity and is unique?

Hash the book and put it on the stone tablet - then hash the photo and put its hash on. The blockchain

██████ The 10 themes of the Global Brain:

- 1) EPISTEMICS - humility, error correction & Bayesian inference
- 2) INFORMATION - transparency, openness, provenance & integration
- 3) STRUCTURE - self-organization, emergence & subsidiarity
- 4) ALIGNMENT - incentives, reputation & consequence capture
- 5) DECISIONS - relevance realization & collective intelligence
- 6) ATTENTION - availability cascades & The Medium is the Message
- 7) SYSTEMICS - complexity, feedback, causality & adaptation
- 8) MEANING - shared intentionality, service & beating entropy
- 9) DIRECTION - greater scales of cooperation & evolvability
- 10) TRANSCENDENCE - Know Thyself & conscious evolution
