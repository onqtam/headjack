The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy

In game theory, the price of stability (PoS) of a game is the ratio between the best objective function value of one of its equilibria and that of an optimal outcome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_stability

The concepts of price of anarchy and price of stability were introduced to capture the loss in performance of a system due to the selfish behavior of its participants. The price of anarchy captures the worst-case performance of the system at equilibrium relative to the optimal performance possible. The price of stability, on the other hand, captures the relative performance of the best equilibrium of the system.

> "Take the case of academic publishing, given as a classic coordination failure by Eliezer Yudkowsky in Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck. Academic journals publish research within a given field and charge for access to it, often at exorbitant rates. In order to get the best jobs and earn prestige within a field, researchers need to publish in the most respected journals. If they don’t, no one will take their work seriously.
>
> Academic publishing is broken in many ways. By charging high prices, journals limit the flow of knowledge and slow scientific progress. They do little to help researchers, instead profiting from the work of volunteers and taxpayer funding. Yet researchers continue to submit their work to them. Why? Because this is the Nash equilibrium. Although it would be better for science as a whole if everyone stopped publishing in journals that charge for access, it isn’t in the interests of any individual scientist to do so. If they did, their career would suffer and most likely end. The only solution would be a coordinated effort for everyone to move away from journals. But seeing as this is so difficult to organize, the farce of academic publishing continues, harming everyone except the journals." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=Take%20the%20case,except%20the%20journals.)

> "In other words, cooperation in groups on a genetic basis tends to be self-destructive. This may be clarified by introducing the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy. The strategy of the altruists, helping others even if they do not reciprocate the help, may lead to an increased fitness for the group but it is not stable, since it can be easily invaded by egoistic strategies that take advantage of the altruists' sacrifice, but without giving anything in return. Though the selfish strategies will globally lead to a decrease of fitness for the group, they are locally stronger than the altruist strategies. This is another expression of the principle of suboptimization: genetic evolution works at the level of the subsystem (the individual or the individual together with his kin), and what is optimal at that level will be selected, even though it is far from optimal at the level of the group. Campbell has summed up this predicament by the phrase "genetic competition among the cooperators": on the level of the genes rivalry continues, and that will eventually erode any cooperation on the level of the group." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Selection for reciprocal altruism
>
> The characteristics of "tit for tat" (and of the other more successful strategies) can be summarized by three concepts: 1) the strategy is "nice": this means that it will never be the first to defect; 2) the strategy is "provocable": if the opponent defects, it retaliates by defecting too; 3) the strategy is "forgiving": as soon as the opponent cooperates again, the strategy forgets about the previous defection, and cooperates.
>
> Niceness is advantageous because it opens the way to mutually beneficial cooperation. Retaliation is necessary in order to avoid being invaded by selfish profiteers. Forgivingness has the advantage of avoiding mutual rounds of retaliation. Indeed, suppose that an individual because of distrust, by way of test or just because of a misunderstanding would defect just once, then a non- forgiving strategy would continue to defect in reaction, and mutual cooperation could never emerge or be restored.
>
> In a second study Axelrod generalized his game theoretic simulation to an evolutionary setting. In this setting, fitness was explicitly introduced by giving a strategy an amount of offspring proportional to the number of points it got in the previous tournament. The tournament was then repeated by playing all members of the new population of strategies (in which more successful strategies were now more numerous) against each other. Again the points of this tournament were used to produce a second generation of offspring. This generation played a following tournament, and so on. After many generations the less successful strategies would have been eliminated by natural selection, while the most successful ones would become more and more numerous. This setting is not equivalent to the previous one, since the fitness of the strategies depends on the opponents against which they play, and the field of opponents changes in the course of the simulated evolution. Hence a strategy that is successful in the original field of opponents may no longer be fit after the field has drastically changed. Yet Axelrod found out that it was still "tit for tat" that was most successful.
>
> However, "tit for tat" does not turn out to be an evolutionary stable strategy in the strict sense. Indeed, once the field is dominated by "tit for tat", other strategies that are less retaliatory (or more forgiving) become as fit as "tit for tat" since there are no longer cheaters to take advantage from their unconditional altruism. However, once a sufficient percentage of strategies becomes too altruistic, selfish strategies can again gain in fitness by exploiting their altruism. The end result seems to be some kind of equilibrium mixture of strategies in which reciprocal altruists such as "tit for tat" dominate, but in which there may also appear small amounts of "nasty" (the opposite of "nice") strategies together with non-retaliating altruists.
>
> In how far can these simulation results be generalized to real evolution? The most important restriction in the experiment seems to be that opponents interact with each other for a long, consecutive sequence of exchanges. This may be true for two individuals engaged in a close and stable relation. Reciprocal altruism may thus explain how a symbiotic relationship between two organisms can develop (e.g. a hermit crab and the sea anemone living on its shell) (cf. Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). In the kind of situations involving a large number of individuals that interest us, on the other hand, it seems more likely that opponents will encounter each other only once, or now and then with long interruptions and exchanges with different opponents in between.
>
> "Tit for tat" is only successful in an indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. If there is only one transaction, no retaliation is possible afterwards, and rationality dictates that you should defect. If there is a finite number of transactions, it pays to defect during the last one, but if you expect your opponent to defect at the last one, you should also defect at the last-but-one, and hence your opponent would be wise to already defect at the last-but-two, and so on. Hence games with a fixed number (known by the participants) of transactions would lead to continuous defection. In practice, that does not seem to be the problem, since normally opponents do not know how often they will meet each other again.

> However, the basic practical limitation is that of memory: the reciprocal altruist should not only remember how his opponent treated him during the last transaction (which may be a long time ago) he should also be able to recognize and distinguish all opponents with whom he has ever had transactions. This requirement does not seem to be realistic in large groups, such as human societies. Moreover, in such large systems, many encounters will take place for the first (and perhaps the last) time. In such cases reciprocal altruism does no good, and the "nice" individual who starts by cooperating may be cheated most of the time by others he will never see again. When I buy something in a shop in a city where I will never come back again, I do not expect to be cheated (though that is possible of course), even though I have no power to retaliate. In conclusion, reciprocal altruism seems still insufficient to explain the ultrasociality of human society." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The basic weakness of reciprocal altruism in explaining ultrasociality is that it starts from dyadic relationships, of the type "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine". It is difficult to imagine how such one-to-one exchanges could be enlarged in order to form the basis for large collective organizations. Therefore we would like to see some evolutionary stable strategy that directs behaviour towards groups rather than towards other individuals.
>
> It has been proposed that one such strategy is moralism, that is to say behavior that rewards or reinforces altruistic behavior by others, and punishes or inhibits cheating or defection. For example, Trivers (1971) has postulated selection for "moralistic aggression", and Lorenz (1975) speaks about "innate ethical sense". The advantage of moralism compared to pure altruism is that the costs of moralizing towards others are clearly less than those of being altruistic yourself (Campbell, 1983). However, if everybody around you is continuously moralizing, and ready to ostracize or even kill you if you do not behave altruistically, it becomes quite difficult to behave in a selfish way. Hence groups consisting of moralizing individuals will also tend to be altruistic, though the individuals are not motivated to be altruistic on their own. Moralism is also more stable than real altruism because cheaters will find it very difficult to invade a population that tends to make their life as difficult as possible. A disadvantage of moralism is that it encourages hypocrisy, that is to say behavior that does everything to look altruistic but is in fact selfish.
>
> A basic weakness of the argument is that it is difficult to imagine how something as complicated as an "ethical sense" might develop through genetic evolution. It seems quite difficult to put down rules distinguishing moral or altruistic behavior from selfish behavior that are applicable to all situations and all individuals. We might perhaps imagine the evolution of simple behavior patterns such as aggressive reactions against the selfish wolf who does not want the others of the pack to share in the food, but that does not seem sufficient to explain ultrasociality.
>
> Another weakness of the moralistic selection argument, is that moralism mainly functions to maintain an already functioning cooperation system, by reducing the fitness of those who do not obey the rules. However, the argument does not explain how the cooperative pattern, and the moralistic attitude that maintains it, may have developed from selfish behavior in the first place." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The theory of natural selection on the basis of fitness is in principle applicable to all replicating systems, not only to genes. Recently, a new type of replicator has been proposed as a unit of cultural evolution. Memes are defined as cognitive or behavioral patterns that can be transmitted from one individual to another one by learning and imitation (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz, 1991). Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society, almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language, fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts, conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any replication at the level of the genes. Storing a concept or a habit in memory after having encountered it through another individual, does not require any change of the DNA." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Though that process will be subjected to the same basic principles of blind variation and natural selection on the basis of fitness, memetic evolution is basically a much more flexible mechanism. Genes can only be transmitted from parents (or parent in the case of asexual reproduction) to offspring. Memes can in principle be transmitted between any two individuals (though it will become more difficult the larger the differences in cognitive mechanisms and language are).
>
> For genes to be transmitted, you typically need one generation, which for higher organism means several years. Memes can be transmitted in the space of hours. Meme spreading is also much faster than gene spreading, because gene replication is restricted by the rather small number of offspring a single parent can have, whereas the amount of individuals that can take over a meme from a single individual is almost unlimited. Moreover, it seems much easier for memes to undergo variation, since the information in the nervous system is more plastic than that in the DNA, and since individuals can come into contact with much more different sources of novel memes. On the other hand, selection processes can be more efficient because of "vicarious" selection: the meme carrier himself does not need to be killed in order to eliminate an inadequate meme; it can suffice that he witnesses or hears about the troubles of another individual due to that same meme.
>
> The conclusion is that memetic evolution will be several orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than genetic evolution. It should not surprise us then that during the last ten thousand years, humans have almost not changed on the genetic level, whereas their culture (i.e. the total set of memes) has undergone the most radical developments. In practice the superior "evolvability" of memes would also mean that in cases where genetic and memetic replicators are in competition, we would expect the memes to win in the long term, even though the genes would start with the advantage of a well- established, stable structure." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Meme fitness will depend basically on three factors: 1) survivability of the carrier; 2) individual learnability of memes; 3) tendency of memes to spread or to be transmitted. The first criterion is similar to the one determining gene selection, so we won't go into much detail about it. Basically it states that, all other things being equal, memes leading to decreased probability of a carrier's survival, e.g. because they are bad for the health, or lead to dangerous or suicidal behavior, will tend to be eliminated. However, we must add that survival is to be interpreted on the level of the group of all carriers, rather than on the level of the individual." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is this contagiousness that most strikingly differentiates meme selection from gene selection. Genes, indeed, are not contagious. You can never get a gene, that you did not already have, from someone else. At most you can produce a child that shares some of your genes with some genes of another person." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "All memes have the implicit goal of making their carriers more fit, since an increased number of carriers signifies that there will be more memory space available for meme replication. If, as we have argued previously, cooperation among the carriers tends to increase the overall fitness of the group of carriers, it will be in the interest of memes to promote that cooperation. Moreover, since cooperation requires communication, and since meme spreading critically depends on communication, the "motivation" of memes to bolster cooperation should be even stronger than that of genes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The selective advantage does not mean that the less fit group will be physically eliminated during the competition with the cooperative group. On the level of memes, elimination can happen when the selfish group gives up its belief in the meme for selfishness and adopts the meme for altruism from the other group. This conversion of one group by another one may happen by direct physical force, for example because the altruist group is better organized to win a war between the groups, and can thus subdue the other one. It can also happen in a peaceful way because the less successful group simply imitates the more successful one.
>
> The basic argument against group selection is that group strategies can be easily invaded. However, that is not the case for memetic strategies. Indeed, suppose that a "mutant" meme promoting selfishness would appear in an altruist group. According to genetic reasoning, its carrier would be more fit than an altruist one, since he can profit from the altruism of the other carriers without paying the corresponding costs. However, the fitness of a meme is different from the fitness of its carrier. Though the selfish carrier might have enhanced fitness in the sense that he gets more food or other resources, the fitness of the meme he carries depends on how easily other members of the group can be converted to it.
>
> Now memes are selfish, which means that they have the implicit goal of thwarting all rival memes that compete for the same memory space. Hence the majority meme in the group will tend to consolidate the memory space it already occupies in the majority of carriers. A likely mechanism for that might be that the different carriers continuously reinforce each other's belief by communication and imitation. The carrier of the mutant meme, on the other hand, is alone and does not get any reinforcement from his fellows. He will find it very difficult to convert any of them to his non-conformist ideas, since the influence on any individual of a majority of conformists will be much stronger than that of a single dissident. This tendency of the majority meme to impose itself on minorities leads to intra-group homogeneity, as confirmed by Boyd and Richerson's (1985) mathematical model of cultural evolution" - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Memes will even succeed in transcending the problem of the genetic competition between the cooperators... Our criticism of the argument on the basis of moralism, namely that a complete ethical system seems too complex to evolve by genetic selection, does not apply to memetic evolution, which is much faster, and which adapts more readily to abstract models of the world." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "When two individuals, after sufficient interactions, have reached a stable cooperative relationship or pact, based on reciprocity, that agreement or convention can be viewed as a meme with two carriers. If there is communication, that same meme can be transferred to a third and a fourth carrier, and so on, who would thus come to join the convention. Indeed, an individual who observes an existing reciprocal relationship between two other individuals, and who notices the advantages following from their mutual cooperation, would be tempted to imitate their behavior. If a certain behavioral pattern tends to be imitated, that makes it a meme by definition. If that meme, in addition to it being contagious, also furthers the genetic fitness of its carriers, we may conclude that it has a high memetic fitness, and thus will tend to replace rival memes with a lower fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The limitations on memory that make reciprocity difficult for large groups, can also be evaded by memetic mechanisms. Indeed, a meme can easily evolve mechanisms for making members of the same cultural group easy to recognize. Individuals belonging to the same culture or ethnical group will usually distinguish themselves by clearly perceivable attributes or behavior... If such signs allow you to identify a member of your group, you can expect that he will also follow the group's agreement on reciprocity, and hence you can trust that he will cooperate, without you having to renegotiate a pact. If he does not, you can still alarm the other members of your group, and he will be subjected to moralistic aggression. In that sense it is to the advantage of both the group and separate individuals to wear the appropriate attributes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Many ethical systems explicitly refer to the ideal of "fraternity", and sometimes members of the same cultural group (e.g. monks or Freemasons) are supposed to call each other "brother". Though these are not brothers in the biological sense, the meme attempts to harness the innate tendency to behave altruistically towards kin and to use it for purposes different from the increase of genetic inclusive fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is possible to discern a clear progression from pure selfishness, to kin-restricted limited altruism, to "tit for tat" based dyads, to multi-individual reciprocal agreements, to moralism and group ideologies, and finally to the complex ultrasocial systems of cooperation characterizing present society." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "With the capacity for language appears the capacity to rapidly spread complex memes, and that gives memes a definite advantage over genes in directing further evolution. In recent times, the memes that seem to be dominating are those that tend to make the ideal of altruism or brotherliness universal, ignoring the distinctions created by older memes such as languages or religions. We will not go into detail about why that is happening but note that the evolutionary tendency towards more and more far-reaching or inclusive cooperation seems to continue, albeit with many ups and downs. Such an evolution towards stronger integration of subsystems, allowing optimization at the global level, is exemplified by Turchin's concept of a metasystem transition. Such an evolutionary transition is characterized by the appearance of a control system at the metalevel, steering and optimizing the actions of the subsystems at the level below." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "A basic conclusion of our general analysis is that you need communication before you can have cooperation, that is to say information must be shared. In organisms cooperating because of kin selection, the medium of communication is sexual reproduction: genetic "messages" are transmitted through special cells (sperm or egg cells) that cannot survive or develop independently of the process of sexual reproduction. It is this shared information that creates the connection between parents and offspring or, indirectly, between relatives. In primitive multicellular organisms, such as algae, the "communication" might be based on simple spatial contiguity (sharing of the same location). In complex organisms where there is differentiation of functions among cells, you need special chemical signals to coordinate the different cells (this can be modelled by "genetic networks", Kauffmann, 1991). In sociocultural systems, the basic medium supporting cooperation is meme spreading." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The complete evolutionary sequence would be something of the following form: competition, communication, stable interaction patterns, internal models of pattern, shared models, shared replicators, cooperation promoted by shared replicators, integration with the shared replicators as coordinators. In Turchin's terminology, the shared information will become a control for the systems of the level below, coordinating, monitoring and directing their cooperation. Hence the process of development of cooperation between initially competing subsystems through the development of shared replicators can be seen as a true metasystem transition." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is clear that the whole issue of how competing subsystems can start to cooperate and thus become (partly or completely) integrated into a globally optimizing supersystem is very complex. Many questions about cooperation, shared information, and higher levels of control still have to be answered. Yet I think it is equally obvious that these problems are of the utmost importance if we wish to understand our own further evolution, as individuals, as a species, as a culture, or as parts of the global world system." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)
