> "Nature promotes cooperation, collaboration, and synergy because it is thermodynamically beneficial for all parties, and for that reason, synergistic collective configurations will eventually be discovered by any many-component system that is exploring various states or configurations through the blind-variation-and-selective-retention mechanism. Organisms only compete until they finally figure out that working together makes everyone’s task easier, and that goes for humans too." - [Bobby Azarian]()

> "Just as blueprints don't necessarily specify blue buildings, selfish genes don't necessarily specify selfish organisms. As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain. Genes are a play within a play, not the interior monologue of the players." - [Steven pinker](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/122032-just-as-blueprints-don-t-necessarily-specify-blue-buildings-selfish-genes)


The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy

In game theory, the price of stability (PoS) of a game is the ratio between the best objective function value of one of its equilibria and that of an optimal outcome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_stability

The concepts of price of anarchy and price of stability were introduced to capture the loss in performance of a system due to the selfish behavior of its participants. The price of anarchy captures the worst-case performance of the system at equilibrium relative to the optimal performance possible. The price of stability, on the other hand, captures the relative performance of the best equilibrium of the system.

> "Take the case of academic publishing, given as a classic coordination failure by Eliezer Yudkowsky in Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck. Academic journals publish research within a given field and charge for access to it, often at exorbitant rates. In order to get the best jobs and earn prestige within a field, researchers need to publish in the most respected journals. If they don’t, no one will take their work seriously.
>
> Academic publishing is broken in many ways. By charging high prices, journals limit the flow of knowledge and slow scientific progress. They do little to help researchers, instead profiting from the work of volunteers and taxpayer funding. Yet researchers continue to submit their work to them. Why? Because this is the Nash equilibrium. Although it would be better for science as a whole if everyone stopped publishing in journals that charge for access, it isn’t in the interests of any individual scientist to do so. If they did, their career would suffer and most likely end. The only solution would be a coordinated effort for everyone to move away from journals. But seeing as this is so difficult to organize, the farce of academic publishing continues, harming everyone except the journals." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=Take%20the%20case,except%20the%20journals.)

> "It’s possible to change things on a large scale if we are able to communicate on a much greater scale. When everyone knows that everyone knows, changing what we do is much easier.
>
> We all act out of self-interest, so expecting individuals to risk the costs of going against convention is usually unreasonable. Yet it only takes a small proportion of people to change their opinions to reach a tipping point where there is strong incentive for everyone to change their behavior, and this is magnified even more if those people have a high degree of influence. The more power those who enact change have, the faster everyone else can do the same.
>
> To overcome coordination failures, we need to be able to communicate despite our differences. And we need to be able to trust that when we act, others will act too. The initial kick can be enough people making their actions visible. Groups can have exponentially greater impacts than individuals. We thus need to think beyond the impact of our own actions and consider what will happen when we act as part of a group." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20possible%20to,of%20a%20group.)

> "All human groups frown on, make pronouncements against, and punish the following: murder, undue use of authority, cheating that harms group cooperation, major lying, theft, and socially disruptive sexual behavior. These basic rules of conduct appear to be human universals." - [Christopher Boehm](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11025360-all-human-groups-frown-on-make-pronouncements-against-and-punish)

It also depends on whether people are aware that other people also receive it.” According to Suk-Young Chwe, for people to coordinate on the basis of certain information it must be “common knowledge,” a phrase used here to mean “everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows it, and so on.” The more public and visible the change is, the better." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=As%20Michael%20Suk,is%2C%20the%20better.)
