Accordingly, we plan for everything: social events, marriage, education, vacations, careers, health, war and even death. So why don’t we have a plan for the human race?

The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools.

> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

> "To me, the name “God” is an amazing name for all the dreams of humanity projected into one point. What would you name that? You would name it God. And that is what we need to do, to retake the “God” word but just give God proper qualities that we can actually believe in." - [Alexander Bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntheism#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20the%20name%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20is%20an%20amazing%20name%20for%20all%20the%20dreams%20of%20humanity%20projected%20into%20one%20point.%20What%20would%20you%20name%20that%3F%20You%20would%20name%20it%20God.%20And%20that%20is%20what%20we%20need%20to%20do%2C%20to%20retake%20the%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20word%20but%20just%20give%20God%20proper%20qualities%20that%20we%20can%20actually%20believe%20in.)


> "The Latin verb religare means to 're-bind'. The Latin noun religio referring to obligation, bond, or reverence is probably based on religare, so religio and its English derivation religion connote a 're-binding'." - [Peter Lucas Hulen on Religion](http://persweb.wabash.edu/facstaff/hulenp/religion.html#:~:text=The%20Latin%20verb%20religare%20means,a%20're%2Dbinding'.)

> "Syntheism is essentially idea that God is a good word to use, because God is the ultimate. And we have no better word for the ultimate. So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

> "I think the problem with the West that we're living with today is that exploitative behavior of the West across the world that caused the current problems was because state and market were left outside of religion." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=2799)
^^ Not sure about this...

> "We can plunder all the religious and philosophical history and check out what were the ideas that really survived what were ideas that were timeless and that turns out to be the ideas that concerned humans and what were the ideas that were time specific oh they turned out to be the the concern technology that concerned equality is like learning and reading and speaking and writing or whatever we humans do or artistic expression okay that's what changes over time now if we know that if you see that pattern we can then construct a value system that works for us today and because it concerns a new paradigm as nietzsche would say and we have a freedom then to be creative about this we call that process paradigmatics so what we're creating today is a system of values that work for us and that development is with metamodernism for example today's interest it is interested in what kind of values do we co-create here so we get the really creative discussion and conversation but also that the little genius among us that need their own space to work in the little monasteries to construct whatever they can construct can also do that and so we can also embrace that engineers and traders are creating enormous value and they need our support they might even need some kind of religious direction." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=4657)
