> "Because of the Existence Bias, for example, we don’t have a plan for the future of the human race. That’s odd, because our existence is built upon obsessive planning. It helps us get what we want. Accordingly, we plan for everything: social events, marriage, education, vacations, careers, health, war and even death. So why don’t we have a plan for the human race? Whether we like it or not, nearly 8 billion of us are interconnected, comprising a vast orchestra, each contributing to a collective fate." - [13 Steps to Cognitive “Perfection”, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/13-steps-to-cognitive-perfection-86e316569c3f#:~:text=Because%20of%20the,a%20collective%20fate.)

TODO: quote from here (from a teacher in NY) about how broken public schooling is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw
Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast
from minute 9:44 till 13:05

Its all about education - it never stops - not just 24 years - for life. For anything. At any time.

What if school work was not something that ends up thrown away but was aimed at contributing to society? What if all their work was meaningful and not thrown away once graded? They feel like their work is pointless & ineffectual. They're forced into non-seriousness. We're creating a kind of immaturity. (All thoughts from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast)

Harvard is a perverse concept

One upside of having kids learn & compete on serious real world issues in public building a track record is that by the time they're 25-30 they'll have more to show and prove than most 40-50 year olds and could make a serious claim to legitimacy in governance - a way to fix our gerintocracy.

The root of the metacrisis is an education crisis (Zak Stein)
also a legitimation & teacherly authority crisis - its not just a technological problem
Education is the autopoietic root of society - the way it propagates/maintains/reproduces itself

> "At its best, schooling can be about how to make a life, which is quite different from how to make a living." - [Neil Postman](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/234881)

> "Children enter school as question marks and leave as periods." - [Neil Postman](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/599276)

> "If students get a sound education in the history, social effects and psychological biases of technology, they may grow to be adults who use technology rather than be used by it." - [Neil Postman](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/843176)

> "There is no way to help a learner to be disciplined, active, and thoroughly engaged unless he perceives a problem to be a problem or whatever is to-be-learned as worth learning, and unless he plays an active role in determining the process of solution." - [Neil Postman](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1215352)

> "The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools. The right answer depends on two things, and two things alone: the existence of shared narratives and the capacity of such narratives to provide an inspired reason for schooling." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1364209-public-education-does-not-serve-a-public-it-creates-a#:~:text=The%20question%20is,reason%20for%20schooling.)

> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

> "Society in general, simply by its effect on men's minds, undoubtedly has all that is required to arouse the sensation of the divine. A society is to its members what a god is to its faithful.

> "A society whose members are united by the fact that they think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1204111)

> "Society is not a mere sum of individuals. Rather, the system formed by their association represents a specific reality which has its own characteristics... The group thinks, feels, and acts quite differently from the way in which its members would were they isolated. If, then, we begin with the individual, we shall be able to understand nothing of what takes place in the group." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/541413)

Michelangelo's ["The Creation of Adam"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam) depicts a [human brain behind God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam#Portrayal_of_the_human_brain) where he is held and uplifted by angels interwoven in their relationality. Coincidence?

OMEGA POINT STUFF BY BOBBY AZARIAN GOES HERE

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

> "If you and I are to live religious lives, it mustn't be that we talk a lot about religion, but that our manner of life is different. It is my belief that only if you try to be helpful to other people will you in the end find your way to God." - [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/80925-if-you-and-i-are-to-live-religious-lives-it)


How do we make sure we don't kill curiosity in kids? Make curiosity pay dividends - harness intelligence
We have generations of gamers - because there’s no alternative. We need to make God their playground and we would be the stewarts of it - generational transmission.

God is compassion
God is transparent. God is light. God is the sun

God is our civilization

God is the totality of human relationality - the glue that binds us together
interconnectedness, relations, intentions, hopes and dreams

God is the alignment protocol
God is the conscious alignment protocol

> "God is a human invented symbol is my belief - it's our most powerful symbol - it carries with it awe, reverence, respect. I propose to steal it with love." - [Stuart Kauffman](https://youtu.be/EjQCaC7JSMY?t=3931)

> "We no longer need the Creator God - we just need creativity." - [Gordon Kaufman](https://youtu.be/EjQCaC7JSMY?t=4035)

As long as there’s an argument to have a CIA we’ve not reached sustainability.

God is a mechanism and a direction. God is alignment. God is consequence capture. God is integrated information. God is connectedness. God is consciousness.

> "I suspect that we can reconstruct the concept of God as an entirely rational concept, as a global optimum of transcendent (emergent collective) agency, affording a space of justifiable vantage points that allow judging between the available event trajectories." - [Joscha Bach](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1729067903457366325)

God allows us to ask the question “What is my purpose” and then get an option along with a path for how to get there. You can get multiple options that are personalized to you

God is the search engine of meaning in life

The god of the 21st century is the most just of all

God is the planetary nervous system of humanity

(Sovereign) identity is the key to god

God is the fairness protocol

God is the purest form of cooperation - the most efficient one - achievable only with maximal alignment which requires trust through  transparency and reputation.

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

God is leaving the world better after yourself

We need something that would sell itself

God is a story and we can choose him

God is an attractor - an aspiration. God is always further - there’s always more to improve. God delivers protopia - by terhering our values as the source of everything for meaning

God is the answer to meaning - god is what we create. God is what we contribute to - that’s god. The evolution of culture - the human spirit

Enlightenment 1.0 killed god and the 2.0 version needs to reinvent him
Quote god is waiting at the bottom of the glass

God is the protocol ecosystem of cooperation and shared intentionality.
Creating god would ensure we hatch from Earth as an egg and secure the existence of life for as long as possible

> "The religious is the category in culture that is concerned with the fitness to purpose of human cultural environments." - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/SkHeudFqPnk?t=3616)


> "Syntheism is essentially idea that God is a good word to use, because God is the ultimate. And we have no better word for the ultimate. So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

> "I think the problem with the West that we're living with today is that exploitative behavior of the West across the world that caused the current problems was because state and market were left outside of religion." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=2799)
^^ Not sure about this...

> "We can plunder all the religious and philosophical history and check out what were the ideas that really survived what were ideas that were timeless and that turns out to be the ideas that concerned humans and what were the ideas that were time specific oh they turned out to be the the concern technology that concerned equality is like learning and reading and speaking and writing or whatever we humans do or artistic expression okay that's what changes over time now if we know that if you see that pattern we can then construct a value system that works for us today and because it concerns a new paradigm as nietzsche would say and we have a freedom then to be creative about this we call that process paradigmatics so what we're creating today is a system of values that work for us and that development is with metamodernism for example today's interest it is interested in what kind of values do we co-create here so we get the really creative discussion and conversation but also that the little genius among us that need their own space to work in the little monasteries to construct whatever they can construct can also do that and so we can also embrace that engineers and traders are creating enormous value and they need our support they might even need some kind of religious direction." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=4657)

> "Our point in offering this obviously oversimplified history is that our understanding of Religion today is very different from what it has been through the vast majority of human life. The problems this difference has led to are the key point of our blog. For most of human history, Religion was not merely a matter of worshipping supernatural gods. Rather, it provided what historian David Christian calls, in his book Origin Stories, a “shared map,” the myth by which members of a community could navigate our “rich, beautiful and sometimes terrifying universe.”
>
> This map enabled both individuals and societies to take on tasks such as developing a shared interpretation of the world, a common identity, and a set of behavioral standards. In fact, it was so deeply integrated into society that the first pre-modern scientists—the astronomers of Babylon and Egypt—were priests. “Religion” was not separate from the rest of social behavior; it provided the compass for that behavior." - [What Is Religion? How theism is different from religion, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/what-is-religion#:~:text=Our%20point%20in,for%20that%20behavior.)

A better term for this is theism, and we do not think it is wise to equate the concept of Religion to theism." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=Many%20in%20the%20West%20think%20of%20Religion%20in%20terms%20of%20believing%20in%20a%20supernatural%20God.%20A%20better%20term%20for%20this%20is%20theism%2C%20and%20we%20do%20not%20think%20it%20is%20wise%20to%20equate%20the%20concept%20of%20Religion%20to%20theism.)

> "To understand what we mean by mythos, we need to examine how the human brain organizes conscious experience around a symbolic order. Terrence Deacon calls this ordering the “defining attribute of human beings.” That symbolic order enables people in any community to interpret their world so that they can cooperate in meeting the deepest challenges to their survival. As a result, culture creates a shared virtual reality. The beliefs and values of any community emerge from their symbolic order, and, especially in pre-literate societies, that order is communicated in its mythos." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=To%20understand%20what,its%20mythos.)

> "Because people in any society are repeatedly exposed to their mythos and the rituals that celebrate it, they learn to think in the terms of their symbolic order and build institutions that reflect it." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=Because%20people%20in%20any%20society%20are%20repeatedly%20exposed%20to%20their%20mythos%20and%20the%20rituals%20that%20celebrate%20it%2C%20they%20learn%20to%20think%20in%20the%20terms%20of%20their%20symbolic%20order%20and%20build%20institutions%20that%20reflect%20it.)

> "People need a structure of understanding to explain both why things are the way they are and what is the right way to live, which are implied in their symbolic orders. As a result, they face at least two fundamental challenges—justifying what is the case and justifying what ought to be the case. We can call the first the problem of facts and the second the problem of values." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=people%20need%20a,problem%20of%20values.)

> "We can frame religion in terms of the belief-value networks that emerge from our symbolic orders and shape how we see and experience value in the universe, in our collective groups, and in our personal lives. It relates to what binds us together in a story, what gives meaningful shape to the cosmos, and what places us in a network with others that enables us to determine what is sacred or transcendent.
>
> This analysis allows us to see clearly why we are facing something of a meaning crisis, especially in the West. In concrete terms, the Christian justification system that emerged in Europe developed both a theistic Religion and a natural philosophy. However, as the natural philosophy grew into natural science, it generated a justification system that undermined a theistic worldview and its dual worlds of heaven and earth. Instead, what we were left with via science was a fairly cold description of “what is,” and essentially no justification system for what ought to be.
>
> We believe that humans need to have coherent justifications for both what is the case and what ought to be the case. We can see through the Greek terms “logos” and “mythos” that these are two different kinds of justifications, but we need them both. Science has given us a good way to develop our logos. However, it has not been framed in a way that also is conducive to cultivating a mythos that gives us a shared narrative for how we ought to live in the world. We believe this is one of the great tasks of this century." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=we%20can%20frame,of%20this%20century.)
