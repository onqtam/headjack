> "The FEP states that living organisms are dynamical systems that are separated from their environment by an interface. We will refer to these living organisms as ‘agents’ for the sake of convenience going forward, since all living organisms sense their environment and act in response to those sensations... Crucially, this interface separates both the environment from the agent and the agent from its surroundings, allowing it to exist as a self-contained and autonomous entity. Agents therefore always necessarily receive sensory information and act through this interface. They never have unmediated access to what is going on in the environment, and as a result always have to guess (or infer) what is the true state of the world based on the information they have access to. According to the FEP, all agents act, as best as they can, to minimize the errors in their guesses about the environment. These errors can be quantified by a metric called ‘free energy,’ and the better an agent can minimize it over time, the better chance the agent has of staying alive and maintaining itself. To understand it intuitively, think of free energy as a measure of surprise or uncertainty." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "The minimization of free energy is not an end in itself. It is ultimately in service of the maintenance of the agent as an individual separated from its environment. Agents do this by attempting to remain in a state of homeostasis. All living agents have some sense of what that homeostasis for them should be, even if it is only represented implicitly within the structure of the agent itself. In the same way that sensory prediction errors increase free energy, so do deviations from the desired homeostasis of the agent, as the homeostatic set points of an agent itself are another kind of prediction about the world." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "An interesting aspect of the FEP is that it can often produce behavior which paradoxically doesn’t seem like error minimization, at least in the short-term. Let’s imagine that someone moves to a new neighborhood they are unfamiliar with. They could choose to stay inside their new home, which would indeed allow them to minimize any prediction errors that would arise from the novel environment. On the other hand, they could go outside and explore their new surroundings. Doing the latter will produce many more short-term prediction errors. In the long run though it will allow them to avoid even bigger surprises in the future. It is this dynamic of long-term free energy minimization that can account for various forms of exploration, adventure, and industry which we are motivated to engage in." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "We humans distinguish ourselves from other living agents by our ability to not only react to the environment but also establish goals and then set out to accomplish them. This might seem to be a challenge for a theory which suggests that all behavior is in the service of entropy minimization, but the FEP accounts for this quite elegantly as well. In this view, when we set a goal for ourselves, we are making a special kind of prediction about the world. This prediction is one that we know goes against the current sensory evidence, thus increasing free energy. Instead of updating our beliefs to account for the world (and in essence give up on the goal), what we do instead is to set out to act in the world in order to ensure that the sensory evidence corresponds to our prediction, and minimize the free energy in the process... We make a prediction about how we would like the world to be, and then act in order to make that prediction come true." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "It blows my mind how few people in the business world presently see the value of tools capable of modeling and emulating the real time evolution of their causal domain in probabilistic terms, including the way in which their own actions are likely to change the playing field. They're so used to being spoon fed extremely reductive and lagging graphs and charts in .ppt format as reasonable models of their world, that the idea of continuous Socratic interaction with a "living" model comes across as an utterly alien value proposition. And yet that's exactly where things are heading..." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1753188223529230376)


> "Of course, our failures are a consequence of many factors, but possibly one of the most important is the fact that society operates on the theory that specialization is the key to success, not realizing that specialization precludes comprehensive thinking." - [R.

sunlight is the best disenfecatant
the fastest way for pro social behaviors is to make sure everyone's reputation is on the line

The role of something like change.org

your main job would be to be an annotator - such that you get scored based on performance

we need a shared view of reality and the ability to coordinate around that view of reality
we need social media that is rewarding synthesis of ideas
what if we rewarded those who find divisive fault lines and bridge the gap?


we need to enable freeform networking at scale in order to build a global brain - the host-centric model doesn't allow that - any type of data should be linkable & manipulatable with any other data type

high trust (social capital), shared stories & strong institutions - required for democracy, but social media is eroding them - Jonathan Haidt
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu2jprZ50FY

"We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology." - Edward O. Wilson

media tells us what is salient but we lack the tools to question the framing

we should strive to separate causal patterns from correlated patterns

== A self-organizing system - in the sensemaking chapter
we can achieve cycles of differentiation (random exploration) followed by convergence & integration to refine our collective model of reality in a self-organizing system - just like our minds work
complexification followed by iterative integration - assimilation & compression - calibration against the real world is the constant flux between the two
zooming in and zooming out
https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=3112
stark contrast - Compare that to what we currently have - attention-driven feedback loops of psychosis & epileptic seizures - we are unable to integrate the signal - we have no capacity to adaptively re-fit itself to the world
The internet is suffering from epilepsy
our current systems optimize for efficiency (attention capture) - not the evolvability of ideas
the host-centric model hinders our ability to develop the tools for integration - for interlinking & coming to consensus - we're given one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator functionality in the race to the bottom of the brain stem

we lack precision weighting of the signals ==> hence our psychosis

> "the function of consciousness is to do enhanced relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4094)

> "what consciousness is doing is higher-order relevance realization" - [source](https://youtu.be/IZ-tHaHfB8A?t=4199)

our capacity to pay attention in the right way was evolved - it is fundamentally an adaptive ability - it was selected for

building participatory governance at scale

distributed cognition or sensemaking?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition

we need to build a strong central nervous system for this global organism

current platforms constrain our global neural network from freely wiring - we're allowed a very limited set of wiring

we should be able to come to consensus about questions such as "how much cobalt goes into EVs, how much EVs are not using cobalt at all anymore, and where is cobalt coming from (hint: not just the congo)"

there should be something like twitter's community notes for any kind of media - not just tweets

anyone should be able to construct graph narratives by selecting "facts" which can be observed & pointed at

just like we have a mental model when doing searches that we can request results only from the last month, the same way we'll learn to think in terms of filters & slices

we have a distorted view of reality because of the vocal and dominant minority - what if we allowed people to express themselves in aggregate without the consequences?

a dynamical system theory lays out the engine - the feedback loop between generation and governance/integration
> "there is a systematic relationship between a set of enabling & selective constraints" - [John Vervaeke](https://youtu.be/A_gH5VIZO0Q&t=1985&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&index=8)

sensemaking is when the pattern in the world matches the pattern in our head. Through crowdsourcing we feed distributed data, and through the system and the ability to look at data & its analysis from different angles we allow for its integration. We look for intersubjective agreement AKA consensus
^^ this needs more work

We’ve never had a true social network
A true social network allows data, events and identities to be linked in any way imaginable - today’s platforms are a lowest common denominator with hard constraints on how they can be extended

a bottom-up global governance system can only be built on top of a shared identity layer, trust, reputation & immutable history

empowerment - voter apathy is best explained by the disbelief that their vote would matter or that the pool of options is constrained and nothing is good enough.

"Second, we would see increased citizen engagement, a sense of ownership, and higher voting participation rates."


> "Even citizens who remained minimally politically engaged — perhaps just resetting their proxies in the main issue areas every year or two — would experience an enhanced sense of ownership of the process of governance, with only a small investment of time." - [An Introduction to Liquid Democracy, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/liquid-democracy-9cf7a4cb7f#:~:text=Even%20citizens%20who%20remained%20minimally%20politically%20engaged%20%E2%80%94%20perhaps%20just%20resetting%20their%20proxies%20in%20the%20main%20issue%20areas%20every%20year%20or%20two%20%E2%80%94%20would%20experience%20an%20enhanced%20sense%20of%20ownership%20of%20the%20process%20of%20governance%2C%20with%20only%20a%20small%20investment%20of%20time.)


> "One approach to this challenge is to have the Liquid Democracy software platform build in levels of viscosity, that is, ways of slowing down the overall process and requiring reconsideration and confirmation of decisions possibly made in haste." - [An Introduction to Liquid Democracy, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/liquid-democracy-9cf7a4cb7f#:~:text=One%20approach%20to%20this%20challenge%20is%20to%20have%20the%20Liquid%20Democracy%20software%20platform%20build%20in%20levels%20of%20viscosity%2C%20that%20is%2C%20ways%20of%20slowing%20down%20the%20overall%20process%20and%20requiring%20reconsideration%20and%20confirmation%20of%20decisions%20possibly%20made%20in%20haste.)

> "A related problem concerns protections from the “tyranny of the majority.” The Founders of this nation were right to have a Bill of Rights, and to arrange for the protection of minority opinions. In addition to viscosity playing a role in slowing things down, super majorities could be required for certain types of actions, such as those limiting civil liberties, or declarations of war." - [An Introduction to Liquid Democracy, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/liquid-democracy-9cf7a4cb7f#:~:text=A%20related%20problem,declarations%20of%20war.)

The cartoon below shows all the dogs on a life raft raising a paw to affirm their leader’s injunction to eat all of the salvaged dog food immediately. Bad decision! As books like [Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/162120.Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds) show, human beings are quite capable of developing mass delusions, so it is not too hard to envision a terrible idea gaining credence and rapidly spreading through the proxy delegation process." - [An Introduction to Liquid Democracy, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/liquid-democracy-9cf7a4cb7f#:~:text=Another%20problem%20to,proxy%20delegation%20process.)

liquid democracy is made easier when concepts and assertions have unique stable IDs that can be pointed to

the future of search is being able to re-run aggregation & statistics based on different filters

We should be able to split our delegation to multiple other entities with different weights

in cyberspace we can have something other than first-past-the-post voting - we don't need to be limited to it

every claim and counter should be verifiable - even if at a processing cost
common knowledge should go there?

ranked choice voting
https://fairvote.org/our-reforms/ranked-choice-voting/

Ranked: Sortable options as ranked preferences. Arrow's impossibility theorem must be taken into consideration for any innovation regarding ranked ballots.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_voting

ability to specify criteria for the delegation - no need to pick specific people.

current twitter polls don't allow us to show our vote but we're free to express it in text publicly?

Study shows happiness doesnt increase above 200$k salary. Fuck that - do a poll

liquid democracy can be used to inform how recommender systems work for any field - not just for political questions. Even content moderation

> "- Base-100 Vote: Voters have 100 points that they can cast for any voting issue, they can distribute those points arbitrarily in the network; this allows voters to express “partial agreement” or “partial disagreement votes” with issues and/or particular nodes, giving an unprecedented capacity of plasticity, specificity, self-organization, malleability, resiliency and robustness to the network. Example: A voter wants to automatically issue 50 of his 100 Points for Health-related issues to his doctor, 20 points to a family member that has knowledge in a related field, and keep 30 points for himself.
>
> - Negative Voting: Voters can use their points to subtract representational power from other individuals or groups who they feel are gathering too much weight in the system or that represent interests contrary to their stance. Example: A voter wants to use some of the points to mitigate the perceived excessive influence of an individual, while also issuing some of the points in favor of someone who holds a position that is considered to deserve more weight in the system.
>
> - Embedded Preference: Voters can propagate their points to their selected representatives with an embedded preference, so the representatives can know what is the personal intention of their representees, and might or might not choose to follow their recommendation. Example: A voter indicates that he is in favor of a certain level of tax, but his representative might choose to cast a vote that is different to that initial preference (The latency system will always offer the owner of the points the chance to certify the use of their voting power)
>
> - Divided Voting: Voters might want to vote for individuals or issues that are inherently in opposition to each other, maybe as a way to express their recognition for good political work on different individuals or groups holding different stances, or simply because there is an actual indecision or ambiguity, or because they want to leverage the playing field by making a certain decision more contested. This confers the system a virtually infinite capacity of self-correction and nuanced complexity. Example: A voter might want to use some of the points to support “Individual A” while also recognizing the validity of argument presented by “Individual B”
>
> - Transparent or Secret Voting: Voters might chose to cast their points in a public or private way, they can even hide their points from the recipients, to avoid them from playing into populist positions. This quality of the system also reduces strategies of preference falsification that is intrinsic to a scheme that only allows for secret voting, as no user has any evidence of what a certain voter really stands for; by having public voting as an option, individuals can confirm what are the actual positions of other nodes in the network. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Vote History: Voters have total control over the historical use and current holders of their representational power. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Boolean & Gradient Voting: The community can vote on boolean (binary) and gradient-ed (nuanced) issues, as the total amount of votes can indicate not only if a decision should be made, but also how much of that decision should be implemented. Example: Should drones fly at +30000 feet with commercial planes? (Yes/No) ? Once the community has voted for “No”, then a vote can be issued about what is the maximum flight at which drones would be allowed to fly (0 ft. to 29 999 ft.) in which case a Bell-Shaped curve of votes would probably result on drones maximum fly height to be set at ~15 000 ft." - [Competency-Based Propagative Democracy](https://ernestoeduardo.medium.com/propagative-democracy-c00e5d327194#:~:text=Base%2D100%20Vote,15%20000%20ft.)

# immune system & negative feedback
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

Yesterday, @MichelleObama announced she is partnering with a junk food company to sell sugar water to kids. We must speak plainly: this is a cynical cash grab. 
https://twitter.com/calleymeans/status/1654188254336528385

Transitive negative signals: anything relying on this even indirectly should be notified about X

we can reach a consensus what type of negative reputation we want to see

We can choose the types of negative reputation and we can vote on norms too

sunlight is the best disenfecatant

> "Advertising is legitimised lying." - [H. G. Wells](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/37198-advertising-is-legitimised-lying)


Its not advertising thats the problem - its the lack of negative reputation and the lack pf an immune system

Signaling slot machine tactics through negative reputation

we need to counteract market failures and negative externalities but currently we don't have the means to do so - we can't come to a consensus and organize

wealth leads to power over regulation which leads to making more money in the market - a positive feedback loop that doesn't have a counteracting force - such systems are unstable and self-terminate

Gm killed the electric car - that should haunt them for eternity. And no, they didn't "lead", and that matters
Mary, you electrified the entire auto industry, you led, and it matters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UduPjk9gonw

What if we can flag stores for manipulative placement of goods - such as sugary stuff close to the isles and cashiers - because thats when people are tempted the most? Why cant we influence the real world?

Without negative reputation we cant develop an immune system
Our societal immune system to bullshit is handicapped - crippled

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback

> "The adaptive immune system is a complex system involving different immune cells, signaling molecules and cytokines, however, the importance of different feedback and feedforward loops (FFLs) and the underlying crosstalks are often overlooked. In particular, negative feedback loops are very important in regulating the response that determines immunity vs. tolerance." - [Importance of Feedback and Feedforward Loops to Adaptive Immune Response Modeling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202469/#:~:text=The%20adaptive%20immune%20system,determines%20immunity%20vs.%20tolerance.)

Today's economy driven by advertising is mostly comprised of positive feedback loops but we also need to develop channels for negative feedback loops
a positive feedback loop: advertising tricks us into buying processed food which makes us sicker which takes a toll on our finances and happiness which leads to going back to food for pleasure
positive feedback loops in the economy are way stronger than negative feedback loops because of the disproportionate influence of money and advertising over us

> "Time to light the torches: create a pledge. The pledge is simple: “I pledge to not buy anything from any of the companies on the List so long as they do business with any company that is connected with Monsanto.” McDonalds, want me to buy another McWhatever? Then you need to get busy changing to a non-Monsanto supplier for your potatoes." - [Beyond torches and pitchforks: reimagining the angry mob, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/practical-imagination/beyond-torches-and-pitchforks-reimagining-the-angry-mob-67594032f49d#:~:text=Time%20to%20light,for%20your%20potatoes.)

what if instead of caring if someone liked your nonsense tweet you had cast a vote and can see if others vote the same way as you - not liking a textual comment of yours, but you influencing them to vote the same way you did

> Often frame control is much less concerned with logical persuasion or conveyance of particular facts than with controlling the interpretive framework in which the whole story can be understood. Rather than make a logical argument, particular ideas and images are selected (or excluded), these are juxtaposed in a suggestive manner, leaving an emotional or moral impression that important claims have been settled. This is often true, even though certain other important claims and evidence that were not mentioned remain unsettled.
>
> Best practices for media to avoid frame control include: **Show as much data as you can that is relevant; orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed; know when fact checking is not enough; clarify what is important and why to justify focus; share multiple frames; acknowledge what is not known and where there is no basis for certainty; argue counter narratives and share facts that seem to support an alternative hypothesis**" - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Frame%20control%20is,an%20alternative%20hypothesis)

> "**Competing unverifiable claims result in a situation of narrative deadlock in which irreconcilable views become entrenched.** There is no way out of deadlock until the competing narratives can be broken down into potentially verifiable elements, which can then become a focus of investigation by both parties. Absent an earnest assessment of the veracity of claims there is no way to resolve a dispute, and so the tactic of engagement often reverts into frame control rather than analysis and argumentation. Where the situation is such that we cannot verify or falsify key elements, then all parties should hold tentative beliefs with low enough confidence to not start “wars” over them. The ability to hold beliefs tentatively is important also for any person or group seeking to avoid confirmation bias." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Competing%20unverifiable%20claims,avoid%20confirmation%20bias.)

> "To avoid being captured by polarization there must be awareness of the negative impacts of the dynamic, as well as the means by which it takes effect. Polarization involves not doing synthesis; it means being wrong or at least problematically partial. Polarization dynamics also result in orienting towards “war” rather than coordination. The dynamics sometimes stem from actual, explicit political alliances, but almost always involve appealing to the biases and emotions of an in-group against an out-group. The speed bias forcing sloppy work, as soundbites force a narrowing of perspectives and advertising revenues demand more clicks and longer times on page, reinforces polarization." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=To%20avoid%20being,page%2C%20reinforces%20polarization.)

> "It is possible to act in ways that decrease polarization. The media should explicitly differentiate, gauge, and discuss the plausibility of claims when presenting them. As complexity and polarization increases it becomes more important to show as much data as you can that is relevant, to orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed, and to know when fact-checking is not enough. When narrowing focus, clarify what is important and essential to know, justify and explain why one story is being told rather than another.
