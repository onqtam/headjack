Capitalism as alignment 1.0 - What’s its essence?
- Collective intelligence
- Competition and evolution
- Self-interest - human nature
- Meritocracy
- Responsibility & skin in the game
> "The amount of valuable information stuck in people’s heads about people, products, and companies that would influence investment decisions, purchasing decisions, and hiring/joining decisions is massive." - [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1746738383127503255)

hoarding information & profiting from it - example:
- a hedge fund gets early good information about an upcoming pandemic
- they try to make money by betting on a downturn (and they hope it's bad) and not share the info immediately to the public and try to build a good case to help steer policy such that the downturn isn't that high
What if the brightest minds were not in hedge funds but instead predicting in public what would happen and try to minimize the problems instead of hoarding the info of what's about to happen for maximum gain? What if helping the public brought bigger or at least comparable gains? We need to redefine status.

"I think that most capitalists don’t know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists don’t know how to grow it well, yet we are now at a juncture in which either a) people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re-engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b) we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie." - [Ray Dalio](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-how-capitalism-needs-reformed-parts-1-2-ray-dalio/#:~:text=I%20think%20that,shrink%20the%20pie.)

It incentivized the development of rational cognition

> "Globally, politics polarizes around that tension: conservative vs. progressive. This is a false choice. Both are mandatory. It doesn’t matter whether we like it or not. When the world around you is changing, and that change is accelerating, the question is never whether to change or stay the same. The questions we must confront are: 1) What changes are vital? (to survival and goals), and 2) How do we implement those changes in a way that doesn’t destroy the integrity of what works? Selecting a conservative vs. a progressive candidate is a false choice that we are forced to make because of broken architectures of governments." - [The Future of Governance is not Governments, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2017/01/26/future-governance-is-not-governments#:~:text=Globally%2C%20politics%20polarizes,architectures%20of%20governments.)

A [study by Martin Gilens](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) has revealed that [the most terrifying graph on democracy is a flat line](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/14/5718080/the-most-terrifying-graph-about-democracy-is-a-straight-line)

> "Is America a plutocracy? According to a 2014 study from Princeton University professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern University's Benjamin Page that examined close to 2,000 public opinion surveys, the answer may be yes. Gilens and Page found that while the opinions of everyday Americans rarely seemed to significantly influence decisions by Congress, those of the rich and interest groups did.
>
> In an ideal world... public support for an idea would more or less correlate with the probability of it becoming law. But the study found that public opinion pretty much hovers at a consistently low level of influence, regardless of how many citizens support or hate a proposal. But while average Americans seem increasingly unable to influence how they are actually governed, economic elites — the wealthy and influential — have a much greater chance of influencing legislators." - [Princeton Study Discovers What Our Politicians Really Think About Us](https://nypan.org/about/news-and-updates/2022/3/21/princeton-study-discovers-what-our-politicians-really-think-about-us#:~:text=Is%20America%20a,the%20chart%20below.)

> - Many of those who vote don’t know much about what they’re voting for, and many others simply don’t vote because they feel disempowered, like their contribution can’t change anything.
>
> - Because people feel their voices won't be heard, they use alternative ways of communicating their opinions, such as demonstrations. These are expensive, slow, don’t convey nuanced information, and are biased towards those who care a lot about an issue and are very well organized and well funded, rather than silent majorities.
>
> - We elect those who are best at communicating, not managing.

> - As a result, politicians use emotions rather than facts.

> - The policies are not tested. They’re usually simply approved. So we can’t really know if they worked or not.

> "The [Iron Law of Oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy) states that all organizations, including those committed to democratic ideals and practices, will inevitably succumb to rule by an elite few (an oligarchy). The theory states that true democracy can't happen mechanically, because a large number of people cannot coordinate or organize. Only small groups can organize. So whenever you have “democracy” or a large number of people who are supposed to coordinate, they simply can’t. So instead a small number of people who can coordinate seize all the power." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=the%20Iron%20Law%20of%20Oligarchy%20states,can%20coordinate%20seize%20all%20the%20power.)

> "The cycle from democracy to oligarchy often looks like this:
>
> First, a large democratic group is formed. Everyone tries to have a say. This creates conflict, and all discussions go on for a long time as they try to resolve the conflict. Most people leave because the decision-making process is taking too long.
>
> Eventually, fewer people remain and some of them present their plans. The crowd picks the plans that make the most sense and the planners get designated as leadership.
>
> The planners slowly turn into the elite and start to reinforce their power. These elites also begin to control access to information and become progressively less and less accountable to the rank and file members.
>
> Over time, the oligarchy develops values that are at odds with its regular members. Elites become higher status, and feel that they must have some way of [differentiating themselves from the democratic masses](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/beliefs-are-fashions). They slowly begin to push for things that are [good for elites but not necessarily good for the rest of the group](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-hypocrisy-of-elites).
>
> Once it is in place, democratic members lack the means to displace the oligarchy. It would require coordination that democracies simply don’t have. Additionally, the oligarchy won out as the most effective structure due to its strategic capabilities. For this reason, in any formally democratic organization, power will always slowly disperse away from members and into the hands of an elite." - [DAOs and The Iron Law of Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/daos-and-the-iron-law-of-oligarchy#:~:text=The%20cycle%20from,of%20an%20elite.)

It's not just that people just care more about politics, which is kind of the conventional explanation, it’s that there are attempts to politically control companies for this specific purpose, because it's the escape hatch to be able to do things the government itself can't do.
>
> One way to think about this is to imagine if private companies were actually part of the government. To paraphrase a line of thinking others have explained far better: If Harvard were the US department of expertise, would anything really change? If the Brookings Institution was the US department of public policy analysis would anything really change? If The New York Times was the US department of information would anything really change? If Google was the US department of search would anything really change?” If the answer is “little or none”, you know what they are today." - [America the Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/america-the-oligarchy#:~:text=In%20the%20same,they%20are%20today.)

>
> The truth is that 99% of government employees are not accountable to a market nor a democratic process. Neither bought by a customer nor picked by a voter. Which is why democracy isn’t a good way of describing what’s actually happening.
>
> And how could it? The reality is that power is always wielded by a tightly organized minority group against a disorganized mess. This is because the masses cannot organize. For a few structural reasons:
>
> First, you can’t get everyone in the room at the same time. Second, they neither have the skills nor interest nor the time to educate themselves on the issues, let alone organize for power. A crowd without organized leadership will simply devolve into a rabble. Think Occupy Wall Street.
>
> In addition to technical reasons, there are psychological reasons. Most people want to be led. They don’t want to figure out every single thing for themselves. They want to outsource the hard decisions and questions to other leaders far more compelling than themselves. And for the people who want to lead, no amount of power is ever enough. People who acquire power always want to consolidate and extend it. As they say, absolute power corrupts absolutely." - [America the Oligarchy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/america-the-oligarchy#:~:text=Not%20democratic%3F%20How,power%20corrupts%20absolutely.)

>
> The boards and senior executive teams are just like this too. They will do exactly what is expected of them as members of the oligarchic elite. They have the exact same politics as their peers in that structure. And they all implement the same policies at the same time.
>
> Indeed: We have a theocratic oligarchy wearing the suit of a representative democracy. The oligarchy spans government officials and bureaucrats as well as heads of companies, universities, media properties, foundations, etc. These people care immensely about what their peers at Davos, at Aspen, in the pages of the New York Times, at Harvard, at their dinner parties think.

>
> Burnham, Schumpeter, and others observed that the closer you get to government, the more you see how the government operates in conjunction with any given industry. The field of public choice has a name for this, regulatory capture: where corporations gain so much power in the government that they “capture” their regulator and end up implementing regulations in their industry that have the effect of cementing their market positions in place and preventing new competition. We see this in pharma, housing, healthcare, education, taxi cab industry — nearly every regulated industry.

> "Appeals to authority run more of society than we realize: Who designs government policies? Experts. Who do journalists quote in newspapers? Experts. And who are these experts? Professors. Who funds these professors? The government. Who votes for the government? The public. Who educates the public? Professors and journalists. Oh. 
>
> Balaji calls this the information supply chain: Stanford does a study which gets published in a peer reviewed journal, like [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) or [Science](https://www.science.org/). That study is then written about in the New York Times and becomes conveyed as truth. Finally, the U.S. Government then enacts some policy based broadly on that original study, claiming their action is based in science. 
>
> This phenomenon is codified deeply into our culture. Take Wikipedia as another example. If you wanted to know where the information came from on a given Wikipedia page, you'd see it came from "[reliable sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources)". Who contributes to those "reliable sources"? What exactly is a reliable source? Wikipedia explains in very clear English what a reliable source is. Get ready for it. A reliable source is a source….that’s reliable.

> Is there a mechanism for determining whether the NYT is or isn't a reliable source? Not really. It’s arbitrary. The NYT is grandfathered in. The NYT could write nonsense everyday, but who keeps track? Who even cares? For most people, it all gets lost in the chaos. Sure, they lose some subscribers on the red team.

> "The core function of science is not peer review, publishing in a prestigious journal, or having an academic affiliation. It’s independent replication — the repetition of an experiment such that the variance of that experiment can be better estimated. 
>
> To say that true scientific inquiry is the same as a general appeal to authority is categorically incorrect. The latter may have the form of science, in the sense that it could be laid out like a logically sound argument, but it doesn't have the substance of science, which is based on independent replication. 
>
> And yet, we can’t replicate experiments at the drop of a hat, so we do rely on prestige as a proxy. Because it’s so hard for people to disprove claims, or for us to keep track of who’s been right and who’s been wrong over time, they’re more likely to believe  elite media and universities when they say something is true, no matter how often they’re wrong. 
>
> Despite how wrong epidemiologists are, despite how wrong nutrition science was for decades—food pyramid anyone?—despite the replication crisis which challenges much of psychology—nothing really changes. When elite media and universities say something is true, people will believe it. Furthermore, often people won’t believe a claim until it gets blessed by the experts.
>
> But just because they say something is true, and just because people believe it, doesn’t mean it’s actuallytrue. 
>
> You can see this as the difference between political and technical truths.
>
> Political truths are judged entirely by social consensus — who the president is, whether the dollar has value, or whether the New York Times or Harvard is elite.
>
> But for technology, popularity and truth are not one in the same. Technical truths are things that are true regardless of popularity — the weather, the chemistry of a compound, or the money supply of Bitcoin.

> "We used to have a control mechanism: the will of the people as expressed through political institutions. That served as a restraint on run-away financialization and other forms of exploitation by big money. The system now has no self-restraint; it’s an out-of-control machine only optimizing on short-term money-on-money return. What is the result? Systemic fragility." - [In Search of the 5th Attractor, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/fifth-attractor-6d1a54fcda2e#:~:text=We%20used%20to%20have%20a%20control,What%20is%20the%20result%3F%20Systemic%20fragility.)

And then build restraints back into the economic system. I’m not a person who speaks against the market; the market is actually a brilliant invention that creates many semi-equilibria that interoperate without much top-down decision making. It is the most effective platform found so far for real-time information sharing through the mechanism of pricing. Run correctly, it’s like a furnace that can heat our house. But the way we’re currently operating our economic system, we’ve let the fire out of the furnace, and it’s burning the house down.

> "Following the example of autoimmune diseases, the main cause of warfare is a misidentification, i.e. perceiving a fellow cell within humanity as the Other. Although the actors of war are political organizations (following Levy & Thompson’s definition of war), individuals are the ones who do the actual fighting to advance the interests of the leadership of a particular political organization. In the case of warfare, the interest of the leadership and the fighting individuals rarely correlate. Consequently, the political elite must convince the public that liquidating fellow cells within the collective body is the only option left to resolve an ongoing conflict. Here ideology plays the most crucial role. State ideology is disseminated to the people via various propaganda organs. The false framework of “us vs. them” is established by magnifying the differences between human beings (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political opinion, membership of a particular social group etc.) while willfully ignoring the fact that we are equally important and valuable cells within humanity. Divide et impera (“divide and conquer”) is an ancient Latin maxim that was widely used in every historical era. In the twentieth and twenty-first century we witnessed narratives based on binary opposites such as Aryan vs. Jew (World War II), communist vs. capitalist (Cold War) and terrorist vs. peace-loving citizen (War on Terror). Creating an image of the enemy (the Other) and instilling fear in the public are classic examples of the propaganda machine specifically designed to manufacture an ideology based on division." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "The healthy state of humanity is peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Although the increasing destructiveness of military technology reduced the incentives of major powers to fight large-scale wars, we still see significant amount of warfare in the world. These developments suggest that the general quality of consciousness of humanity is rather low. Identifying a fellow cell as an enemy because it lives in another organ (cf. nationality), looks like a red blood cell instead of a white one (cf. race), believes in the heart instead of the brain (cf. religion), and follows the kidney instead of the gall bladder (cf. political affiliation), is not the characteristic of an efficient, well-organized, low-entropy system. I suggest that the top-down approach toward peaceful coexistence does not work as the failure of the Kellogg-Briand pact (1928) demonstrated. The potentially more effective bottom-up design (eradicating ignorance one person at a time by identifying the Other as an equal unit within the collective body) may lead to a quantum leap in the consciousness of humanity that will result in – among others – the total absence of warfare based on the realization of our interconnectedness and essential oneness. The reason why the so-called Golden Rule of every major world religion stipulates to treat others the way we would like to be treated is because every individuated unit is part of the whole (i.e. humanity, and ultimately, the Self). Given that the Self (the Absolute that is commonly referred to as Tao in Taoism, Brahman in Hinduism, God in Christianity, Yahweh in Judaism and Allah in Islam) consists of everything and everybody (the four elements, the mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom and the human kingdom), harming the Other is literally harming the Self – myself. The only possible explanation behind damaging the Other is the lack of recognition that there is no Other: everything and everybody is part of the Self." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "In the classic of Liji (Book of Rites) there is the famous passage generally called datongpian (Essay on Grand Harmony) which is one of the hallmarks of Chinese civilization. The Essay depicts the utopia of the ancients which is a society governed by the most virtuous and capable people. There is no unrest, robbery, theft, machination, and people do not need to close their doors when they sleep at night." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "Immense financial, natural and human resources are directed at warfare, even though one trivial realization on a mass scale would result in the total cessation of all hostilities. This realization is that every Other (the so-called “enemy”) is in actuality a fellow cell, because regardless of the superficial differences these very units comprise the living organism we call humanity. The healthy, peaceful, cooperative state of humanity needs to be every responsible human being’s concern." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

With the continued acceleration of technology, and without serious efforts to protect humanity, there is strong reason to believe the risk will be higher this century, and increase with each century that technological progress continues.

We're a mindless & unconscious energy-hungry superorganism with an embedded growth obligation in its economy & monetary system that is unable to contract and a lack of an immune system against market failures such as negative externalities and the exploitation of human psychology.
sociopathic corporations
we've been culturally hijacked through psychological operations
also lacks an immune system - leaving market forces unchecked.
with the goal of reaching sustainability and homeostasis.
Nobody is truly in the driver's seat - the system is running on its own
The current economy is the dreaded paperclip maximizer

> "Humanity lives within two interlinked systems: the biosphere and global civilization. Together, they are the life support system for all humans. For the first time in history, the structure of our growing global civilization is undermining the integrity of the biosphere upon which it depends. We are crossing planetary boundaries of both extraction and pollution, threatening the ability of our civilizational system to continue.
>
> We are rapidly developing and distributing increasingly powerful new technologies across most domains in society. Technological progress is changing our civilization radically, bringing many benefits, while at the same time expanding the range and scope of catastrophic risks.
>
> Advanced technologies increase the potential scale and externalities of violence and warfare. No earlier civilization could rapidly destroy the world in totalizing warfare, nor debase the integrity of the entire biosphere. An increasing range of new catastrophic weaponry continues to advance and move into the hands of a wider variety of actors. New types of chemical pollution and greater tools of environmental extraction are being developed, despite the passing of critical planetary boundaries. The increasing number and probability of human-induced global catastrophic risks is unprecedented and nearing irreversibility.
>
> We have the technological ability to split the nucleus of an atom, edit the genetic base code of life, drive the rapid extinction of many species, create new genetically modified organisms, destroy whole ecosystems, and construct vast human-built environments. And now we have the ability to create artificial intelligences capable of advancing all categories of technology—as well as their strategic deployment—exponentially faster." - [Civilization Research Institute](https://civilizationresearchinstitute.org/#:~:text=Humanity%20lives%20within,deployment%E2%80%94exponentially%20faster.)

> "So if we drop the baton, succumbing to an existential catastrophe, we would fail our ancestors in a multitude of ways. We would fail to achieve the dreams they hoped for; we would betray the trust they placed in us, their heirs; and we would fail in any duty we had to pay forward the work they did for us. To neglect existential risk might thus be to wrong not only the people of the future, but the people of the past." - [Toby Ord](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10253276-so-if-we-drop-the-baton-succumbing-to-an-existential)

> "If we learned that a large asteroid was heading toward Earth, posing a greater than 10 percent chance of human extinction later this century, there would be little debate about whether to make serious efforts to build a deflection system, or to ignore the issue and run the risk. To the contrary, responding to the threat would immediately become one of the world’s top priorities. Thus our lack of concern about these threats is much more to do with not yet believing that there are such threats, than it is about seriously doubting the immensity of the stakes." - [Toby Ord](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10254781-if-we-learned-that-a-large-asteroid-was-heading-toward)

> "Civilizations die from suicide, not by murder." - [Arnold J. Toynbee](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/25960-civilizations-die-from-suicide-not-by-murder)

> "Consider the challenge of continued progress. Scientific advancement is slowing. Low-hanging fruit are being plucked, as new ideas—and disruptive ideas—are getting harder to find. Economic growth is slowing. Innovative patents are declining. Birth rates are falling. Populations are aging. Debt is rising. Culture is drifting. Political progress—i.e. toward liberal democracy—is reversing. The climate is changing. The international order is breaking. Space colonies may be harder than we thought, and less politically appealing than we thought. New technologies may be less revolutionary and more overregulated than we thought (especially if we ban or “pause” AI, as many EAs want to do). Our ability to outcompete our elders—possibly the main thing holding our society together—is slipping away.
>
> Social scientists have long known that all good things about a society go together—health, wealth, trust, democracy, trade, peace, innovation—making it difficult to tease apart what causes what. It’s likely that everything causes everything—a virtuous cycle of good things causing good things. But the flipside is that bad things go together too. It’s a rat’s nest of multi-causality and positive feedback loops, which means that any downward trajectory may be self-reinforcing. One small misstep could send us sliding down a long and slippery slope.

> Sure, we may have lucked out for a couple centuries by stumbling into the right incentive structures, namely science, markets, and democracy. But those incentive structures are fragile. Science rewards truth-seeking, markets reward cooperation, and democracy rewards accountability (barely). But when science stops advancing, markets stop innovating, and demagoguery eats democracy, the machinery of progress will grind to a halt—or reverse.
