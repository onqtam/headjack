> "Tomasello et al tested human toddlers vs. apes on a series of traditional IQ type questions. The match-up was surprisingly fair; in areas like memory, logic, and spatial reasoning, the three species did about the same. But in ability to learn from another person, humans wiped the floor with the other two ape species." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Tomasello%20et%20al,two%20ape%20species%3A)

> "Transmitting culture to the next generation is maybe the core human skill. The human brain is optimized to make this work as well as possible." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=transmitting%20culture%20to%20the%20next%20generation%20is%20maybe%20the%20core%20human%20skill.%20The%20human%20brain%20is%20optimized%20to%20make%20this%20work%20as%20well%20as%20possible.)

> "In the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis, humans live in obligate symbiosis with a culture. A brain without an associated culture is incomplete and not very useful. So the infant brain is adapted to seek out the important aspects of its local culture almost from birth and fill them into the appropriate slots in order to become whole." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=In%20the%20Cultural,to%20become%20whole.)

> "Learn from people who are good at things and/or widely-respected... People will fear and obey authority figures like kings and chieftains, but they give a different kind of respect (“prestige”) to people who seem good at things. And since it’s hard to figure out who’s good at things (can a non-musician who wants to start learning music tell the difference between a merely good performer and one of the world’s best?) most people use the heuristic of respecting the people who other people respect. Once you identify someone as respect-worthy, you strongly consider copying them in, well, everything." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20people,in%2C%20well%2C%20everything)

> "A naïve learner can’t tell all the causal links between an individual’s practices and his success. As a consequence, learners often copy their chosen models broadly across many domains. Of course, learners may place more weight on domains that for one reason or other seem more causally relevant to the model’s success. This copying often includes the model’s personal habits or styles as well as their goals and motivations, since these may be linked to their success. This “if in doubt, copy it” heuristic is one of the reasons why success in one domain converts to influence across a broad range of domains.

> The immense range of celebrity endorsements in modern societies shows the power of prestige. For example, NBA star Lebron James, who went directly from High School to the pros, gets paid millions to endorse State Farm Insurance. Though a stunning basketball talent, it’s unclear why Mr. James is qualified to recommend insurance companies. Similarly, Michael Jordan famously wore Hanes underwear and apparently Tiger Woods drove Buicks. Beyonce’ drinks Pepsi (at least in commercials). What’s the connection between musical talent and sugary cola beverages?

> Finally, while new medical findings and public educational campaigns only gradually influence women’s approach to preventive medicine, Angelina Jolie’s single OP-ED in the New York Times, describing her decision to get a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had the ‘faulty’ BRCA1 gene, flooded clinics from the U.K. to New Zealand with women seeking genetic screenings for breast cancer. Thus, an unwanted evolutionary side effect, prestige turns out to be worth millions, and represents a powerful and underutilized public health tool." - [The Secret of Our Success](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=A%20na%C3%AFve%20learner,public%20health%20tool.)

> "Here is an outline of what I mean by cultural evolution:
>
> - Human culture includes language, artifacts, music, stories, rituals, behaviors, and other information stored inside and outside of human brains.
>
> - Humans acquire culture through social learning. There are two major pathways of transmission: vertical, from parents to children only, or horizontal, between unrelated people. The mode of transmission is itself a major selective factor, shaping the content of culture.
>
> - Culture cannot survive and reproduce itself without humans; humans, after long dependence on culture, can no longer survive and reproduce themselves without it.
>
> - Cultures vary and change, and experience differential “reproductive” success: they spread or fail to spread, and their host populations grow or shrink.
>
> - Biological organisms only change by selection on random mutations. Culture, on the other hand, varies in part through intentional (non-random) human action. Despite this, it is rarely the case that humans fully understand all the functions of their culture, or predict how any changes they make will affect them and their descendants. (See, e.g., Alex Mesoudi, Foresight in cultural evolution.)

> - The relationship between humans and their culture is best modeled as a relationship between host and symbiote or between host and parasite, depending on the fitness cost extracted by culture, with humans as the host." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=here%20is%20an,as%20the%20host.)

> "Culture is not a luxury; it is life or death. Culture has likely been the most important part of the human selective environment for hundreds of thousands of years. Humans are not adapted to life without culture...
>
> Humans rely on culture to survive not only in marginal environments, but even in environments rich with resources, such as the Australian outback. People rely on culture to obtain sources of food, and also to eat their food safely" - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/)

> "The evolution of religion is one of the most interesting and ignored areas of cultural evolution. We tend to exaggerate the degree of rationality and conscious thought in human life, ignoring the enormous and influential contribution of magical thinking. Just as there are vital amines (vitamins) that human cultures must figure out how to supply us with, there are social and cognitive equivalents; modernity may do as poor a job supplying us with social belonging and ritual as it does supplying us with proper nutrition." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=The%20evolution%20of%20religion,us%20with%20proper%20nutrition.)

> "While unselfconscious evolution with limited foresight can no longer be relied upon to produce solutions of good fit, an understanding of evolutionary processes is essential to producing such fit. In particular, the constraints that have not changed for humans – nutritional, social, and cognitive – must be recognized, and old, hard-won solutions to these constraints must be seriously considered as essential building blocks of  synthetic, selfconsciously-designed solutions to human flourishing." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=While%20unselfconscious%20evolution,to%20human%20flourishing.)
