> "The idea is that human culture as broadly defined-art, politics, technology, religion, and so on-evolves in much the way biological species evolve: new cultural traits arise and may flourish or perish, and as a result whole institutions and belief systems form and change." - [Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/767364-the-idea-is-that-human-culture-as-broadly-defined-art-politics)

> "Tomasello et al tested human toddlers vs. apes on a series of traditional IQ type questions. The match-up was surprisingly fair; in areas like memory, logic, and spatial reasoning, the three species did about the same. But in ability to learn from another person, humans wiped the floor with the other two ape species." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Tomasello%20et%20al,two%20ape%20species%3A)

> "In the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis, humans live in obligate symbiosis with a culture. A brain without an associated culture is incomplete and not very useful. So the infant brain is adapted to seek out the important aspects of its local culture almost from birth and fill them into the appropriate slots in order to become whole." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=In%20the%20Cultural,to%20become%20whole.)

> "Learn from people who are good at things and/or widely-respected... People will fear and obey authority figures like kings and chieftains, but they give a different kind of respect (“prestige”) to people who seem good at things. And since it’s hard to figure out who’s good at things (can a non-musician who wants to start learning music tell the difference between a merely good performer and one of the world’s best?) most people use the heuristic of respecting the people who other people respect. Once you identify someone as respect-worthy, you strongly consider copying them in, well, everything." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20people,in%2C%20well%2C%20everything)

> "A naïve learner can’t tell all the causal links between an individual’s practices and his success. As a consequence, learners often copy their chosen models broadly across many domains. Of course, learners may place more weight on domains that for one reason or other seem more causally relevant to the model’s success. This copying often includes the model’s personal habits or styles as well as their goals and motivations, since these may be linked to their success. This “if in doubt, copy it” heuristic is one of the reasons why success in one domain converts to influence across a broad range of domains.

> The immense range of celebrity endorsements in modern societies shows the power of prestige. For example, NBA star Lebron James, who went directly from High School to the pros, gets paid millions to endorse State Farm Insurance. Though a stunning basketball talent, it’s unclear why Mr. James is qualified to recommend insurance companies. Similarly, Michael Jordan famously wore Hanes underwear and apparently Tiger Woods drove Buicks. Beyonce’ drinks Pepsi (at least in commercials). What’s the connection between musical talent and sugary cola beverages?

> Finally, while new medical findings and public educational campaigns only gradually influence women’s approach to preventive medicine, Angelina Jolie’s single OP-ED in the New York Times, describing her decision to get a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had the ‘faulty’ BRCA1 gene, flooded clinics from the U.K. to New Zealand with women seeking genetic screenings for breast cancer. Thus, an unwanted evolutionary side effect, prestige turns out to be worth millions, and represents a powerful and underutilized public health tool." - [The Secret of Our Success](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=A%20na%C3%AFve%20learner,public%20health%20tool.)

> "Here is an outline of what I mean by cultural evolution:
>
> - Human culture includes language, artifacts, music, stories, rituals, behaviors, and other information stored inside and outside of human brains.
>
> - Humans acquire culture through social learning. There are two major pathways of transmission: vertical, from parents to children only, or horizontal, between unrelated people. The mode of transmission is itself a major selective factor, shaping the content of culture.
>
> - Culture cannot survive and reproduce itself without humans; humans, after long dependence on culture, can no longer survive and reproduce themselves without it.
>
> - Cultures vary and change, and experience differential “reproductive” success: they spread or fail to spread, and their host populations grow or shrink.
>
> - Biological organisms only change by selection on random mutations. Culture, on the other hand, varies in part through intentional (non-random) human action. Despite this, it is rarely the case that humans fully understand all the functions of their culture, or predict how any changes they make will affect them and their descendants. (See, e.g., Alex Mesoudi, Foresight in cultural evolution.)

> "Culture is not a luxury; it is life or death. Culture has likely been the most important part of the human selective environment for hundreds of thousands of years. Humans are not adapted to life without culture...

> Humans rely on culture to survive not only in marginal environments, but even in environments rich with resources, such as the Australian outback. People rely on culture to obtain sources of food, and also to eat their food safely" - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/)

> "The evolution of religion is one of the most interesting and ignored areas of cultural evolution. We tend to exaggerate the degree of rationality and conscious thought in human life, ignoring the enormous and influential contribution of magical thinking. Just as there are vital amines (vitamins) that human cultures must figure out how to supply us with, there are social and cognitive equivalents; modernity may do as poor a job supplying us with social belonging and ritual as it does supplying us with proper nutrition." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=The%20evolution%20of%20religion,us%20with%20proper%20nutrition.)

> "While unselfconscious evolution with limited foresight can no longer be relied upon to produce solutions of good fit, an understanding of evolutionary processes is essential to producing such fit. In particular, the constraints that have not changed for humans – nutritional, social, and cognitive – must be recognized, and old, hard-won solutions to these constraints must be seriously considered as essential building blocks of  synthetic, selfconsciously-designed solutions to human flourishing." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=While%20unselfconscious%20evolution,to%20human%20flourishing.)







> "Innovations are instead an emergent property of our species’ cultural learning abilities, applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality, (ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Brains evolved for, and entirely dependent on, the acquisition of culture — cultural brains. Our cultural brains evolved in tandem with our collective brains, and are rather limited in isolation. Indeed, there are numerous examples of the failure of big-brained explorers to survive in new environments without access to cumulative bodies of cultural know-how." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Social learners can acquire more adaptive knowledge at a lower cost, and without having to generate the information, do so with a smaller brain. Larger groups of social learners with more adaptive knowledge create a selection pressure for an extended juvenile period to acquire this knowledge. Under some circumstances, this can lead to oblique learning and selective biases to distinguish who to learn from—the human pathway to truly cultural brains." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Human brains have evolved with an ability and proclivity for selective, high fidelity social learning. In a world of imperfect cues for the adaptive value of culture, there are a variety of strategies and biases that have evolved to hone in on the most adaptive knowledge. These strategies and biases include direct and indirect cues of the popularity of cultural traits (e.g. conformist transmission bias), direct and indirect cues that a potential model has adaptive know-how worth learning (e.g. success and prestige biases), filtering mechanisms to assess the accuracy of information and sincerity of models (e.g. credibility enhancing displays), personal relevance of culture and biases toward certain content (e.g. dangerous animals, the edibility of plants, fire and gossip)." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Like the neural networks of the biological brain, the social networks of the collective brain have underlying structures. Collective brains differ in many ways: size, interconnectivity, network properties, social groupings and so on. As cross-cultural research reveals, collective brains also differ in the psychology of their constituent cultural brains. For example, some societies have a higher level of xenophobia with potential implications for the inflow of ideas from outgroups. Societies also differ in ‘tightness’ and ‘looseness’—their openness to divergent ideas—with consequent effects for cultural variance." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Not only is human culture beyond individual invention, but it also does not require its beneficiaries to understand why something works." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "At an individual level, a collective brain perspective suggests that individual innovation benefits from exposure to a wide array of ideas, beliefs, values, mental models and so on. This is part of what creates a ‘prepared mind’. Einstein, for example, was exposed to many ideas working at a patent office. Much of his work related to evaluating patents on electrical devices, including those related to the synchronization of time, which made later appearances in his thought experiments. Einstein cultivated a wide network, regularly travelling and forming friendships with the leading scientists of his day. At the level of the collective brain, there are many factors that affect the overall rate of innovation and diffusion." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

^^ we need to make as much knowledge common - private knowledge is a symptom of misalignment and slows everyone down

> "Economists typically assume material incentives drive innovators and thus innovations. However, from our point of view, recombination and incremental improvements are critical to innovation and patents can also stifle these processes by inhibiting the flow of information across individual minds, instead incentivizing secrecy. Consistent with this, historical analyses of patent laws by Moser and recent analyses of human gene patents by Williams both suggest that patent laws may often be too strong, reducing innovation, but this does not mean no patents would lead to more innovation. Based on data on pharmaceutical patents in 92 countries from 1978 to 1992, Qian argues that there may be an optimal level of protection, after which innovation is stifled. Increasing innovation is about empowering the collective brain." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Reducing the costs of failure by creating a safety net can influence innovation via multiple channels, including by allowing individuals to invest in broader social ties (expanding the collective brain) over kin ties and by increasing entrepreneurship directly. This relationship is supported by analyses of England’s old poor law, more forgiving bankruptcy laws across 15 countries, unemployment insurance in France and in the USA, the introduction of food stamps, health insurance for children and access to health insurance unbundled from employment, all of which increased entrepreneurship. Of course, there is an optimal amount of social insurance vis-à-vis innovation, because increased funding of such programmes can increase tax burdens—some data suggest that higher corporate taxes can lead to lower entrepreneurship. Overall, social safety nets energize innovation because they permit individuals to interconnect in broader, richer, networks." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although we have discussed sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance separately, they are interrelated. For example, sociality may have little effect if a task is too simple and therefore, transmission fidelity is very high or individual learning dominates solutions. Similarly, theoretical and experimental research with social network structures suggests that too much interconnectivity can decrease variance. The trade-off is between interconnectivity increasing the probability of useful recombinations in the incredibly high dimensional space of cultural combinations and the reductions in variance caused by our selective biases applying to large portions of the population. These results and the collective brain perspective suggest an optimal amount of interconnectivity. However, because real societal networks are far less dense than laboratory networks and we are far from a completely connected network, human society will probably continue to benefit from increases in interconnectivity (i.e. we are still on the positive slope). Moreover, variance is introduced by other factors, such as mistakes in transmission and individual differences in social learning and conformist biases (e.g. higher IQ individuals may be less conformist). Finally, the same principles that lead to larger populations possessing more complex technologies can also shape and hone the mechanisms of cultural transmission, such as pedagogy and language." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Changes in languages can dramatically improve the efficiency of collective brains, just as myelination can make neural pathways more efficient over ontogeny. There are many ways that cultural evolution can optimize or make languages more useful. These include larger vocabularies, bigger phonemic inventories, more grammatical tools and more learnable syntactic morphologies.. In the laboratory... artificial language transmission experiments reveal that over generations, these languages structurally change to become more learnable." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "In addition to language, cultural evolution may also be tuning the structures of the collective brain and the factors that affect sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance. This tuning may offset a problem Mesoudi discusses, whereby as cultural complexity increases, it is more difficult for each generation to acquire the growing and more complex body of adaptive knowledge. Consistent with this tuning, large-scale societies, with more complex technologies, engage in more teaching than small-scale societies, thereby increasing transmission fidelity as cultural complexity increases. There is also some evidence for increases in division of labour (increased specialization), with more international trade and more domestic outsourcing of tasks (i.e. less vertical integration of all aspects of a business). Despite these increases in pedagogy and specialization, our ‘extended juvenile period’ has become further extended with delayed age of first child and longer formal education. Finally, Americans continue to expand their vocabularies across their adult lives, which has expanded the difference in the verbal IQs between adolescents and their parents relative to prior generations, where vocabularies expanded little after the mid-twenties." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance all vary across populations and are subject to cultural evolution along a variety of dimensions. Over time, higher intergroup competition may favour institutions, such as social safety nets, that generate innovations. These factors affect the many ways in which innovations arise, such as exposure to more ideas (via cultural models prior to mass communication technologies), mistakes in transmission and serendipity through fiddling around. If these processes are the primary mechanisms through which innovations arise, then it would help explain the prevalence of Newton –Liebniz and Darwin–Wallace-type controversies. Yet, in a population of millions, it was only Newton and Liebniz who discovered calculus, only Darwin and Wallace who developed the theory of evolution by natural selection; only a handful of people who actually invented each technology. Does the collective brain really relegate the specific innovator to a fungible node at a nexus in the social network? Do cognitive abilities, like IQ or executive function, really play no part?" - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Collective brains make their constituent cultural brains more cognitively skilled in surviving in the local environment and better able to solve novel problems, using a larger repertoire of accumulated abilities. Intelligence is often assumed to underlie both individual and population differences in creativity and innovation. While, in principle, intelligence may increase transmission fidelity, intelligence (as measured by IQ) is only weakly correlated with innovativeness (as measured by creativity), r = 0.20, and is at best a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. Based on the arguments outlined in §3a, we should expect that the collective brain can make cultural brains smarter through a combination of exposure to more ideas (sociality), better learning (transmission fidelity) and willingness to deviate (transmission variance). Of these three factors, exposure to more ideas is a necessary condition, because higher fidelity by itself would be associated only with incremental improvements and increased transmission variance by itself would be associated with more ideas, most of which would be bad." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "For a species so dependent on accumulated knowledge, not only is the idea of a ‘culture-free’ IQ test meaningless, but also the idea of ‘culture-free’ IQ. Our smarts are substantially culturally acquired in ways that alter both our brains and biology, and cannot meaningfully be measured or understood independent of culture." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although some have argued for a causal relationship between IQ and development, the theory and evidence we have laid out so far suggest the opposite causal direction. Sociality (the size and interconnectedness of a population) leads to increased cultural complexity. Increased cultural complexity in turn smartens cultural brains by giving them access to a wider array of information, including physical, cognitive and linguistic tools, which may be recombined in new ways, generating new innovations. All of this is not to say that individual cognitive differences are unimportant to invention and innovation, only that these differences, like innovation, are an emergent property of the collective brain and that the focus on IQ, genius and other individual differences, as the source of innovation have missed the broader collective brain processes that explain within-group and between-group differences." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Educational psychology shows how learning some skills improve the acquisition of others. Exposure to Socratic questioning improves critical thinking more generally; learning the method of loci (attaching items to a physical location in memory) improves performance on memory tests; and exposure to the history of Darwin’s thought processes lead to a greater understanding of evolution. These may seem obvious, but demonstrate how exposure to new techniques and ideas can affect the acquisition of other techniques and ideas." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "The invention of these technologies also allows us to better understand the principles that underlie them—understanding the thermodynamics of a steam engine is a lot easier when you actually have a steam engine! We use our technologies as metaphors, analogies and concepts and they allow us to understand and innovate in ways we could not without such culture. The way in which ideas have shaped each other is a neglected aspect of cultural evolution, because it can be difficult to study." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████


> "Shared intentionality, sometimes called ‘we’ intentionality, refers to collaborative interactions in which participants share psychological states with one another. For example, in problem-solving activities participants may have a shared goal and shared action plans for pursuing that goal, and in communication they may simply share experience with one another linguistically. The big Vygotskian idea is that what makes human cognition different is not more individual brainpower, but rather the ability of humans to learn through other persons and their artifacts, and to collaborate with others in collective activities." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

> "Joint attention is not just two people experiencing the same thing at the same time, but rather it is two people experiencing the same thing at the same time and knowing together that they are doing this. This is truly intersubjective sharing, and it is critical because it creates a shared space of common psychological ground that enables everything from collaborative activities with shared goals to human-style cooperative communication." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

> "Human infants gesture in order to communicate with others in species-unique ways, for example, by pointing.

> "Whereas chimpanzees’ participation in group activities is more individualistic, 1-year-old children’s participation in group activities relies on shared intentionality in the form of shared goals and plans (perhaps underlain by skills of joint attention and cooperative communication), as well as purely social motives to share experience with others." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

> "Apes are mostly concerned with their own individual goals. They use or exploit others – by gathering information from them, manipulating them as social tools, coordinating actions with them for their own benefit – and often compete with them as well. Human children, on the other hand, often are concerned with sharing psychological states with others by providing them with helpful information, forming shared intentions and attention with them, and learning from demonstrations produced for their benefit. The emergence of these skills and motives for shared intentionality during human evolution did not create totally new cognitive skills. Rather, what it did was to take existing skills of, for example, gaze following, manipulative communication, group action, and social learning, and transform them into their collectively based counterparts of joint attention, cooperative communication, collaborative action, and instructed learning – cornerstones of cultural living. Shared intentionality is a small psychological difference that made a huge difference in human evolution in the way that humans conduct their lives." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

> "In many cases, this is due to simple execution failures. But in other cases, the institutions behave as though they were designed to achieve other, unacknowledged goals. Take school, for instance. We say that the function of school is to teach valuable skills and knowledge. Yet students don’t remember most of what they’re taught, and most of what they do remember isn’t very useful. Furthermore, our best research says that schools are structured in ways that actively interfere with the learning process, such as early wake-up times and frequent testing." - [The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11366423-in-many-cases-this-is-due-to-simple-execution-failures)

> "For example, the fact that school is boring, arduous, and full of busywork might hinder students’ ability to learn. But to the extent that school is primarily about credentialing, its goal is to separate the wheat (good future worker bees) from the chaff (slackers, daydreamers, etc.). And if school were easy or fun, it wouldn’t serve this function very well. If there were a way to fast-forward all the learning (and retention) that actually takes place in school—for example, by giving students a magic pill that taught them everything in an instant—we would still need to subject them to boring lectures and nitpicky tests in order to credential them." - [The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9440744-for-example-the-fact-that-school-is-boring-arduous-and)

According to John Stewart we need an escalator to meta-systemic cognition - to have a path for anyone to raise their awareness and understanding of our place in the developmental process and the forces within it
A cultural enlightenment

We are all complicit in ignorance
we need to upgrade our capacity to learn
We are failing at raising humans

Humans are LLMs - you poke poke and stuff comes out, and they go through very suboptimal life-long training

Learning should be a joy - an honor

What if our games taught skills that the GB needs?

We must consciously raise the awareness and education of the so-called masses

TODO: quote from here (from a teacher in NY) about how broken public schooling is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw
Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast
from minute 9:44 till 13:05

Its all about education - it never stops - not just 24 years - for life. For anything. At any time.

What if school work was not something that ends up thrown away but was aimed at contributing to society? What if all their work was meaningful and not thrown away once graded? They feel like their work is pointless & ineffectual. They're forced into non-seriousness. We're creating a kind of immaturity. (All thoughts from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast)

Harvard is a perverse concept

One upside of having kids learn & compete on serious real world issues in public building a track record is that by the time they're 25-30 they'll have more to show and prove than most 40-50 year olds and could make a serious claim to legitimacy in governance - a way to fix our gerintocracy.

The root of the metacrisis is an education crisis (Zak Stein)
also a legitimation & teacherly authority crisis - its not just a technological problem
Education is the autopoietic root of society - the way it propagates/maintains/reproduces itself

> "The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools. The right answer depends on two things, and two things alone: the existence of shared narratives and the capacity of such narratives to provide an inspired reason for schooling." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1364209-public-education-does-not-serve-a-public-it-creates-a#:~:text=The%20question%20is,reason%20for%20schooling.)

> "Learning in the Confucian sense differs markedly from “education” as our own schools practice it. It was values-laden and driven by practice, valuing life experience and role models over book learning. The very first line of the Analects places this ethos front and center: “To learn and then apply what you have learned, is this not a pleasure?” (Analects 1:1). Advanced students were exhorted: “The official, having discharged his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to becoming an official.” (Analects 13:19).
>
> Learning is not the mere acquisition of book knowledge but a continuous cycle of study, practice, reflection, and discussion. Confucian learning is something that is done in the community, with both mentors to learn from and peers to spar with. The Analects themselves are a record of this process, with Confucius instructing and sparring with his disciples and watching as his proteges go on to achieve government positions and take on disciples of their own." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)

^^ maybe take only the (Analects 13:19) part

> "Confucius did not want his students to view themselves as mere technicians or social climbers, but instead cultivate a holistic view about the social contribution of their work. He once said that “the gentleman is not a tool.” (Analects 2:12). Originally intended to warn against overspecialization, against thinking of oneself as a machine churning out deals or billable hours, this remark also rhymes with the modern slang of “tool” as a soulless social climber.
>
> This holistic view included critically thinking about the educational and professional hierarchy itself. Confucius once cuttingly remarked “In a well-governed state, it’s shameful to be poor and unknown; in a poorly governed state, it’s shameful to be rich and in office.” (Analects 8:13). Success in the hierarchy may be a means to the end of building a better society, but it is never an end in itself. There are prestigious institutions and lucrative careers that are damaging to society, such that a noble man would decline them, and moral stands for which statesmen should be ready to risk their careers. In the Confucian school, students were to carefully judge the values an institutional hierarchy promotes before entering it. In modern meritocracy, by contrast, the hierarchy only judges you.
>
> The Confucian orientation forms a telling contrast with modern striving parents, who have a sophisticated understanding of how to get into a good school but cannot articulate why. How many parents who drive their kids to achieve for the sake of getting into a good school can articulate, concretely, what a good school is supposed to do? How many can explain how a management consultant or investment banker—careers that account for over 40 percent of Harvard graduates—ought to serve civilization?
>
> This is not only an abstract societal concern. Parents who do not critically examine the institutions they drive their kids to enter are setting up their children for problems. A 2020 report from a task force in the Harvard University provost’s office reported that 31 percent of students reported suffering from depression, and 30 percent from anxiety disorders. A survey from Nature Biotechnology revealed that 53 percent of PhD students have sought mental health treatment for one of these two conditions. These educational institutions have also presided over a milieu in which marriage and childbearing are increasingly delayed and rare. The prime tenet of the tiger parent is their belief that admission to an elite university is the ticket to a good life. But this belief is disprovable by publicly available data. Their sacrifice towards this end is not only costly in terms of their family’s financial resources, but empirically does not even deliver the goods they sought.
>
> Despite the publicly available statistics, parents repeatedly find themselves surprised when their own children run into these problems. If what they seek is a good future for their children, should they not spend at least a fraction of the striving that goes into test prep and extracurriculars to ensure that their children are mentally well and have the opportunity to start a family? There is a special irony that such parents, allegedly under the influence of a Confucian tradition that venerates the family, end up funneling their kids into careerism and barrenness." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)

> "The Confucian approach offers a different perspective: we should engage with the institutions, but we should not, like tiger parents, allow their perspectives to dictate our values. We must be a judge of institutions rather than being judged by them, and we must imprint our own values on our education." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)


> "Most of the discussion of education never actually gets to this question, which put more frankly is just what is a good life? What is valuable? What's actually valuable? What are the lessons that we should teach young people about how to be a good person, about the right ways to act in the world? It's very, very simple questions, which should be at the core of education, which are actually not answered well by secular public schools, which is worth noting because they're specifically designed not to answer questions about the meaning of life. They have the civic religion, which functioned pretty well in the United States. You have the American, civic religion, where yes, you're in the school to be a good citizen, and then you have a kind of 21st century skills view, which is that you're being trained to be a participant in some kind of global workforce, like an accepting, multicultural global workforce because that's an admirable thing. The fact of the matter is that we're running a civilization on a culture that doesn't have clear answers about really fundamental questions about value, which is to say the content of education, the thing we're teaching. We've been running off of fumes of pre-modernity because the answer to what is a good life, it's actually, this is a religious question. What's a life that has not been misspent? Is there a non-arbitrary answer to that, which means an answer that's better than another answer. Not everyone's answers to that is equally valid, which is the default assumption we have now as a culture. Actually, no, there is a better or worse answer to the question of what is a life that has not been spent? What is a good life, which means what should we teach our children to become like, and what should we allow them to grow into or shape them away from? These are the questions that educators have to ask, which are deep, normative ethical questions about value. The collapse of value at the center of culture, meaning the inability to use what Charles Taylor called languages of strong evaluation, makes it so that yes, slowly the effectiveness of the educational system starts to really wane. That's the educational renaissance I'm talking about now is actually a return to a different way of speaking about value at the center of culture, which would be non-relativistic, which would have to boot from a different kind of metaphysics than a metaphysics that suggests to us that the universe itself is without meaning and that the emergence of the human is completely by chance. Just worth saying, there's never been a civilization that has run on the idea that it itself is meaningless, that the value it creates is up to us and doesn't matter to the universe. Hard to invest in a civilization that claims itself to be arbitrary, which is where our civilization has gone to. I'm talking about Yuval Harari, and people who are at the center of culture who are espousing a subtle kind of values relativism, which ends up being insidiously seeping into the educational system, makes it impossible for us to speak in normative ways about the shapes of the personalities and dispositions of the youth, which it is our responsibility to be in a position of authority. Again, it's the responsibility, the honor of the adult to be able to set boundaries. We're confused even about the legitimacy of asymmetric power, period, which is again based on the confusion about value. The work with Gaffney Wilbur, this new book is about this question, what's the core of the issue? It's actually value. Why stop the metacrisis if in fact the universe could give a shit? It's a simple way to say it and it's a little bit provocative, but when you deal with young kids, they ask very simple questions, very simple questions about why adults do the things the way they do." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=1801)

^^ from 30:01 till 34:32

> "To the extent that we want adults to collaborate and work together and resolve problems in ways that are cooperative and not hypercompetitive. We should have schooling environments that are getting kids cooperating about the most fundamental problems that they're working on. But the most fundamental problems that they're working on is their own advancement through the system, even if there's not testing. The other thing is you could take away the test because a huge anti-testing movement, which goes too far in the other direction. Even if you take away the test, we're still in a situation where we're not having honest conversations with kids about their future and very radically funneling different types of opportunities through these competitive bottlenecks. If you're not in a testing environment, then you have to do all these internships and after-school programs and other things, and think three years ahead about the college admissions thing and look at your friends suspiciously and what they're doing with their after-school activities. All of that comes in, even if you're not test-driven, there's still the competitiveness. It's funny because we almost can't imagine an educational system that would be built in a fundamentally different way, which would be one that distributed access to educational resources differently because the issue is that it's how do we actually distribute the educational resources in a way that facilitates this process of intergenerational transmission so that the civilization can not self-terminate." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3120)

> "Legitimate teacherly authority is a very real anthropological phenomenon. Now, my guess is that it goes way back. It's one of the things that distinguishes us from great apes is that we have long duration educational experience that involves this type of legitimate teacherly authority, which is that we both know there's an asymmetry of skill. We both know you're more skilled, and I, the person with less skill really want to learn, and you totally want to teach me. It's a situation of where you have authority over me that I grant you and I give you legitimate authority to help me shape my mind because we both recognize that you have this greater capacity, and I really want to learn this thing. That's legitimate teacherly authority. That can occur anywhere, anytime without any kind of institutionalized context. You hang out with farmers and stuff, so if they have some practice that you've never seen before and you want to learn from them how they get that particular type of crop grown in that way, or manage those cows to not do that thing, even though the cows could totally do that thing, how'd you get them to behave? You would drop into that relationship and you would never thematize it necessarily with them. You wouldn't be like hey, man, now I'm the student and you're the teacher, but there'd be this assumed backdrop of, okay, legitimate teacherly authority. That's a known thing, and it's very powerful and it's very important to be able to recognize that that exists because most of what we encounter with teacherly authority is in bureaucratized contexts where you have teacherly authority over me because of your position in this bureaucracy that I'm a part of, AKA a school. That means there is not necessarily a strong correlation either between my wanting really to give you specifically my authority over me, and B, you actually having an asymmetry of capacity, meaning are you really, really smart at this or are you just teaching some curriculum and I kind of know it, and if I could have my choice, I wouldn't be learning this at all. I'd be learning something else. Illegitimate teacherly authority, bureaucratically sanctioned. Illegitimate teacherly authority is the worst thing because that's a situation where you have bureaucratic authority over my mind, but you don't have greater capacity and you don't have my best interest in mind. That bleeds into propaganda basically as another class of asymmetric relationship, which is basically, so the other thing about the teacherly authority is that he wants you to learn, and in the ideal world, you graduate and you don't need the teacherly authority relationship anymore. So that's key to legitimate teacherly authority is that it's temporary. Legitimate teacherly authority is predicated on the idea that you learn as much as me and surpass me, whereas illegitimate teacherly authority or propaganda is predicated upon "No kid, you'll never actually learn the secret codes or actually learn how we thought about this little bit of dogma, which is kept behind the closed doors." Or just they're training your mind but not with your best interests, whereas a legitimate teacher, there's this cooperative relationship with the student to clarify the value being pursued." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3335)

^^ from 55:35 till 58:50

> "If you think about a civilization, and it needs at least two things to run. It needs the biophysical substrate and it needs the human substrate, if I can speak in crude terms. The core of the human substrate, reproduction, is the mother in the family, which means that the time in utero, the first months, the first years, the solidity of those environments do more than almost anything else. And so you can judge a civilization's likelihood of success in the long run in terms of where it sees value and does it see value there? Does it say actually the core of this whole thing exists right in that little relationship between the mothering one and the child and whatever that nest of caregivers that surrounds the child is that allows it to be brought into the world in a way that is humane and fully attentive. So the very base of the stack you have that need for a very healthy fundamental kind of nest. And then as you get older, you end up, yeah, the parent is the main modeler of legitimate teacherly authority. So the parent's main responsibility in my philosophy of education, bear with me, would be that, would be to be the first way you model legitimate teacherly authority. And the main concern I have now is the confusion of teacherly authority, both through the bureaucratization and through the mediatization, meaning social media, meaning influencers, and then eventually generative AI who claim status as teacherly authority over thousands, millions of young people. So there's this transformation of teacherly authority in the digital that disrupts the ability of the parent to model teacherly authority. So that's a very deep issue." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3573)

^^ from 59:33 till 1:01:32

> "In my book Education in a Time Between Worlds, I suggest that the model of a school is not the way to think about the future of education, so I talk about these distributed educational hub networks. Because the school's already an abstract institution. Civilizationally speaking, we haven't had schools for a long time, and they mostly correlate with not cool stuff. Whereas most of education for most of human didn't exist in schools. It existed in these legitimate dynamics of teacherly authority in non-institutionalized contexts or institutionalized contexts that weren't schools. And so my vision is where the entire community or city is basically turned into a school. So Ivan Illich had this idea called a Deschooling society. I don't know if you know Illich's work or have seen his book, Deschooling Society.... It's an incredible book, and in the seventies see, I ended up basically just updating Illich and saying, "We could do this with machine learning way better." But the basic idea is that there's a time and skill sharing network and a hub of available space, probably the repurposing of the existing large public schools, which allow for every person in the community to register their skills that they'd like to teach, and every person in the community to register the things they'd like to learn. And it's as simple as that, and then every possible educational relationship that is in the community gets shuffled, and you get the creation of pop-up classrooms, and for the younger people, you get the creation of individualized sequences through the full educational potentiality of all the elders in the community. And so you take the school apart, but you make it have no walls, and then you allow the elders somehow to be free from their bullshit jobs, maybe a basic income or something. And you begin to reorient where the value is focused and the whole value of the community becomes focused on the educational actualization of the community, so that you flip the civ stack, where the whole pursuit of all the excess value goes back into the creation of the next generation's ability to pursue good value, which means making good people. So what is the civilization about? The civilization's about making good people and there's not some one little place we do that." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3922)

> "A few things are super interesting that are being experimented with, which I talk about in my book. One is aged normed social groupings. Why do we do that? No other societies did that as systematically as we do, meaning you mostly hang out for most of your childhood with kids who are basically exactly your age, by design of the adults. Whereas the one-room schoolhouse, you had all the kids mixed together of the different ages, and therefore teacherly authority was distributed throughout all of the kids because you had the older kids interacting with the younger kids in status of legitimate teacher. So the pop-up classroom model that goes across multiple ages, and that allows for much more flexibility and interaction between social groups and age groups, the impacts of that would be very hard to predict, because the type of maturity that would result from that would be unprecedented. And so just to think that as a design feature of the schools, which you don't question, which is actually quite odd and factory-like, and we still maintain it, which is just that strict segregation by chronological age." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=4136)

^^ from 1:08:56 till 1:10:03

> "I mean, that's a known thing that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it, which is to have to explain it to someone who's never learned it before. I mean, that was actually, I think Plato's definition of that you actually knew something was that you could teach it. And so there's that and just the ethical, the ethical and maturational ability to just deal with kids of different ages, even if you don't have brothers and sisters, and then of course the teacher has a different role there because the teacher is now orchestrating. And in the pop-up classroom, you're not going to have one teacher. Now, there's complex things that occur in early childhood when you need different kinds of environments that need to be built in a certain way. And of course, there's things that occur as they move into adulthood, rites of passage and other things that get them up into expert cultures. One of the main features too is though the doing of real work that needs to be done in the community by the young people, because one of the little dirty secrets about the educational system, adjacent to the competition, is that the homework doesn't mean anything. By David Graeber's definition it's a bullshit job, meaning you're doing a bunch of work, the outcome of which doesn't matter to anyone else except your own further advancement. So most of schools is a situation where the work you're doing affects no one but you. No one needs it to be done, but we don't have to have kids in that situation... The alternative to that would be kids doing internships, like picking up litter, for example, or building trails or learning how a legal firm works or doing anything that is not just route work to keep them busy in a chair all day, which they know doesn't need to be done and which the only reason they're doing it is to beat their friend in the competition to get into college. So it's like, "Whoa." If you had a distributed educational hub network where the pop-up classrooms were such that the person running the classroom was engaged in real work that needed to be done in the community, he's like, "Hey, I'm going to teach you kids about biochemistry by cleaning up this pond." Pond needs to be cleaned up, biochemistry needs to be learned, and the kid doesn't feel a sense of being told that the world's a mess, but he has to wait 17 years before he can get some kind of job and then maybe he'll be able to help with it." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=4232)

> "The kind of backdrop of a lot of my concerns is the adolescent mental health crisis, it's a legit crisis. It's another argument for some type of emergency education act that's extremely innovative, because that mental health crisis is not going to go away. It's not like all of a sudden those kids will become healthy adults. So we're looking at an entire generation that has completely unprecedented types of psychological disturbances. And again, if the entire surround is what educates and socializes, then you can't just blame the schools, and you can't just blame the phones and stuff. It's a totalizing impact on the youth that is truly destroying their will to continue to contribute to the civilization. So that means there will be a massive withdrawal of support. So, when I mentioned before something like the CCC, I believe that is the only type of thing that could be done. They don't need more psychiatric medication. They don't need more therapy. They don't need more school. They don't need more tests. They need somebody to come in and admit that the adults have made a mess and that they want the kids to help, and then actually give the kids the power and the skills and put them in positions to actually help. Otherwise, we're hypocrites, and they start to read that. That's the other reason they're pulling out. It's just the absence of legitimate discourse among the adults. Clearly the adults don't have things like, look at the election, look at COVID, look at this stuff. Why should we respect adults? So the respecting of the youth, the investing in the youth, and getting very creative about how to engage them in the fixing of real problems. Something like that, something significant with, I'm talking hundreds of millions of kids put in some type of remarkable government/private sponsored, kind of like civic work/education type thing. Not a small, a big thing, which tells a message to the youth, "We freaking care about you. We need your help. You are not a burden. You are not a problem. You are the solution. You are the future. We don't..." How do we signal that to them? Right now, we're signaling the opposite. "We're signaling we don't care about you, we can't even stop the social media guys from destroying your amygdalas. We don't care about you, we can't even get you in a school that's relevant to your future. We don't care about you, we can't even agree as adults and act like adults." So we need to be able to actually send the youth... It's one of the reasons adults actually cooperate is for the sake of the kids. So it's like, we need to send the youth a very strong signal. It's the only thing that will snap them out of it and then give them work to do. They want to work, they want to fix the world. They don't want to live in a hell hole. They want to live in a world where adults are responsible, where adults can get them into situations to help things. So it's kind of simple, but also a huge ask in terms of the type of intervention that could counteract the existing inertia and force in this direction of increasing mental discomfort in the youth. And I'm not even talking about the adults, who are also not doing well. But they're not the future. The kids are the actual future. 20 years from now, these kids who are in... These will be the leaders. Good to think about them. These will be the leaders... Who of that generation will step up to lead during the pinnacle of metacrisis, right? Who will be in that youth generation? Do we have any existing structures that are identifying that kind of youth leadership, that are creating large-scale places for youth to collaborate and work together? So that would be my hope. But it's a pretty dire situation for the youth. And the mental health crisis reveals that." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=6140)

And while they may not have wanted to work, the work was nonetheless something that they, their families, and society felt was useful, purposeful, and appreciated. In a sense, they had useful childhoods. Do children today have useful childhoods?" - [School Is Not Enough, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/)

> "I find it striking just how early and varied the avenues were that allowed promising adolescents to pivot off-script and do something different than everyone else. For a 13-year-old today, what is the equivalent of being a telegraph office boy where one can learn technology while contributing? What about for a 16-year-old? What is today’s equivalent of becoming Verrocchio’s studio apprentice at 14? Where are the studios, anyway?
>
> Modern complexity has erased some avenues for agency. After all, no boy can become a telegraph operator today. But the primary problem is not technology, it is how we have oriented the world and our expectations. A 13-year-old Steve Jobs once called Bill Hewlett—whose number was simply listed in the phone book–and received a summer job at Hewlett Packard. This would be unsurprising in Carnegie’s time, was certainly surprising for 1968, and is obviously verboten today.
>
> We have a public imagination that cannot conceive of what exactly to do with children, especially smart children. We fail to properly respect them through adolescence, so we have engineered them to be useless, and so they shuffle through a decade of busywork. Partly, the length of schooling has increased simply because it could—because we no longer need children to work, yet need them to do something while the adults go do theirs. 
>
> The sad result of school’s length and primacy is that it ensures there is nothing in particular for children to do, and since the rigid framework precludes other options, we are sure to destroy their opportunities for making meaningful contributions to the world. The longer we disallow children from having the agency to act on the world, the harder it becomes for them to visualize it in the first place. The result is that we have young adults who have a difficult time adjusting once their life-script changes even a little bit. The path is rigid, yet brittle.
>
> Much of this fault lies with the nature of school, the largest dictator of early life-scripts. Modern schooling began as a track to be left as soon as you had something worthwhile to do with your life. But it has since morphed into an attempt at systematizing as many years of a child’s life as possible, extending well into their adulthood. At the same time, school can never gratify the smartest pupils as much as either party would like, because they are charged with the education of everyone. The result is that many precocious children will spend prime years of their life quite literally waiting for other students to finish.
>
> Mass schooling attempts a systematization of skill and knowledge transfer. The results are predictably mediocre—systems at scale must function with and cater to the lowest common denominator, and the process of standardization loses all sensitivity to context. Since everyone must do the same things, it is difficult for any student to do exceptional things. This is alarming on its own for wasting people’s youth. But even worse, in having so many years of life monopolized, people come to inadvertently believe that skill and knowledge transfer are primarily the domain of school rather than a normal consequence of meaningful work.
>
> The ever-longer march through school creates a bizarre barrier separating the student from reality. As a consequence, childhood consists of the age when one can intuit very well how the world works at the same time one is prevented from acting upon it meaningfully. Instead of making adolescence full of rites of passage where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting and fake work—for school is work. After a time, all children spot this fakeness, and all honest educators note it, saying that one of the most difficult parts of teaching is having to justify why what the children are learning will be relevant and useful.
>
> It is difficult to blame young adults for thinking that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence. When meaningful work is an adult-only activity, it is little wonder that adolescence is a period of great depression. It would be surprising if it was not. Unlike the past, where many smart children finished sooner, modern education endlessly ushers them towards an often farther and more abstract future—one so far away and abstract that some children become infected with the opposite of agency. They take on a learned helplessness and downplay that the future is a reality at all.
>
> Higher education often fails to cure these deficiencies, and some people exit academia well into their twenties almost terrified to leave. How could we celebrate a form of learning that creates something so pathetic—the opposite of a readiness for life?
>
> The institutions of higher and lower education have a purpose, but they are not your friend. They have no sensitivity to context. Their incentives are not the same as your incentives, and they have no interest in any individual going off-script. They ask nothing of you but time and eventually money, but these are not trivial things. And they will take as many of your prime years as you are willing to give them. School should be leveraged only so long as meaningful work is unavailable.
>
> This is not the worship of employment, but an observation of fundamentals: it seems that the more you ask of people and the more you have them do, the more they rise up to the task of doing it on their own. While we shouldn’t allow children to be bobbin boys, no one would describe Steve Job’s summer job at 13 as his exploitation.

We are not looking for a job but opportunities for mastery: learning and practice beyond the depth one would find along the common path, which demands no such thing." - [School Is Not Enough, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/)

> "User-generated content does not need the benefit of large audiences or the approval of large broadcasting companies. Students do not need permission to attend. In corners of the internet that are easy to miss, the biggest renaissance of informal skills transfer in history is happening right now. Unlike textbooks or professors, the creators of these educational materials are willing to engage with random students throughout the world, provide feedback, and even arrange meetups—often for free.
>
> A close look at social media reveals ample opportunity for self-apprenticeship. We live in an era where a motivated 12-year-old can learn the basics of timber framing, semiconductor design, or how to bake bread that would rival world-class bakeries. They can master nearly any mechanical system or any number of programming or artistic vocations, even if no mentor lives nearby. The limit is no longer some teacher or institution but a child’s own patience and interest, as well as the interested support of the parents.
>
> Often the parents of precocious children do not appreciate this interest. They think a child engrossed in Minecraft is simply playing video games, instead of longing to build. It is the parent’s job to identify this motivation, and then leverage technology and their own resources to encourage something more meaningful. “He’s going to do great things one day.” In his thirties? Why not today?
>
> We can somewhat excuse schools for only covering topics broadly. But if education matters to a parent, then they should think hard about how they can allow their child a deep venture. Parents owe it to children to furnish them with materials, time, and useful pursuits. Schools will not supply them, and the most common failure mode with parenting is probably giving children options along the same feeble lines, and responsibilities too close to what they already have at school. 
>
> Occasionally parents might gesture towards an activity like a lemonade stand on the sidewalk to gratify a child’s interest. This example is the archetypal poor choice: A lemonade stand does not teach the value of money but how to wait and occasionally beg. To understand business or hospitality, children would be better off trying to make something people really wanted. 
>
> For example, a better home craft than lemonade might be a pastry, taken seriously. Not just a sugar cookie, but the kind of thing that is plain for a 13-year-old to understand, harder for him to make, and very difficult to master. If a child committed to a batch a day, documenting progress, perhaps he would quickly have something worth selling.
>
> And perhaps selling these at the end of the street won’t work, but it might work selling them somewhere repeatable and meaningful, like at a local soccer practice. Leveraging existing technology and a supportive parent, there’s no reason a young teenager couldn’t make thousands this way while perfecting the mastery of something deeper than school would ever teach at the same age.
>
> Pastries come to mind as an example because Pierre Hermé, one of the most famous pastry chefs and chocolatiers in the world, began as an apprentice at 14. This is admirable, but it would be a shame for us to wait around for some mentor to appear. The ultimate mentor is always the parent and the resources are broader than ever. What can your child make today? What can he do that’s both rewarding and difficult? What can you do to facilitate such a thing? Or if you’re young enough yourself—what can you master?
>
> The goal is not to invent a job but to create a path to mastery or responsibility. If a child can sell the fruit of his labor, so much the better. But the essential lesson is that every difficult thing attempted acts as a multiplier on his confidence and the rest of his knowledge. Drudgery is sometimes confused with building character, and I think this is a mistake. It is building skill that builds self-possession. After selling thousands of dollars worth of pastries over the summer, a child does not only know that he can make pastries. He knows that he can make anything.
>
> I think that it is worth some special reflection as to why programming is now the typical industry for precocious children. In many ways, it has a low bar to entry and is something that parents still allow their children to do despite the hour-demands of systematized schooling. It is one of the few industries with an immensely permissionless culture. You don’t need an audience or patrons. You don’t have to ask anyone. You don’t have to get a building permit or any professional resources. You can just create. The advantages of this, especially for some children who are not allowed to do much else with their time, are immense. We should ask ourselves, slowly, carefully, and often: what else can be like that?
>
> It would be most desirable if there were a formula for instilling mastery, a guide of recipes and options for every child or young adult. But so long as society is committed to treating children unseriously, the obvious apprenticeships will be few. There may be more varied options than ever for any given child, but none of them will come to him on their own. They will lie just off the path, and the child will need to go looking. One reason that schools will always do poorly at finding such opportunities for children is that the very best opportunities will always be a response to local needs—a sensitivity to context is precisely the thing that systems of scale fail at producing. But both parent and child should never confuse this with a lack of options. Our era is resource-rich, including educational resources, but onramp poor. The legwork is up to you.
>
> Many fairy tales and stories are about finding one’s place. The hero begins as a child full of wonder and ends up achieving mastery over the world. Visions of the future need to allow people—not just the cleverest among us, but all people—to imagine accepting a place in the world. If we fail to do this during the years of education, then we are not really educating. If we fail to allow children continuous contact with the world, we risk them coming to see their own lives as mere abstractions.
>
> The purpose of education is to develop agency within a child. Purposeful work and achieving mastery are tools to getting there. They aren’t the results of learning and imagination, it’s the other way around—learning is simply the consequence of doing. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters genius and talent." - [School Is Not Enough, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/)

> "Modernism, so conceived, is a bankrupt paradigm. Yes, we can be nuanced, and should be, recognizing that it also brought with it many emancipations, cured many ills and diseases, added many comforts and luxuries, and generally allowed people the opportunity to explore self-actualization as they never could before. For these reasons, metamodernism embraces and takes up the genuine insights of modernism into its worldview. But it also takes up its postmodern critique, which is valid and urgently necessary. For, as we speak, the very suburban wastelands I’ve just described are still spreading, growing, “developing” across the globe.

> "Let’s come back to Earth for a minute—to the work of very serious sociologists. As early as the 1980s, they were recognizing that they could no longer ignore the effect their own theories were having on, well, society. In a cycle very much like the “observer effect” from quantum physics, sociology influences what it seeks to objectively measure. Theories about culture wind up affecting culture. Recognition of this “double hermeneutic” has led to the emergence of so-called “reflexive sociology”: a discipline for sociologists to study the impact of sociology itself on society.
>
> This is not ivory tower abstraction, but very real stuff. Just think about the revolution in gender norms among members of Gen Z. The very language millions of tweens and teenagers are using to formulate their lived sense of identity comes less and less from their immediate familial or community circle and more and more from academic paradigms that critically reflect upon culture. Eleven-year-olds are coming of age using the paradigms of social constructivism. The postmodern deconstruction of culture is increasingly becoming the means of enculturation itself as younger generations are being socialized via sociology. Just consider that the 2023 summer blockbuster Barbie movie wound up being a fun-for-the-whole-family meta-reflection on issues of patriarchy and feminism.
>
> This is simply itself a reflection, not a judgment, and is in no way intended to echo conservative laments about the loss of childish innocence to those “neo-Marxist postmodernists” spreading their “critical theory” in the schools. But the very fact that such popular jeremiads identify postmodernism itself as a boogeyman that everyone has heard of only underscores the point. Cultural theory is not just in the ivory tower but deeply permeates culture itself." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=let%E2%80%99s%20come%20back,permeates%20culture%20itself.)

> "In sum, what “metamodernism” speaks to, I am suggesting, is 1) the cultural moment when the deep recursive process of iterative self-reflection is applied to postmodernism, and thus constitutes an advance beyond the postmodern that includes many of its strategies. In the process, metamodernism becomes 2) the cultural moment when this deep recursive process in cultural shifts becomes an explicit object of reflection and the basis of a new way of seeing. Metamodernism thus becomes a cultural logic about (meta) cultural logics. Thus, with the awareness of the full implications of “going meta” in eternal recursive reflection, metamodernism entails the necessary inclusion within it of all prior cultural logics (at least insofar as it contains representations of their information in its complexity from a higher vantage). In this way, metamodernism signals an inherently multi-perspectival perspective, one that recognizes its inherent ability to toggle in and out of its own recursive contents.
>
> While postmodernism had recognized plurality, metamodernism recognizes the nested nature of this plurality, the Russian doll structure that allows the metamodernist to relate multiple perspectives to each other and to its own vantage. This is what allows it to move beyond the radical relativity and value nihilism of postmodern pluralism, as transcendence returns as a viable and indeed fundamental aspect of reality. Recursive reflection allows the metamodernist to contextualize different contexts by the ordering and relating of perspectives—including the postmodern one." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=In%20sum%2C%20what,the%20postmodern%20one.)

> "Cultural logics able to master the logic of others by self-recursively applying those logics to themselves to yield new insights reveal themselves as being more critical, more complex, more informationally rich. In short, while there is no absolute standard by which to judge a cultural logic, there is a relative one: namely, How many of the other cultural logics it can nest within its own logic." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=Cultural%20logics%20able,its%20own%20logic.)

> "With the postmodern perspective now reified like all the rest, it becomes objectified as an available (but not absolute) lens in its arsenal of different lenses. That is, its lens no longer dominates the entire field of vision. Postmodern skepticism and relativism are a way of seeing—and a highly complex one at that—but not the only way. And, indeed, by its ability to take the postmodern relativist view, but then reduplicate its own logic on itself in such a way as to engender a nonrelativistic vantage that relativizes relativism and contextualizes contexts, metamodernism proves its superiority to the less critical, less self-aware lens of the postmodern. Compared to the metamodern, the postmodern is still employing a particular lens uncritically as an absolute and has not yet decentered enough from its perspective to take it as an object. Metamodernism, though, can take postmodernism as an object, getting outside its vantage in a manner that allows it to recursively apply its own logic to it, and thereby produce something new.
>
> In sum, metamodernism reflects a cultural logic of cultural logics. It is the cultural logic in which the recursive reflection driving the advance of cultural logics becomes itself an object of awareness within the cultural logic. It signals the advance to a perspective that can take perspective on the advance of perspectives. It thus regains modern-style directionality and progress, but without its totalizing impulse. For it arises through an eternal self-transcendence to an awareness of eternal self-transcendence that, as soon as it is realized, abolishes its own status among the transcendent by becoming aware that it will be transcended. It thus represents the transcending process becoming aware of itself and, just as soon as it is seen, passes into the immanent, the finite, the untranscended." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=With%20the%20postmodern,finite%2C%20the%20untranscended)

> "In the language of complexity science, metamodernism is an “attractor,” a pattern of behavior a system will gravitate towards based on deep structural relationships. But this is also what an “episteme” essentially is in Foucauldian terms! Indeed, most of the terms used to define metamodernism gesture to some version of this idea. It is what is suggested by words like “cultural logic,” “cultural code,” “structure of feeling,” etc. There is a pattern at play, the patterning activity by which we can justifiably speak of process social kinds and constructions. And, as Azarian notes, that pattern rhymes at various levels of analysis. So we see it operating in the arts one minute, in science the next, and so forth. My claim throughout this book is that metamodernism, as a cultural logic, is both a product of that pattern and about it. And the more it unfolds, the more it reveals the pattern, such that the pattern in turn becomes objectified, reflected upon, and eventually contextualized within a still more comprehensive pattern." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/chapter-6-worldview-from-metamodernism#:~:text=In%20the%20language,more%20comprehensive%20pattern.)

> "My point is that research paradigms are only symptomatic of broader cultural trends. That metamodernism, like postmodernism before it, manifests as an academic paradigm suggests its manifestation as a cultural paradigm, an episteme, a collective justification system, etc. The upshot of all of this is that we can be both meticulous and broad in our scope when talking about cultural logics. Metamodernism may indeed operate as a philosophical paradigm, but it is also much more than that. As a logic, a structure, a set of patterns, it is applicable to a wide sphere of life. Just as postmodernism manifests as a philosophical paradigm, that paradigm both informs and is informed by people applying its logic to all aspects of their lives.
>
> Appreciating this justifies our speaking of metamodernism in expansive terms. The word I use, though imperfect—yet for which I have found no better substitute—is worldview, by which I do not mean a perfectly coherent set of beliefs, nor an arbitrary assortment of commitments. Rather, I use the term largely interchangeably with other terms encountered here such as “justification system,” “episteme,” or “metameme.” It is a constellation of working assumptions about the world acting as knowledge, by means of which people navigate reality in a relatively effective manner. In this sense, it is very much in accord with Azarian’s understanding of a “cultural worldview” that acts as a shared world model as part of collective adaptive strategies.
>
> This does not mean worldviews are reducible to evolutionary biology. As Henriques shows, worldviews are part of symbolic information processing systems that build off of living and neuronal ones but are not reducible to them. A worldview is how we make sense of reality via collective representations we share with other symbolically-mediated, cultural, human persons. Working together, “thinking together,” we live out the universe’s propensity towards thermodynamic efficiency, which is to say the universe’s drive to process more information and create more structural complexity. It is how we, as a part of the universe, learn more about the universe in a manner that aids our viability. Worldviews, and worldview evolution, are part of the process of cosmic complexification. They are what recursive emergence looks like on the plane of Culture. They are patterns of information—i.e., clusters of powers or common patterns of similarity and difference—that arise out of the integrated insights of countless minds all reflecting on themselves, each other, and the world in which they finds themselves.
>
> As both Storm and Freinacht note, drawing on the insights of developmental psychology, we do this by going out into the world and interacting and manipulating it. Human thinkers are not isolated from the world but emerge out of it, are parts of it, and metamodern semiotics and epistemology naturally reflect this. We are the parts of the universe that have proven exceedingly successful at self-reflection. For that is what the universe seems to be doing at every level: recursively looping back on itself to generate new emergent levels, which move further and further away from the boring predictability of “natural kinds” towards the ever-more exciting dynamism and novelty of social kinds, cultural kinds.
>
> That is what transcendence is all about. An infinitesimal progress towards greater and greater dimensionality. An endless decentration towards deeper levels of complexity. An eternal recursion of reflection, allowing us to toggle between more perspectives and vantages as we bootstrap our way to greater knowledge of the universe.
>
> These are the meta-patterns anchoring the properties of the metamodern worldview. But by reflecting upon them, our very notion of the world and our place in it is transformed. Postmodernism is also a worldview—but one that often suffers from nihilism and meaninglessness owing to the vertiginous relativism brought on by the realization of perspectival pluralism. It is the worldview of Rick Sanchez, of Jobu Tupaki, which says “Nothing… matters.” That may be a philosophical conclusion, I suppose, but it definitely affects the way people live their lives.
>
> The metamodern worldview is different. It moves beyond the cultural logic of postmodernism, transcending it, to find something aspirational, hopeful, meaningful on the other side. It brings a logic to the chaos of the infinite. It offers a sense of home, a way to appreciate simplicity on the other side of complexity. It doesn’t mock but affirms single-entendre principles like love, care, and kindness. And it does so without forfeiting its reflective gains. It reclaims a sense of progress, of directionality, of purpose, yet does so without premodern dogma or modern totalitarianism.
>
> In all of this, clearly, a profound sense of optimism seems to obtain—or, like “pragmatic idealism,” a sort of metarealist positivity. While I certainly risk overstating the case, it seems that one thing all articulations of metamodernism have in common is its distinctly affirmational and productive stance compared to its postmodern predecessor. We see it in the earnest affect of metamodern aesthetics, in the reimagined sense of progress and purpose in metamodern political and social movements, in the switch from philosophy “under the sign of the negative” to the positive in metamodern philosophy, etc. The dialectic is advancing, negation is being negated, and the reconstructive manifestations are appearing at the cutting edge of culture in aesthetics, social activism, philosophy, the sciences, religion, and beyond." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/chapter-6-worldview-from-metamodernism#:~:text=My%20point%20is,religion%2C%20and%20beyond.)

> Today’s elites are not only denying that they’re elite, they’re denying other people the opportunity to become elite by claiming it’s impossible, minimizing the effects of hard work, or celebrating the opposite of what they practice.

> In not wanting to champion, say, fitness, marriage, and hard work, elites end up encouraging [fat pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_acceptance_movement), [divorce](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/12/divorce-parenting/621054/), and [anti-work](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220126-the-rise-of-the-anti-work-movement)—all while being fit, married, and hard-working themselves.
