> "Tomasello et al tested human toddlers vs. apes on a series of traditional IQ type questions. The match-up was surprisingly fair; in areas like memory, logic, and spatial reasoning, the three species did about the same. But in ability to learn from another person, humans wiped the floor with the other two ape species." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Tomasello%20et%20al,two%20ape%20species%3A)

> "In the Cultural Intelligence Hypothesis, humans live in obligate symbiosis with a culture. A brain without an associated culture is incomplete and not very useful. So the infant brain is adapted to seek out the important aspects of its local culture almost from birth and fill them into the appropriate slots in order to become whole." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=In%20the%20Cultural,to%20become%20whole.)

> "Learn from people who are good at things and/or widely-respected... People will fear and obey authority figures like kings and chieftains, but they give a different kind of respect (“prestige”) to people who seem good at things. And since it’s hard to figure out who’s good at things (can a non-musician who wants to start learning music tell the difference between a merely good performer and one of the world’s best?) most people use the heuristic of respecting the people who other people respect. Once you identify someone as respect-worthy, you strongly consider copying them in, well, everything." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=Learn%20from%20people,in%2C%20well%2C%20everything)

> "A naïve learner can’t tell all the causal links between an individual’s practices and his success. As a consequence, learners often copy their chosen models broadly across many domains. Of course, learners may place more weight on domains that for one reason or other seem more causally relevant to the model’s success. This copying often includes the model’s personal habits or styles as well as their goals and motivations, since these may be linked to their success. This “if in doubt, copy it” heuristic is one of the reasons why success in one domain converts to influence across a broad range of domains.

> The immense range of celebrity endorsements in modern societies shows the power of prestige. For example, NBA star Lebron James, who went directly from High School to the pros, gets paid millions to endorse State Farm Insurance. Though a stunning basketball talent, it’s unclear why Mr. James is qualified to recommend insurance companies. Similarly, Michael Jordan famously wore Hanes underwear and apparently Tiger Woods drove Buicks. Beyonce’ drinks Pepsi (at least in commercials). What’s the connection between musical talent and sugary cola beverages?

> Finally, while new medical findings and public educational campaigns only gradually influence women’s approach to preventive medicine, Angelina Jolie’s single OP-ED in the New York Times, describing her decision to get a preventive double mastectomy after learning she had the ‘faulty’ BRCA1 gene, flooded clinics from the U.K. to New Zealand with women seeking genetic screenings for breast cancer. Thus, an unwanted evolutionary side effect, prestige turns out to be worth millions, and represents a powerful and underutilized public health tool." - [The Secret of Our Success](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=A%20na%C3%AFve%20learner,public%20health%20tool.)

> "Here is an outline of what I mean by cultural evolution:
>
> - Human culture includes language, artifacts, music, stories, rituals, behaviors, and other information stored inside and outside of human brains.
>
> - Humans acquire culture through social learning. There are two major pathways of transmission: vertical, from parents to children only, or horizontal, between unrelated people. The mode of transmission is itself a major selective factor, shaping the content of culture.
>
> - Culture cannot survive and reproduce itself without humans; humans, after long dependence on culture, can no longer survive and reproduce themselves without it.
>
> - Cultures vary and change, and experience differential “reproductive” success: they spread or fail to spread, and their host populations grow or shrink.
>
> - Biological organisms only change by selection on random mutations. Culture, on the other hand, varies in part through intentional (non-random) human action. Despite this, it is rarely the case that humans fully understand all the functions of their culture, or predict how any changes they make will affect them and their descendants. (See, e.g., Alex Mesoudi, Foresight in cultural evolution.)

> - The relationship between humans and their culture is best modeled as a relationship between host and symbiote or between host and parasite, depending on the fitness cost extracted by culture, with humans as the host." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=here%20is%20an,as%20the%20host.)

> "Culture is not a luxury; it is life or death. Culture has likely been the most important part of the human selective environment for hundreds of thousands of years. Humans are not adapted to life without culture...

> Humans rely on culture to survive not only in marginal environments, but even in environments rich with resources, such as the Australian outback. People rely on culture to obtain sources of food, and also to eat their food safely" - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/)

> "The evolution of religion is one of the most interesting and ignored areas of cultural evolution. We tend to exaggerate the degree of rationality and conscious thought in human life, ignoring the enormous and influential contribution of magical thinking. Just as there are vital amines (vitamins) that human cultures must figure out how to supply us with, there are social and cognitive equivalents; modernity may do as poor a job supplying us with social belonging and ritual as it does supplying us with proper nutrition." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=The%20evolution%20of%20religion,us%20with%20proper%20nutrition.)

> "While unselfconscious evolution with limited foresight can no longer be relied upon to produce solutions of good fit, an understanding of evolutionary processes is essential to producing such fit. In particular, the constraints that have not changed for humans – nutritional, social, and cognitive – must be recognized, and old, hard-won solutions to these constraints must be seriously considered as essential building blocks of  synthetic, selfconsciously-designed solutions to human flourishing." - [Why Cultural Evolution Is Real (And What It Is)](https://carcinisation.com/2014/11/22/why-cultural-evolution-is-real-and-what-it-is/#:~:text=While%20unselfconscious%20evolution,to%20human%20flourishing.)







> "Innovations are instead an emergent property of our species’ cultural learning abilities, applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality, (ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Brains evolved for, and entirely dependent on, the acquisition of culture — cultural brains. Our cultural brains evolved in tandem with our collective brains, and are rather limited in isolation. Indeed, there are numerous examples of the failure of big-brained explorers to survive in new environments without access to cumulative bodies of cultural know-how." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Social learners can acquire more adaptive knowledge at a lower cost, and without having to generate the information, do so with a smaller brain. Larger groups of social learners with more adaptive knowledge create a selection pressure for an extended juvenile period to acquire this knowledge. Under some circumstances, this can lead to oblique learning and selective biases to distinguish who to learn from—the human pathway to truly cultural brains." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Human brains have evolved with an ability and proclivity for selective, high fidelity social learning. In a world of imperfect cues for the adaptive value of culture, there are a variety of strategies and biases that have evolved to hone in on the most adaptive knowledge. These strategies and biases include direct and indirect cues of the popularity of cultural traits (e.g. conformist transmission bias), direct and indirect cues that a potential model has adaptive know-how worth learning (e.g. success and prestige biases), filtering mechanisms to assess the accuracy of information and sincerity of models (e.g. credibility enhancing displays), personal relevance of culture and biases toward certain content (e.g. dangerous animals, the edibility of plants, fire and gossip)." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Like the neural networks of the biological brain, the social networks of the collective brain have underlying structures. Collective brains differ in many ways: size, interconnectivity, network properties, social groupings and so on. As cross-cultural research reveals, collective brains also differ in the psychology of their constituent cultural brains. For example, some societies have a higher level of xenophobia with potential implications for the inflow of ideas from outgroups. Societies also differ in ‘tightness’ and ‘looseness’—their openness to divergent ideas—with consequent effects for cultural variance." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Not only is human culture beyond individual invention, but it also does not require its beneficiaries to understand why something works." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "At an individual level, a collective brain perspective suggests that individual innovation benefits from exposure to a wide array of ideas, beliefs, values, mental models and so on. This is part of what creates a ‘prepared mind’. Einstein, for example, was exposed to many ideas working at a patent office. Much of his work related to evaluating patents on electrical devices, including those related to the synchronization of time, which made later appearances in his thought experiments. Einstein cultivated a wide network, regularly travelling and forming friendships with the leading scientists of his day. At the level of the collective brain, there are many factors that affect the overall rate of innovation and diffusion." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

^^ we need to make as much knowledge common - private knowledge is a symptom of misalignment and slows everyone down

> "Economists typically assume material incentives drive innovators and thus innovations. However, from our point of view, recombination and incremental improvements are critical to innovation and patents can also stifle these processes by inhibiting the flow of information across individual minds, instead incentivizing secrecy. Consistent with this, historical analyses of patent laws by Moser and recent analyses of human gene patents by Williams both suggest that patent laws may often be too strong, reducing innovation, but this does not mean no patents would lead to more innovation. Based on data on pharmaceutical patents in 92 countries from 1978 to 1992, Qian argues that there may be an optimal level of protection, after which innovation is stifled. Increasing innovation is about empowering the collective brain." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Reducing the costs of failure by creating a safety net can influence innovation via multiple channels, including by allowing individuals to invest in broader social ties (expanding the collective brain) over kin ties and by increasing entrepreneurship directly. This relationship is supported by analyses of England’s old poor law, more forgiving bankruptcy laws across 15 countries, unemployment insurance in France and in the USA, the introduction of food stamps, health insurance for children and access to health insurance unbundled from employment, all of which increased entrepreneurship. Of course, there is an optimal amount of social insurance vis-à-vis innovation, because increased funding of such programmes can increase tax burdens—some data suggest that higher corporate taxes can lead to lower entrepreneurship. Overall, social safety nets energize innovation because they permit individuals to interconnect in broader, richer, networks." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although we have discussed sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance separately, they are interrelated. For example, sociality may have little effect if a task is too simple and therefore, transmission fidelity is very high or individual learning dominates solutions. Similarly, theoretical and experimental research with social network structures suggests that too much interconnectivity can decrease variance. The trade-off is between interconnectivity increasing the probability of useful recombinations in the incredibly high dimensional space of cultural combinations and the reductions in variance caused by our selective biases applying to large portions of the population. These results and the collective brain perspective suggest an optimal amount of interconnectivity. However, because real societal networks are far less dense than laboratory networks and we are far from a completely connected network, human society will probably continue to benefit from increases in interconnectivity (i.e. we are still on the positive slope). Moreover, variance is introduced by other factors, such as mistakes in transmission and individual differences in social learning and conformist biases (e.g. higher IQ individuals may be less conformist). Finally, the same principles that lead to larger populations possessing more complex technologies can also shape and hone the mechanisms of cultural transmission, such as pedagogy and language." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Changes in languages can dramatically improve the efficiency of collective brains, just as myelination can make neural pathways more efficient over ontogeny. There are many ways that cultural evolution can optimize or make languages more useful. These include larger vocabularies, bigger phonemic inventories, more grammatical tools and more learnable syntactic morphologies.. In the laboratory... artificial language transmission experiments reveal that over generations, these languages structurally change to become more learnable." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "In addition to language, cultural evolution may also be tuning the structures of the collective brain and the factors that affect sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance. This tuning may offset a problem Mesoudi discusses, whereby as cultural complexity increases, it is more difficult for each generation to acquire the growing and more complex body of adaptive knowledge. Consistent with this tuning, large-scale societies, with more complex technologies, engage in more teaching than small-scale societies, thereby increasing transmission fidelity as cultural complexity increases. There is also some evidence for increases in division of labour (increased specialization), with more international trade and more domestic outsourcing of tasks (i.e. less vertical integration of all aspects of a business). Despite these increases in pedagogy and specialization, our ‘extended juvenile period’ has become further extended with delayed age of first child and longer formal education. Finally, Americans continue to expand their vocabularies across their adult lives, which has expanded the difference in the verbal IQs between adolescents and their parents relative to prior generations, where vocabularies expanded little after the mid-twenties." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance all vary across populations and are subject to cultural evolution along a variety of dimensions. Over time, higher intergroup competition may favour institutions, such as social safety nets, that generate innovations. These factors affect the many ways in which innovations arise, such as exposure to more ideas (via cultural models prior to mass communication technologies), mistakes in transmission and serendipity through fiddling around. If these processes are the primary mechanisms through which innovations arise, then it would help explain the prevalence of Newton –Liebniz and Darwin–Wallace-type controversies. Yet, in a population of millions, it was only Newton and Liebniz who discovered calculus, only Darwin and Wallace who developed the theory of evolution by natural selection; only a handful of people who actually invented each technology. Does the collective brain really relegate the specific innovator to a fungible node at a nexus in the social network? Do cognitive abilities, like IQ or executive function, really play no part?" - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Collective brains make their constituent cultural brains more cognitively skilled in surviving in the local environment and better able to solve novel problems, using a larger repertoire of accumulated abilities. Intelligence is often assumed to underlie both individual and population differences in creativity and innovation. While, in principle, intelligence may increase transmission fidelity, intelligence (as measured by IQ) is only weakly correlated with innovativeness (as measured by creativity), r = 0.20, and is at best a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. Based on the arguments outlined in §3a, we should expect that the collective brain can make cultural brains smarter through a combination of exposure to more ideas (sociality), better learning (transmission fidelity) and willingness to deviate (transmission variance). Of these three factors, exposure to more ideas is a necessary condition, because higher fidelity by itself would be associated only with incremental improvements and increased transmission variance by itself would be associated with more ideas, most of which would be bad." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "For a species so dependent on accumulated knowledge, not only is the idea of a ‘culture-free’ IQ test meaningless, but also the idea of ‘culture-free’ IQ. Our smarts are substantially culturally acquired in ways that alter both our brains and biology, and cannot meaningfully be measured or understood independent of culture." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although some have argued for a causal relationship between IQ and development, the theory and evidence we have laid out so far suggest the opposite causal direction. Sociality (the size and interconnectedness of a population) leads to increased cultural complexity. Increased cultural complexity in turn smartens cultural brains by giving them access to a wider array of information, including physical, cognitive and linguistic tools, which may be recombined in new ways, generating new innovations. All of this is not to say that individual cognitive differences are unimportant to invention and innovation, only that these differences, like innovation, are an emergent property of the collective brain and that the focus on IQ, genius and other individual differences, as the source of innovation have missed the broader collective brain processes that explain within-group and between-group differences." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Educational psychology shows how learning some skills improve the acquisition of others. Exposure to Socratic questioning improves critical thinking more generally; learning the method of loci (attaching items to a physical location in memory) improves performance on memory tests; and exposure to the history of Darwin’s thought processes lead to a greater understanding of evolution. These may seem obvious, but demonstrate how exposure to new techniques and ideas can affect the acquisition of other techniques and ideas." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "The invention of these technologies also allows us to better understand the principles that underlie them—understanding the thermodynamics of a steam engine is a lot easier when you actually have a steam engine! We use our technologies as metaphors, analogies and concepts and they allow us to understand and innovate in ways we could not without such culture. The way in which ideas have shaped each other is a neglected aspect of cultural evolution, because it can be difficult to study." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

According to John Stewart we need an escalator to meta-systemic cognition - to have a path for anyone to raise their awareness and understanding of our place in the developmental process and the forces within it
A cultural enlightenment

We are all complicit in ignorance
we need to upgrade our capacity to learn
We are failing at raising humans

Humans are LLMs - you poke poke and stuff comes out, and they go through very suboptimal life-long training

Learning should be a joy - an honor

What if our games taught skills that the GB needs?

We must consciously raise the awareness and education of the so-called masses

TODO: quote from here (from a teacher in NY) about how broken public schooling is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw
Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast
from minute 9:44 till 13:05

Its all about education - it never stops - not just 24 years - for life. For anything. At any time.

What if school work was not something that ends up thrown away but was aimed at contributing to society? What if all their work was meaningful and not thrown away once graded? They feel like their work is pointless & ineffectual. They're forced into non-seriousness. We're creating a kind of immaturity. (All thoughts from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast)

Harvard is a perverse concept

One upside of having kids learn & compete on serious real world issues in public building a track record is that by the time they're 25-30 they'll have more to show and prove than most 40-50 year olds and could make a serious claim to legitimacy in governance - a way to fix our gerintocracy.

The root of the metacrisis is an education crisis (Zak Stein)
also a legitimation & teacherly authority crisis - its not just a technological problem
Education is the autopoietic root of society - the way it propagates/maintains/reproduces itself

> "The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools. The right answer depends on two things, and two things alone: the existence of shared narratives and the capacity of such narratives to provide an inspired reason for schooling." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1364209-public-education-does-not-serve-a-public-it-creates-a#:~:text=The%20question%20is,reason%20for%20schooling.)

>
> Because our new elites are foxes and not lions, they no longer feel comfortable celebrating productive habits for the rest of society.
>
> Our old elites used to share a sense of common responsibility and noblesse oblige — not just to give back, but to expect the masses to act in a way that would let them rise up as well. Old elites knew that on average they had more productive habits than the masses (e.g. marital fidelity, two-parent households, steady employment, etc), and so it was thus their job to provide the masses an example to aspire to.
>
> But our new elites are less likely to admit they’re more productive; if anything, they deny it. While this humility seems generous on the surface — it’s nicer to imply that elites are successful solely because of privilege and not also because they’re more productive — this also denies the elites of any responsibility to the masses.
>
> To be sure, new elites do recognize their privilege, but this only necessitates that they give resources, not that they also need to transmit the right habits. So they try to provide a safety net which is great, but they don’t bestow the behaviors that would help the masses best utilize that safety net after they get it.

While reversing the direction of stigma may be helpful for the struggling person who can’t change their circumstance, it may also make it harder for the struggling person who can improve their condition to get help.

> Of course, we should try to find a way to have strong norms without shaming people. If we need to keep certain stigmas, we should also try to solve for their downsides. After all, there are many injustices that people can’t change, that they’re suffering through due to no fault of their own.
