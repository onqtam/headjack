> "Because of the Existence Bias, for example, we don’t have a plan for the future of the human race. That’s odd, because our existence is built upon obsessive planning. It helps us get what we want. Accordingly, we plan for everything: social events, marriage, education, vacations, careers, health, war and even death. So why don’t we have a plan for the human race? Whether we like it or not, nearly 8 billion of us are interconnected, comprising a vast orchestra, each contributing to a collective fate." - [13 Steps to Cognitive “Perfection”, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/13-steps-to-cognitive-perfection-86e316569c3f#:~:text=Because%20of%20the,a%20collective%20fate.)

> "Belief systems are the gears of society, determining speed and torque. They’re the most powerful technology to facilitate mass human cooperation and also one of our biggest liabilities. Belief systems are also serious business. More people have died from conflict over belief systems than any other cause in history." - [A Plan For Humanity, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/a-plan-for-humanity-2bc04088e3d4#:~:text=Belief%20systems%20are,cause%20in%20history.)

The answer is growth that maximizes planetary complexity while minimizing the degree to which any entropy not re-usable somewhere else as a source of free energy remains within planetary bounds." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1726787146907037889)

> "When we think about AI, we imagine it as being capable of becoming and doing anything, yet, when it comes to our own potential, we’re woefully unambitious and unimaginative. There is no reason we can’t be as ambitious about our own potential as we are about the potential development of AI." - [A Plan For Humanity, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/a-plan-for-humanity-2bc04088e3d4#:~:text=When%20we%20think,development%20of%20AI.)
