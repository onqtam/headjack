> "What is the most important piece of historical knowledge lost in the past century? It is impossible to say because if we knew the answer, the knowledge would probably not be lost. What does all this mean for the overall trajectory of our knowledge of history? Unfortunately, on average our understanding of any given period will slowly get worse over time. Our direct evidence will gradually decay, with some temporary reversals as lost material is rediscovered. But over the long term, it is impossible for rediscoveries to outpace losses. Meanwhile, the quality of historians’ arguments and interpretations will vary somewhat, sometimes getting better and sometimes getting worse. To take a grossly oversimplified mathematical analogy, imagine a sine wave of analytical quality fluctuating around an exponential decay curve of surviving evidence." - [Our Knowledge of History Decays Over Time, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/03/07/our-knowledge-of-history-decays-over-time/#:~:text=What%20is%20the,of%20surviving%20evidence.)

# History 2.0: the ledger of record

In the current web documents are [host-certified](host_centric.md#the-host-centric-web--its-decay) and we refer to data by location instead of contents. Here we'll expand on problems with the status quo and list the benefits of building a [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) at web-scale through [data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing & [self-authenticating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document) documents tied to identity.

# Authenticity

We'll be able to computationally verify the authenticity of any document & tie it to an identity as long as we also have the proofs for it - giving birth to the [ledger of record](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088) where argument from cryptography begins superseding argument from authority.

Anyone might have saved a specific document (& updates to it) locally along with the necessary proofs for authenticity even if most infrastructure no longer stores/serves it. There is a `1 of N` guarantee which allows documents that someone wants buried to be passed around with proofs and resurface in the public at a later point - improving accountability.

<!-- 
TODO:
In such an environment controversial and false claims are much easier to prove.
If even intranets and corps move to this addressing then whistpeblowing will be much more authentic. This is the mechanism for the biggest crimes to bubble up

The ability to do specific verifiable attribution to where a harm is coming from can increase our capacity to serve justice
Forced transparency !!!

# History 2.0

> "Cryptographically verifiable history is the next step after written history" - [@balajis](https://youtu.be/VeH7qKZr0WI?t=10089)



We could establish global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) through authenticity, reputation, and the ledger of record.

Another important aspect in improving coordination is to build applications that will help in forming common knowledge:

"The great privilege of the elites of the future will be to erase the computer information about them and assume their private identity again." - Marshall McLuhan

> "Common knowledge is often important for coordination. For example, a group of people might want to speak out about an issue, but only feel comfortable doing so if there’s enough of them speaking out at the same time that they have safety in numbers." [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html)


no mentioned "fact" shall remain unanchored/unreferenced - that's what stable URIs and intra-document addressing are for


> "We are choked with news and starved of history." - [Will Durant](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8716601-we-are-choked-with-news-and-starved-of-history)


> "Perhaps better history needs better databases." - [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1434110543564996612)
-->


# The global [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)

Headjack is a global [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) with different data availability tradeoffs - storage and retrievability are not guaranteed. If someone processes everything that's linked to the blockchain they'd be able to track the creation and changes of each document - both the edits from the original authors and the forks & references from others, and also the sequence of authorizations that update who has authority to edit a document. All events are cryptographically sealed in time with on-chain commitments and the history cannot be tampered with.

We should be able to view the changes of any document with a diff view - similarly to what [The Internet Archive provides](https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/) (see [this as an example](https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches)) but with a lot more control and a wide range of different visualization tools - example: a slider for filtering/jumping through time [like in Discourse](
https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096).

> "The public’s interest in seeing what’s changed—or at least being aware that a change has been made and why—is as legitimate as it is diffuse. And because it’s diffuse, few people are naturally in a position to speak on its behalf." - [source](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/)

We ought to rebuild everything on top of this [ledger of record](cryptohistory.md#authenticity) - including Wikipedia (no more dead links!), open source code, science and peer review - under one global interlinked namespace where any public event is referencable so that others can comment on it.

# The history of document updates

Today's web puts authenticity & certification of documents in the [hands of hosts](host_centric.md#the-host-centric-web--its-decay) which can [do whatever they want](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27690525) and rarely provide the option to see previous versions if edits have been made. The [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive) is hardly a mainstream tool which doesn't provide any cryptographic authenticity guarantees and can be compromised.

> "It is really tempting to cover for mistakes by pretending they never happened. Our technology now makes that alarmingly simple" - [source](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/)

> "Society can’t understand itself if it can’t be honest with itself, and it can’t be honest with itself if it can only live in the present moment. It’s long overdue to affirm and enact the policies and technologies that will let us see where we’ve been, including and especially where we’ve erred, so we might have a coherent sense of where we are and where we want to go." - [source](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/)

In Headjack updates to URIs are broadcasted but the previous versions remain - applications ought to display the latest state but should allow browsing the entire history of changes - like using Git.

# Deduplicating documents & traceability

An open paradigm with content addressing where data is shared between services would enable us to de-duplicate re-uploads as long as they are the same documents in terms of bytes because of the open nature of data - based on their hash. We'll be able to see when something first appeared & the discussion will be much less fractured between platforms and posts - leading to greater depth.

We'll be able to more easily [address parts of documents](names_and_paths.md#addressing-within-content) and share ranges of entire videos without having to re-upload them as separate clips which breaks the contextual link. If this becomes as easy as (or even easier than) it currently is to crop & re-upload, then it will become the norm - we'll all prefer not losing the context. In this paradigm [deepfakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake) will be easier to spot & fight - tracing the source of content authentically to identity is important & desirable.

TODO: regarding deepfakes - only official statements could be traced - unofficial leaks will still be unprovable

# Verifiable credentials

Entities can sign messages that attest facts about other accounts - the creation of such [verifiable credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials) doesn't have to happen on-chain - they can be issued off-chain with a message that's only anchored on-chain and has a URI. [`"issuance is common, revocation is rare"`](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html#modifying-and-revoking-attestations) - later revocations & updates can be handled in one of 2 ways:
- On-chain revocation/updates: if the attestations are uniquely numbered with a counter from the issuer using a [nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce), then the Headjack state can be extended to support a special `revocation list` field in which the chain can record revocations at specific blocks - then the validity of said attestations will be checkable with a single query to the blockchain state. For updates there would be a second list and in order to check the validity for an attestation after an update has been recorded for its nonce, users would need to fetch the off-chain anchored message corresponding to the update at the block at which it was flagged. The blockchain may charge periodic fees for state rent for these lists.
- Fully off-chain: in which case there will be some liveness assumptions around the issuer for checking if an attestation has been revoked/updated.

> "Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today." - [The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html)

We don't need oracles, tokens, automatic on-chain settlement & markets through smart contracts to build reputation systems for predictions & promises - all we need is to immutably sequence predictive messages that are authentically linked to identity and plot the results - the open nature of the data would disincentivize platforms to display it incorrectly which is enough - we trust block explorers after all.

Take the [Tipranks](https://www.tipranks.com/) platform as an example - we can generalize it for anyone in the world - not just for certified financial advisors. The reality is that millions of people are effectively guilty of shilling, despite some preficing it with the infamous [`"this is not financial advice"`](https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1552968186605490176). We can self-regulate the crypto & financial industries bottom-up in a decentralized way - steps:
1. come up with the base set of extensible prediction message types
2. build the tools that plot predictions versus a price feed
3. demand that influencers use the specific types of messages for predictions
4. refuse to listen to accounts that don't use that format and build the habit to check track records before listening to someone - this can (and will) become a social norm
5. let the [chips fall where they may](https://twitter.com/TSLAgang/status/1433896307702353921)

Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have "fallback" translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don't support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema `42` can have the following template for serialization: `"{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}"`, and thus a basic application that encounters `{message_type: "42", asset: "$BTC", date: "2025.02.12", above_or_below: "above", price: "100000$", probability: "80%"}` could render `"$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12"`. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there's no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.

The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.

<!-- Perhaps the reputation system can be abused - by making 100 accounts and building different prediction timelines throughout time and then using only the winners - this page should be treated just as a starting point and isn't trying to provide all the answers. -->

> "Finally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust. Self-authenticated data can retain metadata, like who published something and whether it was changed. Reputation and trust-graphs can be constructed on top of users, content, and services. The transparency provided by [verifiable computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing) provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced. We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products." - [bluesky](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

In science ideas (papers) rise in popularity with their citations. But what if someone wants to credit an idea without necessarily having to write a paper to reference it?

What if instead of the publish or perish paradigm for producing science we evaluated ideas in terms of their importance and not simply how many papers there are - actually we should reduce the ratio of papers to significant contributions

> "Do you want a revolution in science? Do what businesspeople do when they want a technological revolution: Just change the rules a bit. Let in a few revolutionaries. Make the hierarchy a bit flatter, to give the young people more scope and freedom. Create some opportunities for high-risk/high-payoff people, so as to balance the huge investment you made in low-risk, incremental science. The technology companies and investment banks use this strategy. Why not try it in academia? The payoff could be discovering how the universe works." - [Lee Smolin](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8753353-do-you-want-a-revolution-in-science-do-what-businesspeople)


> "When an important new theory is published, instead of being circulated and torn apart by the two dozen people whose opinions matter, it’s sent off to some nameless apparatchik for the hollow bureaucratic ritual of peer review, so that the reviewer can demand bogus citations for himself and his friends. Every field has some real scientists doing excellent work. But twenty-nine thirtieths of their peers are cargo cultists, outright fraudsters, or at best just aren’t all that great at their jobs." - [The DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit, by Ben Landau-Taylor](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/the-ddos-attack-of-academic-bullshit#:~:text=When%20an%20important,at%20their%20jobs.)

This is when an attacker shuts down an internet server by sending a massive flood of bogus communication requests, overloading the machine’s bandwidth until it is unable to respond to legitimate requests. Academia’s minority of serious researchers are also flooded with a massive, hostile flood of bogus communication requests. If most of their ostensible peers can’t discover new knowledge, then how will they find peers to work with? If most publications aren’t worth the time it takes to read, then who will bother to read the minority that are actually good?

If the academics do not raise their standards—and it seems like the opposite is more likely—then over time the real work will move gradually, and then suddenly, into different channels that are able to filter out the noise. This process is already underway. Because the internet commentariat’s intellectual elite is more attentive to an argument’s substance than whether it observes the bureaucratic forms, these circles are much less vulnerable to getting DDoSed by floods of well-formatted bullshit, and are slowly picking up more and more of the jobs that academia is abdicating." - [The DDoS Attack Of Academic Bullshit, by Ben Landau-Taylor](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/the-ddos-attack-of-academic-bullshit#:~:text=The%20effect%20is,academia%20is%20abdicating.)



> "While Tessier-Lavigne was at least forced out, rather than enjoying total impunity like Lesné, this should not be mistaken for justice. Medical fraud at this scale is mass manslaughter. If you ripped medicine out of the hands of every man, woman, and child in Spain, that would be about as many people as suffer from Alzheimer’s disease worldwide, whose treatments—and perhaps someday a cure—were all delayed for the benefit of one man’s career. In a just world, the perpetrators would not simply bounce from one prestigious executive position to another. In a just world, the trials of Sylvain Lesné and Marc Tessier-Lavigne would be at least as widely publicized as that of Sam Bankman-Fried. If found guilty, they would be imprisoned for decades.
>
> Medical fraud may be the most evil form of academic fraud, but it is not the only one, or even the most common. More famous is the “replication crisis” in academic psychology, where since around 2010 it has become widely known that most studies in psychology fail to replicate—which is a polite way of saying that the research is mostly fraud, statistical massaging such as “p-hacking,” or simple bullshit. This has had surprisingly little effect, and the field has proceeded with barely even any cosmetic changes, even though all informed observers now know that it’s mostly fake." - [The Academic Culture of Fraud, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2024/08/02/the-academic-culture-of-fraud/)

> "If bureaucratized peer reviewers or even a paper’s own coauthors aren’t expected to pay enough attention to notice blatant fraud, if fraud is only revealed by third-party investigators when they choose to make a years-long personal crusade in the face of institutional headwinds, if those frauds which are uncovered don’t come to light until decades after the fact, then we can be confident that almost all of the frauds have gotten away with it. Why wouldn’t you report the splashy result that you promised the grantmakers? Why wouldn’t you accept the prestige and promotions and money? Would you be deterred by the fear that, in twenty years, there will maybe be some bad articles online but you keep your job while your colleagues rally around you?" - [The Academic Culture of Fraud, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2024/08/02/the-academic-culture-of-fraud/)

> "The SEC maintains a bounty program for whistleblowers, who are awarded between 10% and 30% of the fines the commission imposes as a result of their information, and regularly announces bounties in the tens of millions. Those caught are often sent to prison. Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentence of 25 years may arguably be too lenient for billions of dollars of theft and fraud, but that he is in jail at all gives the financiers a much firmer moral grounding than the Alzheimer’s disease researchers. This approach, of a professional society granted extraordinary privileges while also required to submit to Congressional oversight and to assist in self-policing, provides a much more functional model for oligarchic guilds which have been delegated core social functions.
>
> The U.S. financial system is hardly the greatest edifice of justice in the world. Yet, it demonstrates a basic level of self-policing, effort to uphold professional standards, and accountability to the rest of society. Academic institutions fall far short of these minimal standards. Known serial frauds are sheltered by their bosses and feted by their peers. The culture encourages this at every step of the way, starting with PhD candidates ordered to produce a positive result by any means necessary, continuing with coauthors and grantmakers who can’t be bothered to look at the data and check whether it makes any sense, all the way to department heads and famous bestsellers being widely cited even after they’ve been caught. Those who do not commit fraud themselves usually tolerate it in their peers. The minority who will not tolerate frauds usually weed themselves out quietly. I have lost count of how many friends of friends entered a PhD program, had an adviser who tacitly or explicitly demanded they commit fraud to get publishable results, and quit in disgust without raising a public stink. What that says about those who remain is not encouraging.
>
> Fraud is certainly not the only problem in academic science. Lesser crimes such as massaging data to create false positives and “HARKing” (hypothesizing after the results are known) are even more common. Plagiarism has increasingly become a scandal, most famously forcing the resignation of Claudine Gay from the presidency of Harvard University, the highest post in America’s entire academic system. And many fields are overrun by the publication of bullshit and word games, meaningless enough that classifying it as “true” or “false” is not even useful. Fraudulent data is the worst of these sins, responsible for the biggest pile of dead bodies, since the damage it does is hardest for other scholars to undo. Yet these are all symptoms of the same disease.
>
> With some honorable exceptions, most academics don’t care very much about the capital-T Truth. Oh, they’d prefer Truth to lies, if Truth only cost two dollars. But if the cost is at all serious, they won’t pay it. It is a fault in the institutions that academics must choose between wealth and prestige and career success on the one hand, and pursuit of Truth on the other. But it is a fault in the professor’s character that he would turn his back on Truth, for this. Our civilization created the universities and carved out their special privileges because we recognize that the unencumbered pursuit of Truth is among the noblest callings, and also among the most useful. These people have been given a sacred trust, and they have abandoned it in order to secure a comfortable position. You cannot advance human knowledge by throwing venal careerists and apparatchiks at the problem, no matter how many tons of paper you print. Knowledge comes, and always has come, from insane people on a spiritual quest for Truth, who will neglect worldly concerns in pursuit of the insatiable drive to know. Today’s academics are living in the ruins of a temple built by better men." - [The Academic Culture of Fraud, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2024/08/02/the-academic-culture-of-fraud/)

> "More likely, reform will come through circumvention from outside the academic system. There is no shortage of people who pursue the sacred quest for Truth. Increasingly, they are not pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge in peer-reviewed journals and university campuses, but in fringe niches of internet discourse.

Science is broken - how do you easily look up all the criticism of a paper? You have to scan all the references from other papers and try to deduce based on the title which ones try to improve the idea instead of simply referencing it?

aseem malhotra - statins overperscribed and how were the original studies carried out in terms of excluding those with side effects and what the actual efficacy really is

how inefficient is reading papers? aren't they bloated in some respects? couldn't we express ideas as linked graphs so that the "reader" (explorer) could choose which nodes to inspect - without having to go through paragraphs ot text because they can't easily navigate to the novel parts in the big wall of text

When studies don't replicate - that signal should tricke down to everything that references or depends upon them. Imagine reading a book about psychology without having a clue that 10 years later more than 40% of the studies referenced in it are considered bogus and couldn't be replicated. This is information integration.

academia resembles feudalism


The modern research community knows they aren’t producing the best science they could be. There’s lots of
publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often
happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like “I can’t believe people are too
dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias,
turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who
do replication experiments. It would be really simple and it would vastly increase scientific progress. I must just
be smarter than all existing scientists, since I’m able to think of this and they aren’t.”
And yeah. That would work for the Science God. He could just make a Science Decree that everyone has to use
the right statistics, and make another Science Decree that everyone must accord replications higher status.
But things that work from a god’s-eye view don’t work from within the system. No individual scientist has an
incentive to unilaterally switch to the new statistical technique for her own research, since it would make her
research less likely to produce earth-shattering results and since it would just confuse all the other scientists.
They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no
individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results,
since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-
breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do
so.

We should fuse science with social media - but a new and improved version of social media

How many more foundational studies that underpin our model of the world are completely wrong?

The demonization of saturated fat was started by scientists who were paid off about 50k$ - our entire modern food pyramid is influenced by that

Open source code is compiled, ran & verified by many independent actors - we should fix the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) in science and push towards more [reproducible research](https://www.coursera.org/learn/reproducible-research).

> "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments." - [source](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a)

Papers can be split into text, data, code & results with all of them referencable with stable URIs & cryptographically tied to identity, reputation & [open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review). There will always be an element of trust for the input data coming from the physical world but the digital part can be locally verifiable & [replicable](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1556579944754384897). Citations could become [function calls / imports](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1309497397236477952) so that we can trace the dependency graph in science and focus on re-testing the most important bits - we might [save a billion or two and avoid lost decades](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease). We then could easily change the data in one paper and see the ripple effects for everything that depends on it. Let's build the digital chain of custody for papers, science & facts.

> "The site is popular globally, used by millions of people—many of whom would otherwise not be able to finish their degrees, advise their patients, or use text mining algorithms to make new scientific discoveries. Sci-Hub has become the unacknowledged foundation that helps the whole enterprise of academia to function." - [A World Without Sci-Hub, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/09/24/a-world-without-sci-hub/)

> "Whatever happens to Sci-Hub or Elbakyan, the fact that such a site exists is something of a tragedy. Sci-Hub currently fills a niche that should never have existed. Like the black-market medicine purchased by people who cannot afford prescription drugs, its very being indicts the official system that created the conditions of its emergence.
>
> The cost of individually purchasing all the articles required to complete a typical literature review could easily amount to thousands of dollars. Beyond paying for the articles themselves, academics often have to pay steep fees to publish their research. Meanwhile, most peer reviewers and editors charged with assessing, correcting, and formatting papers do not receive compensation for their work." - [A World Without Sci-Hub, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/09/24/a-world-without-sci-hub/)

> "Few public figures, if any, draw the direct connection between the expensive barricades around scientific research and the conspicuous epistemic collapse of significant portions of the American political discourse. Even the champions of the academic publishing industry appear unable to formulate coherent defenses... In this case, “financing” the peer review process means not paying anyone to do the actual work of peer review. Likewise, the “extensive investments” in “innovative digital platforms” failed to produce a user experience superior to that made by Elbakyan when she was in her early twenties. As for ensuring the “quality and integrity” of science, this seems to mean operating journals with surprisingly high retraction rates and inconsistent reliability. A 2018 study found that the costly involvement of academic publishers made “no significant differences” to the quality of scientific papers... Whether intended or not, the impossibly high paywalls of academic publishers only serve to keep scientific information out of the population’s hands. What makes this even more discordant is that the people being prevented from accessing the information are often also the taxpayers who helped fund the research in the first place... What a system calls itself is not always a reliable indicator of its true function. In this case, the name of the “academic publishing industry” implies that it is supposed to be involved in the dissemination of scholarship. But the effective function of the academic publishing industry as it actually exists is to prevent the dissemination of scholarly work.
>
> Given the example of Sci-Hub, the easy logistics of internet publication, and the funding structure of academic research, it seems clear that in the absence of the academic publishing industry, scholarship would be more widely available, not less. If the academic publishing industry did not exist, scientists could still do their research—in fact, it would be easier to do so as more people would have access to scholarly literature. The peer-review process could still function normally—though there are good reasons to change that as well. And the resulting papers could simply be posted in a place where anyone could read them.
>
> When we explore the actual function of the academic publishing industry—restricting access to scholarly research—we see that these publishers have little in common with the companies that have opposed other filesharing sites. When several record companies sued Napster in 2001, they could make the legitimate case that the economic well-being of the musicians, producers, and all the people who were needed to distribute recorded music was at stake. No such parallel exists in the case of Sci-Hub. Scientists are not paid by the publishers. Peer reviewers are not paid by the publishers. Distribution itself, as proven by Sci-Hub and its more law-abiding brother arXiv, is cheap enough to be provided to the public for free. It’s not surprising, then, that polls reveal that scientists [overwhelmingly support](https://twitter.com/bookscout/status/725841182224449536) Sci-Hub.
>
> All of this makes clear that the academic publishing industry does not derive its power from the satisfaction of its customers. Aaron Swartz’s case was only made possible due to both the vast protections that academic publishing has convinced its political friends to establish and the government’s willingness to target individual threats to that system through the legal process. It’s unclear what exactly the political motivations for prosecutors might have been, but [one theory](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/why-did-the-justice-system-target-aaron-swartz-106848/) is that Aaron’s political activities advocating for an open internet made him a useful target in a period when the U.S. government was attempting to clamp down on 2010sera rogue digital activism and hacker culture.
>
> Like the clandestine networks that helped to promote and popularize prohibited ideas and research in earlier eras, Sci-Hub functions as an infrastructure for circumventing artificially imposed limits on human thought. Few people today are priced out of streaming films or buying MP3s, but access to scientific information has become a true luxury item.
>
> The rationale for restricting information may be different than in previous eras. For the academic publishers, it is about extracting rents rather than enforcing ideological or theological orthodoxy. But making scientific journals prohibitively expensive unfortunately achieves the same effect as censoring them. Indeed, it is a more clever strategy because it allows the publishers to defend themselves using the moral language of property rights. Perhaps the KGB would have enjoyed a better reputation if they had merely charged astronomical sums for copies of Solzhenitsyn.
>
> ... There are approximately zero people holding signs denouncing Sci-Hub and demanding greater acceptance of paywalls. Instead, the academic publishing lobby nurtures direct relationships with politicians, uses its influence to advise policies, and maintains well-funded legal teams that can use lawfare against opponents.
>
> ... In their letter to the Trump administration protesting the rumored executive order, the academic publishing industry wrote that moves to increase open access “would effectively nationalize the valuable American intellectual property that we produce and force us to give it away to the rest of the world for free.” To which a chorus of scientists and researchers says in unison: [Yes](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/it-time-nationalise-academic-publishers). Nationalization could not only address the problems of academic publishing and make scientific work and innovation based on it easier, it could also boost American soft power in an age of waning American geopolitical dominance." - [A World Without Sci-Hub, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/09/24/a-world-without-sci-hub/)



> "Science had an important flaw in its epistemic foundation, dating back to Boyle and the Royal Society—its failure to determine the proper conditions and use of scientific authority. “Nullius in verba” made some sense in 1660, before much science was settled and when the enterprise was small enough that most natural philosophers could personally observe or replicate the experiments of the others. It came to make less sense as science itself succeeded, scaled up, and acquired intellectual authority. Perhaps a better answer to the question of scientific authority would have led science to take a different course.
>
> Turning from the past to the future, we now face the worrying prospect that the union of science and the state may have weakened science itself. Some time ago, commentators raised the specter of scientific slowdown, and more recent analysis has provided further justification for these fears. Why is science slowing? To put it simply, it may be difficult to have science be both authoritative and exploratory at the same time.
>
> When scientists are meant to be authoritative, they’re supposed to know the answer. When they’re exploring, it’s okay if they don’t. Hence, encouraging scientists to reach authoritative conclusions prematurely may undermine their ability to explore—thereby yielding scientific slowdown. Such a dynamic may be difficult to detect, since the people who are supposed to detect it might themselves be wrapped up in a premature authoritative consensus.
>
> Thus, from an unfixed flaw in the foundation, the surprise accumulation of authority and premature acceptance of that authority, science completed the inversion of its original ethos—and nullius in verba became “trust the science.”
>
> ...
>
> The next phase of the evolution of science will necessarily involve the reconciliation of its exploratory and authoritative elements. This will require changes both at the level of scientific practice and public understanding.
>
> At the level of scientific practice, we should expect vast changes in institutions. Some scientific fields and subfields should continue to claim authority. Others, however, should disclaim it partly or completely. Some journals should continue to expect authoritatively written papers. Others should discourage authoritative writing, or even ban it. Many have fretted over the replication crisis and its solution—for fields below a certain level of replication, we might consider decertification.
>
> Sweeping proposals are like a bludgeon; a masterful restructuring of science would operate like a scalpel. In some cases, the best solution might be to break a field into multiple separate and rarely interacting components, thereby preventing premature consensus. In other cases, it may be necessary to introduce many different gradations of acceptance and authority.
>
> The funding landscape may also need to be restructured, with funding for the exploratory parts of science becoming much more decentralized. Career tracks might be distinguished into types depending on the solidity of the scientific field—quite naturally, different people will succeed in later-stage sciences than in earlier-stage ones.
>
> The use of scientific authority in public will have to more thoroughly integrate certain truths that every practicing scientist knows and takes for granted. These include that some parts of science are settled and others far from it, that different fields have different degrees of solidity, and that different results carry different degrees of authority.
>
> Together, these changes would amount to an important change in the nature of science, both epistemically and as a public institution. Nullius in verba would be set to one side, “trust the science” would be set to the other. Between them, taking each in correct measure, we may find a new and better middle way. Previous transformations of science have taken centuries; with effort and care, this one may go faster." - [The Transformations of Science, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/10/the-transformations-of-science/)



TODO: bringing real-world data on-chain

If we onboard the worlds information and build reputation systems, we will have solved the oracle problem of bringing facts & events to the blockchain. Example: the result of a ufc fight - no longer need an oracle as ufc itself will post the result in an unambiguous way
