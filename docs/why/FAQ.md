> "Good ideology. Wrong species." - [E. O. Wilson on Marxism](https://paulgraham.com/quo.html#:~:text=%22Good%20ideology.%20Wrong%20species.%22%0A%0A%E2%80%93%20E.%20O.%20Wilson%20on%20Marxism)

Do you expect a properly summarized account of communism's failures and a thorough comparison with it in a FAQ? Just pick up the book Nordic Ideology and look at appendix A.


No. And yes. And no. And yes. What kind of a question is that? It's also capitalistic and libertarian and so on. It’s time for you to upgrade your capacity for complex thinking and not just let others define the boxes you should put ideas in so easily. What's proposed here is at least an order of magnitude more complex than either communism or capitalism - something entirely new.

Communism ignored human nature - this embraces it. This is infinitely more sophisticated than communism and is thus nothing like it - it is as far from laizees-fare capitalism as it is from communism - this is its own thing - something entirely novel.

or maybe scrap all of this - appendix A of the book Nordic Ideology gives a much better account of communism and its failures than u could ever come up with. focusing on human nature only is simplistic - you can't give a thorough answer here without including most (all?) of what's in that book.

## Why so dense?

Because sparseness and vagueness is a disrespect to the finitude of life and attention of others
And this material is comprehensible by a tiny fraction of people anyway

This is not meant for the average reader - few will be able to plow through it with ease and fully grasp what it entails.

## This is all BS

> "If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry." - [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10722205-if-you-don-t-believe-me-or-don-t-get-it-i)

## I vehemently disagree or don't understand 10-20% of the content here

Good! that means you're on board with the other 80-90% and we can focus on either fixing the other 10-20% or helping you fill the gaps to get you further.

## This can't possibly work! How will X work?

Will this work? No clue. But what we can say with 100% confidence that we must try to create a better system than the current one.


> "A vision should be judged by the clarity of its values, not the clarity of its implementation path." - [Donella H. Meadows](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/163481-a-vision-should-be-judged-by-the-clarity-of-its)



> "Normally, when you challenge the conventional wisdom—that the current economic and political system is the only possible one—the first reaction you are likely to get is a demand for a detailed architectural blueprint of how an alternative system would work, down to the nature of its financial instruments, energy supplies, and policies of sewer maintenance. Next, you are likely to be asked for a detailed program of how this system will be brought into existence. Historically, this is ridiculous. When has social change ever happened according to someone’s blueprint? It’s not as if a small circle of visionaries in Renaissance Florence conceived of something they called “capitalism,” figured out the details of how the stock exchange and factories would someday work, and then put in place a program to bring their visions into reality. In fact, the idea is so absurd we might well ask ourselves how it ever occurred to us to imagine this is how change happens to begin." - [David Graeber](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/776644-normally-when-you-challenge-the-conventional-wisdom-that-the-current-economic)


## TL;DR?

The later you read this the more of a laggard you will be - this system is inevitable

## Why are so many quotes here not real?

Because we have a broken digital system for attributing who said and expressed what. How about we change that?

## Won't the powers that be oppose this system?
