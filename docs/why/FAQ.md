> "Good ideology. Wrong species." - [E. O. Wilson on Marxism](https://paulgraham.com/quo.html#:~:text=%22Good%20ideology.%20Wrong%20species.%22%0A%0A%E2%80%93%20E.%20O.%20Wilson%20on%20Marxism)



No. And yes. And no. And yes. What kind of a question is that? It's also capitalistic and libertarian and so on. Itâ€™s time for you to upgrade your capacity for complex thinking and not just let others define the boxes you should put ideas in so easily. What's proposed here is at least an order of magnitude more complex than either communism or capitalism - something entirely new.

Communism ignored human nature - this embraces it. This is infinitely more sophisticated than communism and is thus nothing like it - it is as far from laizees-fare capitalism as it is from communism - this is its own thing - something entirely novel.




## Will this work?

No clue. But what we can say with 100% confidence that we must try to create a better system than the current one.
