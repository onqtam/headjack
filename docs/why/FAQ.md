# FAQ

## Is this a real FAQ?

No. These questions haven't been asked by anybody (yet). It's a mix of what we want to say about this book and also some questions that we anticipate will be quite frequent.

## Is this a revolution?

Yes, but a peaceful one - entirely opt-in.

## Is this a religion?

Yes

## Is this utopia?

Its even better: it can actually work

## Is this communism?

> "The worst idea in economic discourse is that political economy is a sliding scale between capitalism and communism. That's just some random international conflict that got baked into the rhetoric for ideological reasons." - [Ben Landau-Taylor](https://x.com/benlandautaylor/status/1858552169089434081)

Do you expect a properly summarized account of communism's failures and a thorough comparison with it in a FAQ? Just pick up the book Nordic Ideology and look at appendix A.


No. And yes. And no. And yes. What kind of a question is that? It's also capitalistic and libertarian and so on. It’s time for you to upgrade your capacity for complex thinking and not just let others define the boxes you should put ideas in so easily. What's proposed here is at least an order of magnitude more complex than either communism or capitalism - something entirely new.

Communism ignored human nature - this embraces it. This is infinitely more sophisticated than communism and is thus nothing like it - it is as far from laizees-fare capitalism as it is from communism - this is its own thing - something entirely novel.

or maybe scrap all of this - appendix A of the book Nordic Ideology gives a much better account of communism and its failures than u could ever come up with. focusing on human nature only is simplistic - you can't give a thorough answer here without including most (all?) of what's in that book.

If you call this communism, the devout communists from the past century will be rolling in their graves screaming in agony - have mercy on their souls. This is NOTHING like communism or capitalism or any other ism that has ever existed. This is it's own new thing and is more complex than the combination of everything that's come before it.

## Why so dense?

Because sparseness and vagueness is a disrespect to the finitude of life and attention of others
And this material is comprehensible by a tiny fraction of people anyway

This is not meant for the average reader - few will be able to plow through it with ease and fully grasp what it entails.

## This is all BS
## This is too long - how do you expect anyone to read it? TL;DR? @grok is this true? / summarize plz

## I vehemently disagree or don't understand 10-20% of the content here

Good! that means you're on board with the other 80-90% and we can focus on either fixing the other 10-20% or helping you fill the gaps to get you further.

## Why a book? Why didn't you simply implement it?

put the response to Joscha here

## Why is there so little aboit AI?

Because there's nothing we could add to the discussion. We stay in our lane of competence. The most intelligent thing we can say is that anyone speaking with high confidence about what's going to happen with AI should not be taken too seriously.

What we can do, however, is help shift the conversation more towards an architecture for collective intelligence. We're interested in a system to better make sense of situations such as the one we find ourselves in regards to AI. We're interested in the meta solution for social organization.

## This can't possibly work! How will X work?

Will this work? No clue. But what we can say with 100% confidence that we must try to create a better system than the current one.


> "A vision should be judged by the clarity of its values, not the clarity of its implementation path." - [Donella H. Meadows](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/163481-a-vision-should-be-judged-by-the-clarity-of-its)



> "Normally, when you challenge the conventional wisdom—that the current economic and political system is the only possible one—the first reaction you are likely to get is a demand for a detailed architectural blueprint of how an alternative system would work, down to the nature of its financial instruments, energy supplies, and policies of sewer maintenance. Next, you are likely to be asked for a detailed program of how this system will be brought into existence. Historically, this is ridiculous. When has social change ever happened according to someone’s blueprint? It’s not as if a small circle of visionaries in Renaissance Florence conceived of something they called “capitalism,” figured out the details of how the stock exchange and factories would someday work, and then put in place a program to bring their visions into reality. In fact, the idea is so absurd we might well ask ourselves how it ever occurred to us to imagine this is how change happens to begin." - [David Graeber](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/776644-normally-when-you-challenge-the-conventional-wisdom-that-the-current-economic)


## I don't agree with X or even 100 Xs

Good thing there are more than a thousand ideas here - you can support what you like and debate with others everything else

## How much AI was used in the creatin of this book?

0 - there's no substituting of processing and judgement. Even summaries before deciding if something is worth reading aren't worth it.

## TL;DR?

The later you read this the more of a laggard you will be - this system is inevitable

> "I am sorry to have made such a long speech, but I did not have time to write a shorter one." - [Winston Churchill](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/788641)

## Why are so many quotes here not real?

Because we have a broken digital system for attributing who said and expressed what. How about we change that?

## Won't the powers that be oppose this system?

This is for those that can read between the lines


## isnt social credit distopic?

Response: isn’t money equally wtf? Imagine there was no money and someone pitched u that u might die because u cant afford a hospital - TODO work on this - this was just a stoner line
