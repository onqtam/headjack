# How to read this book

This book presents itself to you as a fractal - nested levels of detail depending on your interests

make a diagram with all the titles and how some of them connect to different aspects of the last chapter "as a service"

This is going to provoke you. Feel free to stop reading the moment you see some actual inconsistency or something very illogical, but unless you encounter such a thing, keep reading. We will deliver on every single one of these titles - no exception. By the time you're done with the book you'll agree with all of them too.

We defend very few of the arguments we make - instead we count on the intuition of the reader to see that they are mostly right. And in the case of disagreement - the hope is that there is enough enticing material for readers to stick around, and to then help resolve some of the issues of the text in the system we shall build.

# about the quote-heavy style of the book

Could a lot of the quotes have been paraphrased and made shorter and clearer? Yes. But this is a philosophical statement: we must reuse and interlink and credit the work of others as much as possible.

Faq: why so many quotes? Multiple reasons:
1) unique style
2) an example how this complex set of expressions could have been aggregated from so many sources
the contribution should be in what's new instead of rehashing other people's ideas and taking credit
The quote-heavy part of this book is mostly an effort in selection and taste, a collector's edition for impactful thought by others.
The contribution of this book is in 1) this selection with zero paraphrasing and full accounting of credit, and 2) the novel ideas that build on top of everything that's quoted.

However, in may of the quotes the references to the ends of the papers were omitted for brevity. Not sure if this was the right choice but it's too late now anyway.

All books have some repetition of what is being said, but it's usually by the same author and with very similar words. When using so many quotes by others, many points get made more than once, but with the distinct vocabularies and approaches of the many different authors.

You get to experience a wide plethora of styles.

We're not good writers, but we're good curators - we have good judgement and taste, and thus we offer this compilation of thought from many authors with as little paraphrasing as possible.

Pansophy
    > "... pansophy, a system of universal wisdom that could serve as an integrative world philosophy. The notion of pansophy itself can be found in several Rosicrucian texts, where it represents a sophisticated Neoplatonic synthesis of alchemy, Christology, Utopianism, and Baconian natural science... Comenius’ pansophic work presents a theory of everything woven together right as modernity began to fracture the value spheres and disciplines. It is an attempt at an integration of all knowledge into a single system, including the new empirical sciences, as well as religious aspects of human culture. Importantly, pansophy provides for the design of educational configurations capable of catalyzing a universal reform of all human institutions." - [Education must make History Again, by Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)

The Liminal
    > "The liminal is exactly that which is the bridge and fulcrum between worlds. The focus of work in the liminal is on foundations, metaphysics, religion, and the deeper codes and sources of culture—education in its broadest sense. Individuals working here are often “beyond [conventional notion of] good and evil” in the Nietzschean sense, having stepped out past the edges of the old world, while doing the work of creating a new one. This is dangerous work and the stakes are high, as the choices and actions made in the liminal set the trajectory and shape of the new emerging world." - [Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)
