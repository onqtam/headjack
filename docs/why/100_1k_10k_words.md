# How to read this book

## The Fractal Nature of This Book

This book presents itself to you as a fractal - nested levels of detail depending on your interests and time.
    Even putting parts of quotes in bold helps to guide one's attention to the most important bits first, but then you get curious why the other parts were not put in bold and you read them you'll realize they're just as important.

## why so dense

get stuff from the FAQ
feel free to skip sections such as `Challenge Propagation & Offer Networks` if that's not your thing.

## why so many quotes


make a diagram with all the titles and how some of them connect to different aspects of the last chapter "as a service"

> "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the *~~Matrix~~* **WHATEVER THIS THING IS** is. You have to *~~see~~* **read** it for yourself." - [Morpheus, The Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/quotes/?item=qt0324246&ref_=ext_shr_lnk), probably

This is going to provoke you. Feel free to stop reading the moment you see some actual inconsistency or something very illogical, but unless you encounter such a thing, keep reading. We will deliver on every single one of these titles - no exception. By the time you're done with the book you'll agree with all of them too.

Reading them before reading the book will give you some idea of what you're about to download into your head but not all will make sense. However, by the time you're done with the book you'll understand all of them and many of them will probably deeply resonate with you. It's probably best to read them twice: once before the book and once after.

We defend very few of the arguments we make - instead we count on the intuition of the reader to see that they are mostly right. And in the case of disagreement - the hope is that there is enough enticing material for readers to stick around, and to then help resolve some of the issues of the text in the system we shall build.

On your first reading you may skip all optional parts that are in expandable sections, and you can dive deeper later on if you feel like it. `Expandable section == optional`.

This is a very dense book, but understanding it and the system it would produce is a heck of a lot easier than understanding the current disordered system we find ourselves in.


"After this," says Morpheus to Neo in The Matrix, "there is no turning back."
You take the blue pill — the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill — you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

What ull experience during reading this book
The six stages of comprehension

# about the quote-heavy style of the book

Collector’s Edition

Could a lot of the quotes have been paraphrased and made shorter and clearer? Yes. But this is a philosophical statement: we must reuse and interlink and credit the work of others as much as possible.

Faq: why so many quotes? Multiple reasons:
1) unique style
2) an example how this complex set of expressions could have been aggregated from so many sources
the contribution should be in what's new instead of rehashing other people's ideas and taking credit
The quote-heavy part of this book is mostly an effort in selection and taste, a collector's edition for impactful thought by others.
The contribution of this book is in 1) this selection with zero paraphrasing and full accounting of credit, and 2) the novel ideas that build on top of everything that's quoted.

However, in may of the quotes the references to the ends of the papers were omitted for brevity. Not sure if this was the right choice but it's too late now anyway.

All books have some repetition of what is being said, but it's usually by the same author and with very similar words. When using so many quotes by others, many points get made more than once, but with the distinct vocabularies and approaches of the many different authors.

You get to experience a wide plethora of styles.

We aim to say as much as possible using as few words of our own as possible.

We're not good writers, but we're good curators - we have good judgement and taste (and relevance realization), and thus we offer this compilation of thought from many authors with as little paraphrasing as possible.



Also, every fact, opinion, argument & subargument, relation & expression that's in this book will eventually be encoded as structured data in the giant global graph of the global brain, from which we'd be able to generate a textual (or multimodal) representation on any level of abstraction with the help of AI in a back-and-forth conversational manner. Why bother with trying to rewrite the words of others for some marginal benefit of brevity at this point in time if it'll eventually be obsolete? In the future everything that's in this book will be seen at best as a first draft of an architectural synthesis for the self-organization of our species obsolete both in the arguments (with the exception of whatever essence passes the gauntlet of selection) and in the form of expresion (text). This exact text should not and will not be read by anyone in 100 or 1000 years - it will have morphed into whatever its successor is. The seed no longer exists by the time it's grown into a tree. Text is dead - it's just not evenly distributed. This book will dissolve/(meta)morph into the symbolic subtrate that it will give birth to.

# The First Book With Multiple Titles

> "The *~~Tao~~* **book** that can be *~~told~~* **named** is not the eternal *~~Tao~~* **book**." - [Lao Tzu](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/230935-the-tao-that-can-be-told-is-not-the-eternal), probably

The third attractor is the official name, but the most liked name by the authors is one of these 100

Reading these before the book will help get a sense of what's to come, but they'll resonate a lot more after reading the book so feel free to revisit them.

Because why not. Seriously!

The Gateway Insight
    > "None of our current socio-politico-economic operating system was brought down from Mt Sinai by Moses. We built it, we can change it. We own the moral responsibility for the nature of our society." - [Jim Rutt](https://x.com/jim_rutt/status/1783469872569082063)
    > "The thing I would say is, when you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is, and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But life, that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use. And the minute that you understand that you can poke life, and actually something will, you know, if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it. You can mold it. That's maybe the most important thing is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it, versus embrace it. Change it. Improve it. Make your mark upon it. I think that's very important. And however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better. Because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again." - [Steve Jobs: Secrets of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw)

    <details><summary>Quote by Daniel Schmachtenberger on Ubuntu</summary><p>
    > "The idea of [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy), I am because we are, It was this foundational concept of human beings before the thing we call civilization, right? I Am Because We Are was, like, just at the most prosaic level, nature did not select for individual sapiens. It only selected for groups of sapiens. Individual sapiens in evolutionary environments were all dead. And so what's best for me that fucks the tribe is not a concept. That's not a thing, right? What is best for the tribe that I can't exist without of? I am because we are, I would not exist. I'd be dead without all of us. That's like the basic insight. So I am, because we are obviously just starts with, I couldn't survive without us. But then it's also deeper, which is I think in words that I didn't invent that all these other people invented. And, but my own most intimate thing, my thoughts with myself are in a language that I didn't make. I am... my thoughts were made by other people, right? The... language of my thoughts, my understanding of the world was transmitted to me largely by other people. The tools that I use, the things that I benefit from, the, all of that, that I am, almost all the things I think of as I am, because we are, right? Because of things that were created. And it goes deeper, because the we was never, never just meant our tribe. It also meant nature. The extension to all our relationships, and all our relationships was all life, and life didn't just mean biological, which is why they were animistic. Those cultures were all animistic. The spirit of the sun, the spirit of the river, the spirit of everything, because it was a very clear understanding. What would I be without the tribe? I'd be dead. What would I be without the sun? I would have never existed. What would I be without the galactic center around which the sun orbits? I wouldn't exist. What would I be without the gravitational field? What would I be without the soil microbes? What would I be without plants? What would I be without all of that? I wouldn't be. So, I, that is not the emergent property of we, isn't even a thing. It's not even thinking." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/tmusbHBKW84?t=6699)

    > "... pansophy, a system of universal wisdom that could serve as an integrative world philosophy. The notion of pansophy itself can be found in several Rosicrucian texts, where it represents a sophisticated Neoplatonic synthesis of alchemy, Christology, Utopianism, and Baconian natural science... Comenius’ pansophic work presents a theory of everything woven together right as modernity began to fracture the value spheres and disciplines. It is an attempt at an integration of all knowledge into a single system, including the new empirical sciences, as well as religious aspects of human culture. Importantly, pansophy provides for the design of educational configurations capable of catalyzing a universal reform of all human institutions." - [Education must make History Again, by Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)
