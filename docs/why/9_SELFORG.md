Complex systems science teaches us that local, bottom-up and distributed coordination are typically the most effective and capable mechanisms for enabling emergent global order in highly complex environments. This is because, in complex systems, there are simply too many differentiated parts for effective top-down mechanisms for coordination to stably function and synergize the whole. Thus any global systems science and serious sociopolitical global development agenda must understand how to maintain a new planetary organization with dynamic and distributed mechanisms that lead to self-organization (as opposed to static and hierarchical historical mechanisms that produce centralized organization)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Although the market is a highly chaotic, non-linear system, it usually reaches an approximate equilibrium in which the many changing and conflicting demands of consumers are all satisfied. The failure of communism has shown that the market is much more effective at organizing the economy than a centrally controlled system. It is as if a mysterious power ensures that goods are produced in the right amounts and distributed to the right places. What Adam Smith, the father of economics, called "the invisible hand" can nowadays simply be called self-organization." - [The science of self-organization and adaptivity, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf)

> "Although centralized control does have some advantages over distributed control (e.g. it allows more autonomy and stronger specialization for the controller), at some level it must itself be based on distributed control. For example, the behavior of our body can be best explained by studying what happens in our brain, since the brain, through the nervous system, controls the movement of our muscles. However, to explain the functioning of our brain, we can no longer rely on some “mind within the mind” that tells the different brain neurons what to do. This is the traditional philosophical problem of the homunculus, the hypothetical “little man” that had to be postulated as the one that makes all the decisions within our mental system. Any explanation for organization that relies on some separate control, plan or blueprint must also explain where that control comes from, otherwise it is not really an explanation. The only way to avoid falling into the trap of an infinite regress (the mind within the mind within the mind within...) is to uncover a mechanism of self- organization at some level.
>
> The brain illustrates this principle nicely. Its organization is distributed over a network of interacting neurons. Although different brain regions are specialized for different tasks, no neuron or group of neurons has overall control. This is shown by the fact that minor brain lesions because of accidents, surgery or tumors normally do not disturb overall functioning, whatever the region that is destroyed." - [The science of self-organization and adaptivity, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf)

> "Feedback can have two basic values: positive or negative. Feedback is said to be positive if the recurrent influence reinforces or amplifies the initial change. In other words, if a change takes place in a particular direction, the reaction being fed back takes place in that same direction. Feedback is negative if the reaction is opposite to the initial action, that is, if change is suppressed or counteracted, rather than reinforced. Negative feedback stabilizes the system, by bringing deviations back to their original state. Positive feedback, on the other hand, makes deviations grow in a runaway, explosive manner. It leads to accelerated development, resulting in a radically different configuration." - [The science of self-organization and adaptivity, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf)

> "Cybernetics has shown that adaptation can be modelled as a problem of regulation or control: minimizing deviations from a goal configuration by counteracting perturbations before they become large enough to endanger the essential organization. This means that the system must be able to: 1) produce a sufficient variety of actions to cope with each of the possible perturbations (Ashby’s “law of requisite variety”); 2) select the most adequate counteraction for a given perturbation." - [The science of self-organization and adaptivity, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf)

> "The system needs a fitness criterion for choosing the best action for the given circumstances. The most straightforward method is to let the environment itself determine what is fit: if the action maintains the basic organization, it is, otherwise it is not. This can be dangerous, though, since trying out an inadequate action may lead to the destruction of the system. Therefore, complex systems such as organisms or minds have evolved internal models of the environment. This allows them to try out a potential action “virtually”, in the model, and use the model to decide on its fitness. The model functions as a vicarious selector, which internally selects actions acting for, or in anticipation of, external selection. This “shortcut” makes the selection of actions much more reliable and efficient. It must be noted, though, that these models themselves at some stage must have evolved to fit the real environment; otherwise they cannot offer any reliable guidance." - [The science of self-organization and adaptivity, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/EOLSS-Self-Organiz.pdf)

Bureaucracies are described as networks of agents, where the main design principle is to reduce local “friction” to increase local and global “satisfaction”. Following this principle, solutions are proposed for improving communication within bureaucracies, sensing public satisfaction, dynamic modification of hierarchies, and contextualization of procedures. Each of these reduces friction between agents (internal or external), increasing the efficiency of bureaucracies." - [Towards Self-organizing Bureaucracies, by Carlos Gershenson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0603045.pdf)

They have social goals and responsibilities that are achieved by a division of labor that is usually hierarchical. Examples of bureaucracies can be seen with tax collection systems, immigration services, and steering of educational and academic institutions. The efficiency of a bureaucracy is related to the fulfillment of its goals. Thus, it would be desirable to increase functional efficiency in bureaucracies.

> "You face a problem - in fact it's a meta problem whenever you're trying to do any problem solving - this is the following problem: the amount of information available to you is combinatorily explosive, it is vast, it is overwhelming. The amount of things you could pay attention to in this room - you could look at that spot right there, or that spot, or the relationship between the spots - you can do that, you're capable of it. When you think about it carefully now: the amount of ways you could look at this room and attend to it is combinatorially explosive. It is vast. The amount of information you have in your long-term memory and the possible combinations - it's huge. You could think of an aardvark, you could think of the Aztec empire, you could think of the beginning of the gold standard, and you could possibly even connect them all together. Think of all the ways you can connect all the things in your long-term memory. All the sequences of actions - I'm going to solve a problem - I'm going to start moving my body around, I can move this finger, then this finger could move these two, I could grab I could lift my hands, like oh I can sing - out of all the possible combinations you somehow zero in on the right thing to do, the right thing to pay attention to, and the right things to be remembering right now. You zero in on the relevant information and you ignore most - overwhelmingly most - of the irrelevant information. You frame your cognition and you pay attention only to what's within that frame and you ignore what's outside of that frame. It sounds paradoxical but this is the case - you're intelligent because of your capacity to ignore so much information." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=730)

> "Relevance realization is the name I give to a process which I argue is central to general intelligence. Your general intelligence is your capacity to solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains. For most of the problems you face the interrelated tasks of selecting what you are to pay attention to, what you are going to remember, and what you are going to do. The problem facing attention is that the amount of information available to you is astronomically vast. You have to ignore most of it, which is a lot of information. You cannot just arbitrarily guess what you should attend to nor can you methodically check all the information for that would take more time than your lifetime. There is a similar problem facing memory. Your long term memory stores a vast amount of knowledge, and the number of ways that information can be combined is astronomically vast. Similarly, all the possible sequences of actions which you could undertake is astronomically vast. Yet, moment by moment you are neither guessing nor methodically checking all the information, all your memory, or all the options for action. You are homing in on the relevant information while remembering the information relevant to your situation and selecting a relevant course of action. What is so impressive is how this is all obvious to you, and it is very often relevant to the context you are in and to the problem at hand. You can rely on the obviousness of your experience and that it is reliably sensitive to context. However, cognitive science has to explain how you generate such obviousness such that it is contextually sensitive to solving your problems. Saying that relevance is obvious or depends on context does not solve the problem because this merely renames the problem of relevance realization as the problem of generating a sense of the relevance of information in a contextually sensitive manner, and how do we do that? To say we learn it by experience is not helpful because to say we learn is to say that we zero in on relevant information in order to solve our problems. This learning cannot be arbitrary association nor can it use exhaustive examination of situations. Learning presupposes relevance realization and therefore cannot explain it. I currently have a paper under review, where my coauthors and I argue that relevance realization is probably convergent with the precision weighting at the core of predictive processing models. This convergence adds significant theoretical plausibility to the proposal that relevance realization is central to intelligence." - [John Vervaeke](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-summary-of-relevance-realization-according-to-John-Vervaeke)

> "Somehow problem solvers reliably (but not perfectly) zero in on the relevant information to be investigated. They do not do this abstractly, but in the way they formulate the problem. How individuals represent the initial state, goal state, operations, and path constraints, is the way in which they attempt to zero in on relevant information. Problem formulation is how problem solvers constrain the search space of a particular problem so that heuristics can effectively apply to it. Problem formulation captures what problem solvers deem relevant to a specific problem, and this formulation helps them to intelligently ignore most of the information in the search space. To intelligently ignore means that problem solvers do not even consider most available information, and they find and focus upon information that turns out to be relevant without comparing it to all the irrelevant information that is available." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Consider how we are beset by ill-defined problems all day long such as following and/or joining a conversation successfully, getting and/or telling a joke or telling a story. As such, we frequently have to generate problem formulations in order to both address ill-definedness and to avoid combinatorial explosion. Not only do we have to zero in on relevant information, we often have to generate missing relevant information in order to do so. Problem formulation handles both of these demands and is a primary way in which we do relevance realization within problem solving.
>
> However, sometimes the problem formulation constrains a problem in such a way so that it cannot be solved; the problem formulation itself becomes problematic. In these circumstances, the problem formulations need to be broken up and reformulated. The solver must have an insight: their relevance realization abilities have to be flexibly recursive and self-correcting. They have to realize that they have misformulated the problem and be capable of generating a new relevance profile that then informs a new, more effective formulation." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "We never represent all the properties of anything because we are in the finitary predicament. We always only represent a subset of any real world things. This subset of features and how they hang together is an aspect. All representation is aspectual. Yet an aspect is a zeroing in on properties deemed relevant, and a formulation of those properties as highly relevant to each other and to oneself and others. The ability to represent crucially presupposes the ability to realize relevance and therefore cannot serve as a basis of explaining it without circularity." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Relevance realization must be happening at a level of analysis more basic than standard information processing. Yet it cannot be handled by some central processor because that processor would face a combinatorial explosion of information facing it even within the brain’s own processing. The processing of relevance realization has to happen as a constraint on all processing both local and global within the brain. Relevance realization has to be internal, sub-semantic, sub-syntactic, and scale invariant in its operations. Finally, it must be completely self-organizing because it has to be a self-correcting and self-transforming process." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "McKee and Barber note that it is not just any kind of insight that constitutes wisdom. Rather it is some kind of insight through illusion and into reality. Meeks and Jeste indicate that the insight involved in wisdom also has importantly to do with self‐reflection/self‐understanding.

> "This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions. Taken together, combinatorial complexity in problem solving, the largely ill-defined nature of most problems and the consideration of consequences serve to indicate the centrality of our relevance realization machinery. Thus, relevance realization is central; it involves the ability to frame our cognition and, most importantly, to do this flexibly, i.e. to be able to reframe.
