# Centralization of DNS & certificate authorities
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "The Domain Name Server (DNS) is the Achilles heel of the Web." - [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/tim_bernerslee_373104)

<!-- https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1604153242505584640 -->

ledger of record page - this can obsolete certificate authorities in the use of TLS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure
Public key infrastructure is inherently centralized

https://theinternetprotocolblog.wordpress.com/2023/02/12/reflections-on-certificates-part-2/



> "According to Netcraft in May 2015, the industry standard for monitoring active TLS certificates, "Although the global [TLS] ecosystem is competitive, it is dominated by a handful of major CAs — three certificate authorities (Symantec, Comodo, GoDaddy) account for three-quarters of all issued [TLS] certificates on public-facing web servers." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)

The internet is decentralized as much as its weakest links which are DNS & certificate authorities

By July 2022 just 3 certificate authorities (IdenTrust, DigiCert & Sectigo) are responsible for [3 quarters of the entire market](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/ssl_certificate).

Certificate authorities should be a thing of the past.

Furthermore, content served by a website through HTTPS (so using SSL) cannot be cached & cryptographically frozen in time because if the certificate is revoked then there's no way to actually prove the order of events - when was the data signed (cannot rely on internal timestamps) and until when was the certificate valid. Headjack fixes this by anchoring all off-chain events with a merkle proof on-chain & sequences what's relevant.

> "In a separate disclosure unrelated to Snowden, the French Trésor public, which runs a certificate authority, was found to have issued fake certificates impersonating Google in order to facilitate spying on French government employees via man-in-the-middle attacks." - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present))

yet more CENTRALIZATION in checking for the validity of certificates:
reliance on OCSP which is vulnerable to DDoS, replay attacks 
turtles all the way down - CAs delegate other entities to be OCSP responders
Also if a MITM attack is possible then 
If an attacker has compromised the private key of a server and is doing a MITM attack then OCSP requests will also be going through them - rendering OCSP an unreliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.
> "Because most clients will silently ignore OCSP if the query times out, OCSP is not a reliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol#Criticisms)

OCSP also leaks browsing behavior

> "The recommendation algorithms & the social graph are the architecture of virality - the dynamics of amplification & interaction dictate how ideas surface, propagate, compound & evolve. The people writing the algorithmic feeds are the most powerful in the world." - [@naval](https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3616).

Ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions & results leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as [Dr. Robert Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies) would [attest](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4q0cNkAHQQMBTu4NmeNW7E) - there is 0 accountability.

> "Google gets much of its revenue from connecting user inputs to ads, and the product is squeezing the content. Google has not only lost its direction, it has forgotten its purpose." - [Joscha Bach](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1724714156019110397)

Does such a search engine exist today? Competition & a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.

> "The search button on the browser no longer provides an objective search, but a commercial one." - [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1389809)

The explicit user preferences such as subscriptions & the social graph (following/connections) are routinely discounted in our feeds in favor of algorithm recommendations - platforms optimize for engagement & attention and not for utility & value to end users. We all respond to outrage & enjoy the occasional viral cat video but we should be able to tune & filter what gets shown to us. Have you ever heard a YouTuber tell you to hit the notification bell in addition to subscribing?

██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "Life is fraught with opportunities to keep your mouth shut." - [Winston Churchill](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/415384)

> "Preference falsification is an information theory term for the tendency for people to express a public preference that is different from their private, interior preference. For various reasons, certain preferences may not be publicly acceptable to express; they may be punished by execution, or labor camps, or exile, or social exclusion, or at the very least suspicion and a risk of some of these things. When people do not express their true preferences, they are deprived of the opportunity to coordinate with each other to create a more preferable outcome for both. Preference falsification is not just a political phenomenon, but a product of our dual nature, experiencing ourselves on the one hand from the privileged first-person perspective, and on the other hand from the imagined perspective of others. Pretending to have different preferences than one really does may be necessary to maintain a sense of safety, social belonging, and status." - [Weaponized Sacredness, by Sarah Perry](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/05/07/weaponized-sacredness/)
