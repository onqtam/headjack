“If it bleeds - it leads” - as a chapter name about media


> "There's a reason legacy media fought so hard to retain control. Losing their centralized chokepoint over information is truly at the level of the fall of communism." - [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1767749721156980935)


> "Instead of the story emerging according to the facts, the facts emerge according to the prevailing story." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1770219558990938294)

> "The only way out is through. We need to continue building even deeper and broader understanding of dynamics of narrative, and designing institutions that are structurally incapable of bending their output towards one or another official's preferred narrative. As a simple example, the CDC is currently responsible both for gathering and analyzing information around disease prevalence, and also making policy recommendations. In a narrative-aware world, we'd realize that this creates an irresistible temptation to control the data that is released so that the policy recommendations can seem more correct than they were. In that world those two functions would never be allowed to co-exist in the same organization.

> On the individual level, we need to rebuild our sensemaking mechanisms to assume that every piece of information we receive is colored by corrupt incentives, much like we refactored the technology stack of the internet away from the initial naive assumptions and towards security- and encryption-by default. Many areas of human endeavor, such as international diplomancy or even most business-to-business transactions already work on such principles, so it's nowhere near as onerous as it may seem. We just need to stop hoping that there is some far-away uncorrupted group of elders that will give us truth on a platter." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1770219558990938294)


> "An educational system that trains critical thinkers is incompatible with a system of government that requires the truth to be hidden. An empire of lies must devour its own children to survive." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1694068816425238663)


> "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you're mis-informed." - [Mark Twain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10001-if-you-don-t-read-the-newspaper-you-re-uninformed-if-you)

> "A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes." - [Mark Twain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76-a-lie-can-travel-half-way-around-the-world-while)


> "The cynics are people who haven't accomplished much themselves and stand on the sidelines, while criticizing the heroes who are on their fields of battle. They arrogantly pontificate about how those on the field aren't following the cynics' untested and impractical approaches. Cynics also love to point to the mistakes the heroes make, ignoring the reality that all successful people make plenty of mistakes. In the process, they conjure up unrealistic images that heroes must be perfect rather than imperfect but great and much more successful than unsuccessful.
>
> Too many people in the media are opinionated cynics with megaphones, and too few are true journalists trying to report unfolding stories in a balanced way. They have strong preferences to be much more critical than complementary, especially of people who have different inclinations than theirs, often so much so that they will intentionally distort the facts to help create stories of evil people in positions of power. Because their audiences seem to revel in tearing down people in power, that approach also sells well, which rewards them for such behavior." - [Ray Dalio](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4314488-why-no-heroes#:~:text=The%20cynics%20are,for%20such%20behavior.)

> "Wrong information always shown by the media

> Negative images is the main criteria

> "Freedom of the press is limited to those who own one." - [A. J. Liebling](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/177973-freedom-of-the-press-is-limited-to-those-who-own)

> "People everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news." - [A. J. Liebling](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/77035-people-everywhere-confuse-what-they-read-in-newspapers-with-news)

> "It is incredibly easy to manipulate us as to who counts as an Us, who as a Them." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1562507)

> "Brains distinguish between an Us and a Them in a fraction of a second. Subliminal processing of a Them activates the amygdala and insular cortex, brain regions that are all about fear, anxiety, aggression, and disgust." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1562506)

The opposite of divide and conquer is integration

> "Call the game the “Wall Street Game,” and people become less cooperative. Calling it the “Community Game” does the opposite." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8702794-call-the-game-the-wall-street-game-and-people-become)
