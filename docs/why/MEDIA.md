> "We live in media, as fish live in water." - [Ted Nelson](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1405368)


> "There's a reason legacy media fought so hard to retain control. Losing their centralized chokepoint over information is truly at the level of the fall of communism." - [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1767749721156980935)


> "Instead of the story emerging according to the facts, the facts emerge according to the prevailing story." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1770219558990938294)

> "The only way out is through. We need to continue building even deeper and broader understanding of dynamics of narrative, and designing institutions that are structurally incapable of bending their output towards one or another official's preferred narrative. As a simple example, the CDC is currently responsible both for gathering and analyzing information around disease prevalence, and also making policy recommendations. In a narrative-aware world, we'd realize that this creates an irresistible temptation to control the data that is released so that the policy recommendations can seem more correct than they were. In that world those two functions would never be allowed to co-exist in the same organization.
>
> On the individual level, we need to rebuild our sensemaking mechanisms to assume that every piece of information we receive is colored by corrupt incentives, much like we refactored the technology stack of the internet away from the initial naive assumptions and towards security- and encryption-by default. Many areas of human endeavor, such as international diplomancy or even most business-to-business transactions already work on such principles, so it's nowhere near as onerous as it may seem. We just need to stop hoping that there is some far-away uncorrupted group of elders that will give us truth on a platter." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1770219558990938294)


> "An educational system that trains critical thinkers is incompatible with a system of government that requires the truth to be hidden. An empire of lies must devour its own children to survive." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1694068816425238663)


> "If you don't read the newspaper, you're uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you're mis-informed." - [Mark Twain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10001-if-you-don-t-read-the-newspaper-you-re-uninformed-if-you)

> "A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes." - [Mark Twain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76-a-lie-can-travel-half-way-around-the-world-while)

> "Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/32526-whoever-is-careless-with-the-truth-in-small-matters-cannot)


> "The cynics are people who haven't accomplished much themselves and stand on the sidelines, while criticizing the heroes who are on their fields of battle. They arrogantly pontificate about how those on the field aren't following the cynics' untested and impractical approaches. Cynics also love to point to the mistakes the heroes make, ignoring the reality that all successful people make plenty of mistakes. In the process, they conjure up unrealistic images that heroes must be perfect rather than imperfect but great and much more successful than unsuccessful.
>
> Too many people in the media are opinionated cynics with megaphones, and too few are true journalists trying to report unfolding stories in a balanced way. They have strong preferences to be much more critical than complementary, especially of people who have different inclinations than theirs, often so much so that they will intentionally distort the facts to help create stories of evil people in positions of power. Because their audiences seem to revel in tearing down people in power, that approach also sells well, which rewards them for such behavior." - [Ray Dalio](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4314488-why-no-heroes#:~:text=The%20cynics%20are,for%20such%20behavior.)

> "Wrong information always shown by the media

> Negative images is the main criteria

> "Freedom of the press is limited to those who own one." - [A. J. Liebling](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/177973-freedom-of-the-press-is-limited-to-those-who-own)

> "People everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news." - [A. J. Liebling](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/77035-people-everywhere-confuse-what-they-read-in-newspapers-with-news)

> "Some long for the days of the 6pm newscast. This is most certainly a rose-colored view of the past. Those who recall this era remember being soothed by the packaging of the news. In hindsight, what we were watching was not a careful synthesis of fact-checked news but the opinions and interpretations of a small number of people with very limited expertise and even more limited information. It is only events like "Weapons of Mass Destruction" and others recently that have shown the limits of this process in the face of modern information, data, and analysis. I kept asking myself yesterday how different the WMD story would have been had it happened 20 years later. How would a generation of events have unfolded?" - [Steven Sinofsky](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1714709247685263419)

> "Their willingness to edit on the spot and pretend they got it right is insane, and a horrible innovation enabled by web journalism (as opposed to print). They should really be hashing/timestamping articles so they have to commit to their words." - [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1714663896282223098)

> "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities." - [Voltaire](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20527-those-who-can-make-you-believe-absurdities-can-make-you)


> "Lack of truth in most media is one of the vulnerabilities of our society. Besides giving us sensationalized distorted pictures, which leads to bad judgements, it is preventing great leaders from wanting to lead in politics and business." - [Ray Dalio](https://twitter.com/RayDalio/status/999781767312740352)

> "They'll get it all from you sooner or later 'cause they own this f**kin' place. It's a big club and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good, honest, hard-working people: white collar, blue collar, it doesn't matter what color shirt you have on." - [George Carlin](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/543644)

> "Keep in mind, the news media are not independent; they are a sort of bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class-the people who run things. Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by, and tolerated purely at the whim of, those who hold economic power. If the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something, it won't be on the news. Period. Or, at the very least, it will be slanted to suit them, and then rarely followed up." - [George Carlin](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/900399)

> "Our media, which is like a planetary nervous system, are far more sensitive to breakdowns than to breakthroughs. They filter out our creativity and successes, considering them less newsworthy than violence, war, and dissent. When we read newspapers and watch television news, we feel closer to a death in the social body than to an awakening." - [Barbara Marx Hubbard](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1175885)

> "When widespread internet access broke down our sense of a collective reality, what it was toppling was not the legacy of the Enlightenment, but instead an approximately 100-year bubble in media centralization." - [The Politics of Epistemic Fragmentation](https://modernmythology.net/the-politics-of-epistemic-fragmentation-175d6bbb98a4#:~:text=When%20widespread%20internet%20access%20broke%20down%20our%20sense%20of%20a%20collective%20reality%2C%20what%20it%20was%20toppling%20was%20not%20the%20legacy%20of%20the%20Enlightenment%2C%20but%20instead%20an%20approximately%20100%2Dyear%20bubble%20in%20media%20centralization.)

> "Morpheus: The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.

> Neo: What truth?

> Morpheus: That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind." - [Morpheus, The Matrix](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3861325-morpheus-the-matrix-is-everywhere-it-is-all-around-us)

> "If you eat, invest, and think according to what the ‘news’ advocates, you’ll end nutritionally, financially, and morally bankrupt." - [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/navalbot/status/1422648752691683331)

> "The key element of social control is the strategy of distraction that is to divert public attention from important issues and changes decided by political and economic elites, through the technique of flood or flooding continuous distractions and insignificant information." - [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/485177-the-key-element-of-social-control-is-the-strategy-of)

> "It is incredibly easy to manipulate us as to who counts as an Us, who as a Them." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1562507)

> "Brains distinguish between an Us and a Them in a fraction of a second. Subliminal processing of a Them activates the amygdala and insular cortex, brain regions that are all about fear, anxiety, aggression, and disgust." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1562506)

The opposite of divide and conquer is integration

> "If you want to make a society work, then you don’t keep underscoring the places where you’re different—you underscore your shared humanity" - [Sebastian Junger](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7691361-if-you-want-to-make-a-society-work-then-you)

> "All the media and the politicians ever talk about is things that separate us, things that make us different from one another." - [George Carlin](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1069412)

> "Propaganda is the executive arm of the invisible government." - [Edward Bernays](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4107781-propaganda-is-the-executive-arm-of-the-invisible-government)

> "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind." - [Edward Bernays](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/203430-the-conscious-and-intelligent-manipulation-of-the-organized-habits-and)

> "The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion. It is composed of inherited prejudices and symbols and cliches and verbal formulas supplied to them by the leaders." - [Edward Bernays](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8203803-no-serious-sociologist-any-longer-believes-that-the-voice-of#:~:text=The%20voice%20of%20the%20people%20expresses%20the,formulas%20supplied%20to%20them%20by%20the%20leaders.)

> "The only difference between 'propaganda' and 'education,' really, is in the point of view. The advocacy of what we believe in is education. The advocacy of what we don't believe in is propaganda." - [Edward Bernays](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1337319)

> "State propaganda, when supported by the educated classes and when no deviation is permitted from it, can have a big effect. It was a lesson learned by Hitler and many others, and it has been pursued to this day." - [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/519354-state-propaganda-when-supported-by-the-educated-classes-and-when)

> "The mass media serve as a system for communicating messages and symbols to the general populace. It is their function to amuse, entertain, and inform, and to inculcate individuals with the values, beliefs, and codes of behavior that will integrate them into the institutional structures of the larger society. In a world of concentrated wealth and major conflicts of class interest, to fulfil this role requires systematic propaganda." - [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7168920-the-mass-media-serve-as-a-system-for-communicating-messages)

> "Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state." - [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/386706-propaganda-is-to-a-democracy-what-the-bludgeon-is-to)

> "It is important to bear in mind that political campaigns are designed by the same people who sell toothpaste and cars." - [Noam Chomsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/590100-it-is-important-to-bear-in-mind-that-political-campaigns)
