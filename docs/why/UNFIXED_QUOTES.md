> "If I asked you who you are you'll tell me something but if I say we who are you without plants and you think about it and you think well who would you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist who would you be without the plants that produce the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist you were actually the emergent property of a biosphere that made you possible it was mediated by plants and they were mediated by insects and microbes and a whole bunch of things right and so you can define yourself without thinking about the atmosphere in plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea because you'd actually don't exist without all of them you are fundamentally interdependent with the whole rest of the biosphere not just Pasteur but the whole universe who are you without gravity some it's a nonsense question right who are you without electromagnetism it's a nonsense question so you are an emergent property of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing so if you think of earth as actually you zoom out and you look at it from the outside space-shuttle picture and you see that it's this tiny tiny little bitty organic spaceship traveling to this vast cosmos that's very inhospitable place and you realize that on this tiny little organic fragile spaceship together everything in there is interconnected profoundly and eggs are interconnected and the idea that there's this place called away where we can throw our trash and these people called others that we can bomb and it's beneficial get their resources whatever that engenders their enmity back that whatever wherever the trash goes is affecting the air the water that Deeley everyone is engaged with we have a level of technology that gives us global influence and everything that we do when we're talking here and the headphones that we're talking on have plastics and metals and silicates etc that came almost every continent that had people and supply chains around the whole world that were involved it took resources from the earth in ways that were fundamentally on renewable caused massive massive problems extinction level problems for many species and then turned it into trash on the other side we're doing these seemingly benign behaviors like buying stuff this is actually affecting this little spaceship that we live on in ways that make it self terminating very quickly we have a level of population that we never had it's been an exponential risin since then this revolution and a level of impact per capita within that population that again is exponential that cannot continue in this way but we also have the technological capability to make fundamental changes where we don't have an exponential growth society where we don't have an economic system that requires year-over-year exponential growth on a finite planet which how the would that make any sense to do an exponential growth economy forever or a linear materials economy that turns nature into trash on a finite planet." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=2553)

> "Well if we said we can burn coal but you can't leave the commons net worse so the same amount of co2 has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes to scrub the co2 out of the atmosphere scrub the mercury out mine in a way that is regenerative to the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies that do that well the cost to do that would make coal something like four orders of magnitude more expensive and solar would have reached grid parity the moment it was invented and so it's a nonsense economic system it is actually an extinction Airy economic system it not only allows but incentivizes external ization of harm to the Commons that is what led to coal making sense Oversoul right and so many other things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3087)

> "So the key thing that has to happen and in the future of macroeconomics is that we have to make sure that what we're incentivizing people and companies and what we're incentivizing agents to do is Omni positive so we're not giving anyone incentive meaning they get ahead economically by doing something that is fundamentally harming other agents arming the Commons otherwise we're continuing to cause the problems at the deepest level by incentivizing them based on what our counting systems right based on our value systems and so what we need is to incentivize things in relationship to how Omni positive they are which means you have to measure everything affected not just a few of the things but measure everything affected internalize all of those positives and negatives into the value equation and then incentivize things accordingly so to the degree that we make an incentive of any agent more close to perfectly aligned with the well-being of other agents in the Commons is the degree to which the economic system becomes a source for solutions to everything rather than us or for problems everything." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3205)

> "To the degree you succeed at it then you're trapped by the continuation of that curve forever so notice the smarter the kids are smart meaning good at that particular definition of smart the earlier we push them in the hyperspecialization right we want to get them in AP classes towards their specialty young and then the further we push them in specialization so by the time they do their dissertation 10 people in the world know what the fuck they're talking about so they know so much about such a narrow area so they're not thinking about big picture things or thing interdisciplinary things at all that means that the smartest people aren't actually questioning macroeconomics and questioning culture and questioning governance questioning the foundational axioms of how we do academia or science because they're they're just doing one tiny little thing so we're training them to be very sharp cogs in the industrial way yeah that's true and the only people are usually left thinking about any big picture things are people that didn't have those types of proclivities and that is that your way of taking things that could be dangerous and making them not only not dangerous but very good tools of the continuation of a particular system and so because you didn't actually do that well at it then you were able to say fuck it I don't want to do something totally different." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=540)

> "If the kid who gets a 4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is making no mistakes right like that's how you that's how you write that is that you need everything right and everything perfect now everything right means you learned what had already been figured out was the Orthodox truth and you were able to repeat it effectively right and then at a certain point once you understand that system completely enough you can extend it a little bit which you know in the postdoc level you take the current whatever the field is an extended a tiny bit after proving that you understood it you know perfectly people who got a lot of praise and a lot of success and identity around never making any mistakes and getting everything perfect are not oriented to do things that have a very high risk of failure that's great so true so when when kids are praised for getting things right you [ __ ] them up because a number of things one so think about this in general all the praise that kids get is when they do something that the authority wants them to do and has already designated as right and good and true right so whether it's the teacher the preacher of the parents they get praised for doing what someone else wanted them to do they almost always get punishment for doing things that made sense to them that they wanted to do so this is how you conditioned people to be well you know cogs within an authoritarian system where we defer our own agency our ability to assess the world in our own agency to somebody that knows better than us and the teacher the preacher the parent right they all represent that and then it becomes the boss and the you know macroeconomy the state the etc writ large and so if we want people that actually can really be innovative we can't train them that way we have to train them to self assess and self initiate and not actually get hits of praise from getting something right that others already figured out and when we do that like oftentimes there's a kid who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or math genius because they just happen to fucking figure out like how spelling works or how math works and they got so much praise for it and they weren't getting enough unconditional love otherwise that they were optimizing for the extrinsic reward associated with the math of getting the prey is even though they might actually hate math or be not terribly interested in that they just happened to get it if you didn't do that then you might find math is alright but they're actually fascinated by art and so then they can become very good at something they have no passion for and it's all based on extrinsic motive that is damaging intrinsic motive." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=704)

> "Let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in London we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral [ __ ] problem - having your moral legitimacy as the United States of America beautiful Constitution Declaration of Independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after Germany's genocide they're [ __ ] up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the Native American people employing the slavery of the Africans and we mean real [ __ ] slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got Jim Crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the [ __ ] work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the [ __ ] jobs and who wants to [ __ ] jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice [ __ ] yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and I which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but I don't get a cut and pick right if I cut and pick there's something [ __ ] up or you can cut and I'll pick but anyone who says I wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey [ __ ] everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst I'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a [ __ ] ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of Victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post Martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show you just as much [ __ ] research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether I'm looking at pH or I'm looking at insulin levels or I'm looking at telomere levels like I'll get different answers and also which populations but when I try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million [ __ ] metrics that we can't calculate I can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because I'm studying a very complex system in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really [ __ ] clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to Abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of Co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read Foucault or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when I say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the British to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had [ __ ] muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through Wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to [ __ ] deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=1114)
