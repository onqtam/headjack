> "They ask why is fire hot it's the same kind of thing right like well we can talk about what the photon releasing is and how photons are exchanging energy in the hand but then why are my subjectively experiencing it as hot and so what happens is we just don't know so we don't answer their questions well and we instead steer them to things that we do know that are really not interesting like how to spell something or what the capital is something that is and we turn them off to schooling we turn them off to learning turn them off to their innate fascination of existing so when we look at the whole issue of the kind of welfare model dynamic where we think if people are not capitalistic aliy motivated they'll just watch TV all the time kids are so intrinsically motivated to learn everything they can and to build stuff and to create and to like want to go to work with mom or dad and figure out how to do stuff what happens is when we don't facilitate their interests and then we actively force them to be interested in that's just not interesting to them because there's more to do with memorization and getting it right than understanding mechanics in or dynamics and interesting ways we break their innate intrinsic interest in life and make them deferring to extrinsic Authority and then they just want to get away from that which ends up looking like play chill out is some form of you know escape from broken interest in life so the future of Education has the ability to have polymath be the new normal you know comprehensively developed multimodal genius as the new normal because that's actually innate to every child a friendly facility." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=502)

> "If I asked you who you are you'll tell me something but if I say we who are you without plants and you think about it and you think well who would you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist who would you be without the plants that produce the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist you were actually the emergent property of a biosphere that made you possible it was mediated by plants and they were mediated by insects and microbes and a whole bunch of things right and so you can define yourself without thinking about the atmosphere in plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea because you'd actually don't exist without all of them you are fundamentally interdependent with the whole rest of the biosphere not just Pasteur but the whole universe who are you without gravity some it's a nonsense question right who are you without electromagnetism it's a nonsense question so you are an emergent property of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing so if you think of earth as actually you zoom out and you look at it from the outside space-shuttle picture and you see that it's this tiny tiny little bitty organic spaceship traveling to this vast cosmos that's very inhospitable place and you realize that on this tiny little organic fragile spaceship together everything in there is interconnected profoundly and eggs are interconnected and the idea that there's this place called away where we can throw our trash and these people called others that we can bomb and it's beneficial get their resources whatever that engenders their enmity back that whatever wherever the trash goes is affecting the air the water that Deeley everyone is engaged with we have a level of technology that gives us global influence and everything that we do when we're talking here and the headphones that we're talking on have plastics and metals and silicates etc that came almost every continent that had people and supply chains around the whole world that were involved it took resources from the earth in ways that were fundamentally on renewable caused massive massive problems extinction level problems for many species and then turned it into trash on the other side we're doing these seemingly benign behaviors like buying stuff this is actually affecting this little spaceship that we live on in ways that make it self terminating very quickly we have a level of population that we never had it's been an exponential risin since then this revolution and a level of impact per capita within that population that again is exponential that cannot continue in this way but we also have the technological capability to make fundamental changes where we don't have an exponential growth society where we don't have an economic system that requires year-over-year exponential growth on a finite planet which how the would that make any sense to do an exponential growth economy forever or a linear materials economy that turns nature into trash on a finite planet." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=2553)

> "Well if we said we can burn coal but you can't leave the commons net worse so the same amount of co2 has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes to scrub the co2 out of the atmosphere scrub the mercury out mine in a way that is regenerative to the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies that do that well the cost to do that would make coal something like four orders of magnitude more expensive and solar would have reached grid parity the moment it was invented and so it's a nonsense economic system it is actually an extinction Airy economic system it not only allows but incentivizes external ization of harm to the Commons that is what led to coal making sense Oversoul right and so many other things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3087)

> "So the key thing that has to happen and in the future of macroeconomics is that we have to make sure that what we're incentivizing people and companies and what we're incentivizing agents to do is Omni positive so we're not giving anyone incentive meaning they get ahead economically by doing something that is fundamentally harming other agents arming the Commons otherwise we're continuing to cause the problems at the deepest level by incentivizing them based on what our counting systems right based on our value systems and so what we need is to incentivize things in relationship to how Omni positive they are which means you have to measure everything affected not just a few of the things but measure everything affected internalize all of those positives and negatives into the value equation and then incentivize things accordingly so to the degree that we make an incentive of any agent more close to perfectly aligned with the well-being of other agents in the Commons is the degree to which the economic system becomes a source for solutions to everything rather than us or for problems everything." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3205)

> "To the degree you succeed at it then you're trapped by the continuation of that curve forever so notice the smarter the kids are smart meaning good at that particular definition of smart the earlier we push them in the hyperspecialization right we want to get them in AP classes towards their specialty young and then the further we push them in specialization so by the time they do their dissertation 10 people in the world know what the fuck they're talking about so they know so much about such a narrow area so they're not thinking about big picture things or thing interdisciplinary things at all that means that the smartest people aren't actually questioning macroeconomics and questioning culture and questioning governance questioning the foundational axioms of how we do academia or science because they're they're just doing one tiny little thing so we're training them to be very sharp cogs in the industrial way yeah that's true and the only people are usually left thinking about any big picture things are people that didn't have those types of proclivities and that is that your way of taking things that could be dangerous and making them not only not dangerous but very good tools of the continuation of a particular system and so because you didn't actually do that well at it then you were able to say fuck it I don't want to do something totally different." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=540)

> "If the kid who gets a 4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is making no mistakes right like that's how you that's how you write that is that you need everything right and everything perfect now everything right means you learned what had already been figured out was the Orthodox truth and you were able to repeat it effectively right and then at a certain point once you understand that system completely enough you can extend it a little bit which you know in the postdoc level you take the current whatever the field is an extended a tiny bit after proving that you understood it you know perfectly people who got a lot of praise and a lot of success and identity around never making any mistakes and getting everything perfect are not oriented to do things that have a very high risk of failure that's great so true so when when kids are praised for getting things right you [ __ ] them up because a number of things one so think about this in general all the praise that kids get is when they do something that the authority wants them to do and has already designated as right and good and true right so whether it's the teacher the preacher of the parents they get praised for doing what someone else wanted them to do they almost always get punishment for doing things that made sense to them that they wanted to do so this is how you conditioned people to be well you know cogs within an authoritarian system where we defer our own agency our ability to assess the world in our own agency to somebody that knows better than us and the teacher the preacher the parent right they all represent that and then it becomes the boss and the you know macroeconomy the state the etc writ large and so if we want people that actually can really be innovative we can't train them that way we have to train them to self assess and self initiate and not actually get hits of praise from getting something right that others already figured out and when we do that like oftentimes there's a kid who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or math genius because they just happen to fucking figure out like how spelling works or how math works and they got so much praise for it and they weren't getting enough unconditional love otherwise that they were optimizing for the extrinsic reward associated with the math of getting the prey is even though they might actually hate math or be not terribly interested in that they just happened to get it if you didn't do that then you might find math is alright but they're actually fascinated by art and so then they can become very good at something they have no passion for and it's all based on extrinsic motive that is damaging intrinsic motive." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=704)

> "Let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in London we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral [ __ ] problem - having your moral legitimacy as the United States of America beautiful Constitution Declaration of Independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after Germany's genocide they're [ __ ] up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the Native American people employing the slavery of the Africans and we mean real [ __ ] slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got Jim Crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the [ __ ] work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the [ __ ] jobs and who wants to [ __ ] jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice [ __ ] yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and I which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but I don't get a cut and pick right if I cut and pick there's something [ __ ] up or you can cut and I'll pick but anyone who says I wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey [ __ ] everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst I'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a [ __ ] ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of Victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post Martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show you just as much [ __ ] research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether I'm looking at pH or I'm looking at insulin levels or I'm looking at telomere levels like I'll get different answers and also which populations but when I try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million [ __ ] metrics that we can't calculate I can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because I'm studying a very complex system in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really [ __ ] clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to Abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of Co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read Foucault or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when I say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the British to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had [ __ ] muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through Wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to [ __ ] deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=1114)

> "When in the depression there were people openly on the streets discussing socialism Marxism lazy fair capitalism because the system was failed right you in a failed state people are open to like look at any possibility we are very near a failed state and we're actually very near a failed civilization globally so when you look at climate change and the fact that we can't [ __ ] get it right right like we can't get it right we we keep driving ourselves towards the point of self induced catastrophe and possibly extinction and despite the fact that the Club of Rome identified this over shooting limits in this 60s right and and limits of growth in the world through model the spoon despite the fact that it's been called that we're following the model we keep progressing on the [ __ ] model right the Paris Accord was not enough for us to make it we would have everything would have been [ __ ] if we did the Paris Accord and we couldn't even do that right and so and that's driven mostly by our current structure of capitalism because if I over fished the ocean right if I use a mile long drift net and I take all these [ __ ] fish out of the ocean that's more money for my fishing company this quarter and leaving them in the ocean is worth nothing to me economically now it's worth something in the future but the other guy is going to fish them out if I don't fish them out so it's not like I can leave them there for the future so it is a competitive race for near-term wins mortgaging the future so we make thirteen species a day extinct on average we've fished out 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a 3/4 water planet that took 3 billion years to get all that [ __ ] life and in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we fished out 90% of the large fish species extincted many of them 80% of the old-growth trees gone that's capitalism working really great not working really great right we're on the verge of a very realistic AI apocalypse where we should be developing the area very slowly we should be very intelligently looking at what it because unlike you know when when Edison's working on a light bulb and light bulb fails it just doesn't work maybe it blows up no big deal you do it inside of a container you work on AI and it fails and sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it kills everything because it is an autopoietic tech it is a self-organizing self authoring tech light bulb isn't it works or it doesn't work but it's built on the outside but but biotech right where you make a new [ __ ] life-form and now it replicates and it does its own mutation that is a self-replicating tech where if you get it wrong you don't get a stop it and nuclear wasn't right nuclear is a reaction and then it stops it's really bad but nanotech biotech and AI are autopoietic self-replicating tech that might be depending upon how we do them in commensurate with biological life as we understand it with faster feedback loops than us now we should develop that as slow as [ __ ] possible because the upsides are awesome but we should do it in highly controlled safe to fail environments but all of the fiscal incentive is getting to market first that's a capitalist incentive who gets to market first where we're in a race towards the cliff and the arms race is the same thing why do we have when Carl Sagan showed us in the early 80s that it only took four 100-megaton bombs to kill all life on Earth with a nuclear winter why do we have 600 times that many like why the [ __ ] do you keep making nukes after you have enough to kill everything down to viruses because if you have a for-profit military-industrial complex where you have a source of supply where you need to manufacture more demand to keep your supply going it's not like supply and demand is a real thing there's an initial demand you create a supply but now you you have supply and you manufacture artificial demand which is why we buy all kinds of [ __ ] that doesn't make us happy that we think will make us happy because marketing creates artificial bland so capitalism is actually broken existentially so there are people who learned that okay Marxism had some nice ideas and there were some good ideas it didn't actually end up working out that well no of course if we really go study if we never implemented Marxism just like we've never implemented lazy faire capitalism we've implemented weird models of capitalism and by the time the USSR came around it was nothing like Marxism for a bunch of reasons but Marxism doesn't actually work at scale it it works that kind of model works at a hundred and fifty person tribal model it doesn't extend beyond it capitalism did seem to work but of the cost of radical externality that externality when you get to this many people in this much tech actually self implodes so what has worked up to this point worked worked epic at but you when we say it worked up to this point we have been utilizing unknowable resources moving towards the point of criticality the whole time and it has required war right and it has led to diseases we didn't have before because of environmental devastation and etc and we have a world war today almost everyone has low-grade mental illness like Luba quit Asst addiction ubiquitous low-grade anxiety existential angst fairly decent low-grade depression right these are not natural to the human condition tribal people don't have this [ __ ] in the same way so we say it works define work this is optimizing for some metrics at the expense of others in a complex system so the fact that there are people questioning is there a [ __ ] better system than this because we're not fixing climate change in the system where it's still more profitable to do the [ __ ] up thing with a perverse incentive is ubiquitous in health care why do we do biohacking stuff like why doesn't health care prevent diseases because there's no [ __ ] money in preventing diseases there's a lot of money in treating them there's no there's not that much in curing them but there's a lot in treating them forever so what is gonna get researched when the money goes in has to have ROI back out of the capitalist system so the fact that people are recognizing that in questioning is a very good thing now the fact they try to find other things that didn't work as the answer is just a basic basically hopelessness and a lack of knowing how to go about solving something so [ __ ] hard so one of the core foe of my life is what is the macroeconomy of the future what are the governance system sort of the civilization systems they can allow us to actually human together well without needing to go to war and unknowable use of resource and producing a bit with this mental and physical illness that's unnecessary and etc and it's not any system that has ever happened so we can get into that if you want to or we can go to other directions but also most of the young people who say communism what they're really saying is Denmark looks better than here like that's a social kind of dynamic where better access to medicine don't have a lot of homeless people masters to PhD is average level of education largely secular because of that like the Nordic countries just look better they are they're just [ __ ] better there's more socialized dynamics now are they better on every metric no if you look here we have a tremendous amount of innovation here because of certain types of freedoms and a tremendous amount of damage and our bell curve is very spread out and so for everyone who's not winning at the system to say nobody is losing as bad in Denmark as they are here and there's a lot less of them and they're not ruining the environment as fast they're actually figuring their trash problem out maybe let's actually think about this and I'm actually not proposing Denmark as a solution I am saying there are a lot of things that are actually evidentially better on meaningful metrics and things that are adequate to the scope of what do we do with almost 8 billion people and distributed exponential technology don't yet exist." - [Daniel

> "When you think about grammar if you just look at the superficial definition of grammar you see that it has to do with the constraints surrounding the way in which our expressions our words our phrases can be put together such that meaning emerges from them that is comprehensible by other actors who are the receivers of these expressions that's grammar grammar is the way the order the way in which we pluck from possibility space the giant possibility spaces that we've been talking about specific combinations that actually are able to communicate information and coordinate action and so when i'm talking about this grammar of emergence or axioms of emergence what i'm trying to kind of get at is a a different way of approaching the ontology and epistemology of our world or of our reality of the way that most people begin to think about or work or try to ascertain an understanding of the things that are happening around them. So you know one like if we go all the way back to the beginning of this question you know we realize that if we accept the axiom or if we accept the idea that all structure must emerge bottom up and then those structures can parameterize other previously emergent structures top down right so like things have to actually come into being from simpler structures into spaces of more complexity and they don't always have to go monotonically or only in that direction like you can have you know complexity catastrophe you can have collapse you know that can be kind of a random walk to some extent but the whole point is that when we see complex objects you know especially in a world before we had any frame of reference for talking about emergence or bottom bottom-up order how did we approach reality how do we approach understanding well we came at it from an outside-in perspective we came at it from a top-down perspective from that initial perspective we were coming from the outside in we were coming from the highest states of complexity and trying to reduce them to simpler rules which is part of that dissective frame of reference we were talking about earlier so you know for the majority of modernity one might even consider that the entire foundation of modernity is related to this idea that we are able to take complex structures operate from the outside in peeling back those layers bringing them into parts creating ontologies that allow us to categorize those parts and then uh developing tools techniques or frameworks specializations specialized domains with respect to being able to perform work based on the knowledge we've gained and that's gotten us quite far you know there's a lot of utility in that i mean i'm not denigrating that in any way but what we're coming to realize is that we're now in a phase where so much of our ability to take the next step depends on far more integrated processes and as anyone who's taking a calculus class can tell you integration is exponentially more difficult than differentiation right and i think there's a fundamental reality fundamental truth there it's not just because you're doing calculus it's because of the fact that when you're doing something like differentiation you can apply locally bounded rules right which is very similar to the reductive paradigm where you can basically dissect reality into local subsets of reality that behave predictably but when it comes to integration you need a far broader understanding of the dynamics and tendencies of the systems that might be involved and also there's this element of intuition to it in many ways integration is much more of an art form it's much more difficult to to fully reduce to analytic equations and so i use grammar to talk about this process as opposed to you know the mathematics i mean axioms are similar right but axioms are actually one might say the grammar of any given mathematical perspective and i say mathematical perspective because the perspective of possibilities in any given mathematical domain emerge from the axioms right the axioms are the fundamental combinatoric kernels of that mathematical space and how they are put together all of the possibilities of how they are put together constitute all the domain of possible expressions in that mathematical space mathematicians then go through that possible space you know examining trying to basically find certain expressions that they can connect to other expressions such that they can demonstrate within those axioms that they are true so it's a kind of a closed system but but grammar and language on the other hand is a generative and open system in the sense that our language is evolving our grammar tends to evolve and the degree of permanence that structures that are generated by our grammar attain is related pragmatically mostly to their function in the world do they actually perform useful work and can they be recombined with other structures to perform useful work which is a much more pragmatic perspective than the formal or analytic perspective of mathematics and so i think that in what we're beginning to see now what is beginning to emerge across a number of domains you know at the santa fe institute at some other complexity research institutes with respect to you know certain researchers and theoretical biology as well we're starting to generate narratives and grammars around how we can think about patterns that are not domain specific and how those patterns those grammars of emergence can be used as containers or locations rallying points let's say for the process of coming to synthesize or integrate all of this domain specific knowledge that we have generated that are currently you know we kind of currently have this landscape this post babel landscape of hyper specialization and to some extent there's a great deal of value that we can derive from reintegrating some of that and reintegration requires translation requires grammar and i don't think that we're going to find the ability to reintegrate or or successfully integrate across those different specializations those domains through further grammars of differentiation through more reduction we have to be able to find synthesis and and that's very much what i would say this entire next episteme or this entire next paradigm that we're moving into is going to be about." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://youtu.be/yrCW5jvBhm0?t=3405)

> "In the repeated prisoner's dilemma for example the most crucial condition is that the probability of another round has to be greater than the cost to benefit ratio if that is the case there is a chance that natural selection favors cooperation if there is not the case there is no chance so if you say there could be situations in the real world where that temptation to defect is so high that this debt probability of continuation it just this mechanism is not operating then this is in agreement with our analysis you need something else and what you could say what you need and our institutions and in our field we have also began to analyze the effect of institutions which is a fascinating world and became into debt sort of in two steps the one was the proposal that you can stabilize cooperation with punishment and the punishment that was introduced was a pure punishment where people can sort of cooperate in a public goods game a public good game is a prisoner's dilemma with more than two people or not and afterwards they can actually pay something to take away from somebody else and we call this peer punishment and this peer punishment can lead to people cooperating in the public goods game but it has the problem that actually it would lead to retaliation in situations where I'm if I get punished you know I could try to retaliate against the punishment instead of increasing my cooperation so beer punishment is something that works in some circumstances but actually whenever that mechanism of interaction is possible I find it's more likely being used to detrimental effect other than upholding public cooperation because it is in order to reinforce dominance of some individuals over others and most institutions want Excel to make sure that this peer punishment is not what is happening because that would destroy the productivity in the group so instead of letting individual people punish in those situations the next step is to say let's have an institution and the institution could then give punishment to people who defect in the public goods game and in our analysis this is usually done in such a way that first the people are asked are you willing to pay money in order to establish such a institution if enough people pay for that institution that institution comes into effect and then whoever defects in the public good game is automatically punished by that institution and that seems to work much better than peer punishment and that would be the argument in favor of institution." - [Martin Nowak: 'The Evolution of Cooperation' | 2015 ISNIE Annual Meeting](https://youtu.be/A8Y0kCdYoug?t=2870)



> "I actually think climate change is gonna require a new set of global governments a new form of global governance that we haven't even imagined yet I don't exactly know what it's gonna be but when I think about the issues like solar to engineering I don't think the UN is up for the task and I don't think the framework of the Paris agreement or anything else like that is really capable I think something new is going to emerge and it's not going to emerge because of altruism or because we all have some enlightenment I think it's gonna be because of necessity you know HG Wells had a great line I think it was in the time machine where he wrote we are kept keen on a grindstone of pain and necessity and I think there's a truth to that that that a lot of the innovation in the 21st century is gonna come not because we're enlightened or we reach some kind of spiritual connection with the earth system but because frankly we're up against it and we have to innovate or or fail to survive." - [Daniel Schrag](https://youtu.be/qCJLkwzNy_4?t=5345)

> "Economists who have been the most insightful in my opinion are the ones that have focused on what's happening inside companies because I think economists have to start investigating more and more non market mechanisms not as the exception to the economy but is perhaps the heart of the economy with the market mechanism just being a necessary important efficient part of a much larger tool set of social technologies this sometimes gets brought up with public policy and so on so people may talk about governance interventions they might talk about the economics of decision making policymaking and so on but you know except for coats's theory of the firm I don't see much work on how internal organization of companies might work arguably the one of the genius points of Silicon Valley has been to focus what happens within your startup and focusing on things like company culture no no let's assume company culture is real and let's assume that it is as tangible a future of the company you know the social technologies you use internally as any product might be and I think they've reinvented something completely different." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/FyJa_TnwSB4?t=578)

> "Society is not automatic I think it's fundamentally an artificial process that we've constructed to a significant degree our civilization relies on Cornerstone institutions and various kinds of knowledge uh to persist into the indefinite Future these are not natural phenomena social engineering has been employed at every major Reformation or transformation of society therefore I think the appreciation for this infrastructure and also an understanding that we have to be intentional about its renewal rather than rely on society evolving in its own way Society evolving in its own way is just the actions of other people transforming it so I think the basic idea is a civilization as a collection of symbiotic institutions." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=161)

> "Flourishing institutions I would argue are uh functional institutions so this means that they fulfill uh their given purpose they also tend to be adaptive so I believe that you know automated processes can't really process information the way human beings can so if you have this purely bureaucratic system where people are collecting records uh such as might exist in an organization like the IRS perhaps it's a well-functioning machine but without key uh individuals that have the ability to transform and reform such an organization it can truly be adaptive and change to uh differing circumstances so I think that when civilizational failure has occurred in the past it was because either the automated structure these big you know bureaucratic structures be it say the Catholic church at one point in medieval history or be it something like the IRS they either broke down from lack of Maintenance or they were functioning as designed but their environment transformed so I think to have flourishing institutions you need to have flourishing people you need to have individuals who understand the actual social fabric of the working of an organization by this I mean how things get done we all have this very rich tcid knowledge uh when we work in our own professional environment but often have these very vague imprecise thoughts about different domains of society where we just take the face value descriptions and run with them everyone's environment is quite information rich I know of no organization where the written description of the organization and how it actually works are the same thing and I've yet to hear a satisfying description of Human Social Life right in other words the task of anthropology that to you know study human beings as such is incomplete so as we operate with imperfect knowledge and we try to understand the world around us those of us who are a little bit more successful at this task of understanding can build and redirect institutions so that they can adapt to any sort of changing circumstance that might arise and you know the historical evidence for this is is quite solid you have these states that overcome events like massive climate change such as drought and so on they undertake new irrigation projects or they might compensate that irrigation is no longer viable by you know conquering new lands or they might set up a system of grain storage the difference between you know a society or civilization that fails because of natural resource constraints and the ones that succeed is often this adaptability to the changing parameters of both natural and the geopolitical world around them." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=366)

> "I think that with the iPhone in particular it was a brilliant leap that easily might have been decades in the future before someone found that sort of product if you think about it the Brilliance is in teaching the users what they wanted no one was really asking for the kind of device Steve Jobs built no one was expecting it right they were expecting miniaturized specialized devices closer to iPods than iPhones." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=609)

> "We underestimate the value of long-term thinking combined with brilliant Vision I think we are too interested in process controls there's a discussion that government stalemate and the sort of do nothing congress are features rather than bugs people are so worried about the negative outlier and you know some people might see Trump is that outlier there were people arguing Obama was that negative outlier do I think that's clearly not panned out but I feel we have not paid enough attention to the positive potential of human organizations is best expressed by its positive outliers and if you produce a system that by Design constrains individuals and constrains humans you have cut out that positive potential as much as you might have cut out the negative potential so I think Singapore works great because there was a leanu around if there was not a leanu around the authoritarian government might have been very very negative it might have ended up squandering some of Singapore's good advantages and natural advantages but let's remember when Singapore started off its GDP per capita was lower than that of Jamaica today Jamaica is a wonderful place to visit it's a nice Caribbean country but it's not a first world country of the states of post colonial states Singapore is the only country to have traveled from third world to First that's a remarkable achievement and if we only endorse systems of government and sort of these kind of overly strict limitations and what you can and cannot do while in government we will cut out the positive potentialities of those kinds of transition to our own detriment." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=1108)

> "It sounds like the key thing that you shared in there is the increase in sharing and transparency and thus collaboration and thus collective intelligence and collective capacity where the current incentive structure incentivizes owning and hoarding IP and making sure nobody else uses the things that you discovered because you're gonna make your money on patents and not sharing what you're learning until it's published because the whole thing is published know that really what you're talking about is the ability to change the information ecology the incentives that change the information ecology from ones that incentivize hoarding information and making it hard for other people to use they have to pay for license and even dis informing - one that maximizes informing sharing and collaboration." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OUv-ZOM0dOo?t=2540)

> "The first we talked about a little bit which is the ability to keep records or as our friend Michael Bastyr talks about it the ability to actually deliver justice which he defines as making sure that the loops are closed the value created needs to be value returned and that externalities need to be returned to the critters of externalities right and if you have injustice if you have bad records in a system if you don't have the ability to determine who created how much value and who created how much externality and thereby return it then you get a system that the drifts quite rapidly I mean where a lot of strategies are about stealing credit and avoiding responsibility so that's one piece or so one piece is just radically increasing the quality of the records that are being kept and therefore closing more and more loops which is say creating more and more justice...

> It's not that people have to become sort of more pro bono it's just that the good things they do will be noticed and rewarded and the bad things they do will be noticed and punished done right it's pretty simple like that's straightforward as long as you can provide that framework where people have clean boundaries and good choices or rewarding bad choices are punished they will begin to move in that direction the beginning to move in direction on mass." - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/OUv-ZOM0dOo?t=2591)

> "I think a big part of it has to do with this is this notion of gold has no smell meaning that again you know person a shows up in the in the market with ten apples and person B shows up in the market with five apples the fact that person a stole those apples from person B is since of the market in may have no capacity to perceive at all and in fact we don't even think about that as a market transaction that's called justice that's what happened so what we says okay well person B then needs to find some way to sue or otherwise rebalance the underlying infrastructure so we would think about then is that the market is consisting of a whole bunch of little circles that are communicating with each other through transactions and it doesn't actually have any information outside of that information flow so it has in an inability to perceive all the different ways that somebody might actually falsify the stuff that the market actually needs to be able to make good choices meaning that if you think about what the game the startup do the right thing and it slides all the way down if everybody who's playing the market game is self-enforcing to do the right thing you know social norms would really really work and anybody who plays in anything but the most virtuous way is selected against through the sort of to the normative channel then the mark so we'll actually tend to do a pretty good job well there's more to it than that and there's a whole bunch of other stuff to think about that but that's one that we can focus on right here and but that's the sense markets actually have very little ability to perceive that kind of a thing in fact they outsource that to other areas social norms laws etc that's the channel you gain are you game that channel and so you show up as a really great market player you're a bank you've got a giant building with marble columns and a actually completely covered in marble and impress the people wearing fancy suits that all signal certain things that the market can perceive but you know the gap between signal and the thing being signified is something the market has effectively no capacity to perceive at all and that then becomes the game when you move more and more and more power and choice making into the market you end up basically creating a niche for gaming what the market can't perceive and simulating what the market perceives as being a good answer." - [Jordan Hall](https://youtu.be/OUv-ZOM0dOo?t=2728)
