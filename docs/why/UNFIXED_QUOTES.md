> "Let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in London we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral [ __ ] problem - having your moral legitimacy as the United States of America beautiful Constitution Declaration of Independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after Germany's genocide they're [ __ ] up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the Native American people employing the slavery of the Africans and we mean real [ __ ] slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got Jim Crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the [ __ ] work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the [ __ ] jobs and who wants to [ __ ] jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice [ __ ] yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and I which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but I don't get a cut and pick right if I cut and pick there's something [ __ ] up or you can cut and I'll pick but anyone who says I wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey [ __ ] everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst I'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a [ __ ] ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of Victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post Martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show you just as much [ __ ] research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether I'm looking at pH or I'm looking at insulin levels or I'm looking at telomere levels like I'll get different answers and also which populations but when I try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million [ __ ] metrics that we can't calculate I can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because I'm studying a very complex system in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really [ __ ] clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to Abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of Co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read Foucault or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when I say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the British to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had [ __ ] muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through Wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to [ __ ] deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=1114)

> "When in the depression there were people openly on the streets discussing socialism Marxism lazy fair capitalism because the system was failed right you in a failed state people are open to like look at any possibility we are very near a failed state and we're actually very near a failed civilization globally so when you look at climate change and the fact that we can't [ __ ] get it right right like we can't get it right we we keep driving ourselves towards the point of self induced catastrophe and possibly extinction and despite the fact that the Club of Rome identified this over shooting limits in this 60s right and and limits of growth in the world through model the spoon despite the fact that it's been called that we're following the model we keep progressing on the [ __ ] model right the Paris Accord was not enough for us to make it we would have everything would have been [ __ ] if we did the Paris Accord and we couldn't even do that right and so and that's driven mostly by our current structure of capitalism because if I over fished the ocean right if I use a mile long drift net and I take all these [ __ ] fish out of the ocean that's more money for my fishing company this quarter and leaving them in the ocean is worth nothing to me economically now it's worth something in the future but the other guy is going to fish them out if I don't fish them out so it's not like I can leave them there for the future so it is a competitive race for near-term wins mortgaging the future so we make thirteen species a day extinct on average we've fished out 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a 3/4 water planet that took 3 billion years to get all that [ __ ] life and in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we fished out 90% of the large fish species extincted many of them 80% of the old-growth trees gone that's capitalism working really great not working really great right we're on the verge of a very realistic AI apocalypse where we should be developing the area very slowly we should be very intelligently looking at what it because unlike you know when when Edison's working on a light bulb and light bulb fails it just doesn't work maybe it blows up no big deal you do it inside of a container you work on AI and it fails and sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it kills everything because it is an autopoietic tech it is a self-organizing self authoring tech light bulb isn't it works or it doesn't work but it's built on the outside but but biotech right where you make a new [ __ ] life-form and now it replicates and it does its own mutation that is a self-replicating tech where if you get it wrong you don't get a stop it and nuclear wasn't right nuclear is a reaction and then it stops it's really bad but nanotech biotech and AI are autopoietic self-replicating tech that might be depending upon how we do them in commensurate with biological life as we understand it with faster feedback loops than us now we should develop that as slow as [ __ ] possible because the upsides are awesome but we should do it in highly controlled safe to fail environments but all of the fiscal incentive is getting to market first that's a capitalist incentive who gets to market first where we're in a race towards the cliff and the arms race is the same thing why do we have when Carl Sagan showed us in the early 80s that it only took four 100-megaton bombs to kill all life on Earth with a nuclear winter why do we have 600 times that many like why the [ __ ] do you keep making nukes after you have enough to kill everything down to viruses because if you have a for-profit military-industrial complex where you have a source of supply where you need to manufacture more demand to keep your supply going it's not like supply and demand is a real thing there's an initial demand you create a supply but now you you have supply and you manufacture artificial demand which is why we buy all kinds of [ __ ] that doesn't make us happy that we think will make us happy because marketing creates artificial bland so capitalism is actually broken existentially so there are people who learned that okay Marxism had some nice ideas and there were some good ideas it didn't actually end up working out that well no of course if we really go study if we never implemented Marxism just like we've never implemented lazy faire capitalism we've implemented weird models of capitalism and by the time the USSR came around it was nothing like Marxism for a bunch of reasons but Marxism doesn't actually work at scale it it works that kind of model works at a hundred and fifty person tribal model it doesn't extend beyond it capitalism did seem to work but of the cost of radical externality that externality when you get to this many people in this much tech actually self implodes so what has worked up to this point worked worked epic at but you when we say it worked up to this point we have been utilizing unknowable resources moving towards the point of criticality the whole time and it has required war right and it has led to diseases we didn't have before because of environmental devastation and etc and we have a world war today almost everyone has low-grade mental illness like Luba quit Asst addiction ubiquitous low-grade anxiety existential angst fairly decent low-grade depression right these are not natural to the human condition tribal people don't have this [ __ ] in the same way so we say it works define work this is optimizing for some metrics at the expense of others in a complex system so the fact that there are people questioning is there a [ __ ] better system than this because we're not fixing climate change in the system where it's still more profitable to do the [ __ ] up thing with a perverse incentive is ubiquitous in health care why do we do biohacking stuff like why doesn't health care prevent diseases because there's no [ __ ] money in preventing diseases there's a lot of money in treating them there's no there's not that much in curing them but there's a lot in treating them forever so what is gonna get researched when the money goes in has to have ROI back out of the capitalist system so the fact that people are recognizing that in questioning is a very good thing now the fact they try to find other things that didn't work as the answer is just a basic basically hopelessness and a lack of knowing how to go about solving something so [ __ ] hard so one of the core foe of my life is what is the macroeconomy of the future what are the governance system sort of the civilization systems they can allow us to actually human together well without needing to go to war and unknowable use of resource and producing a bit with this mental and physical illness that's unnecessary and etc and it's not any system that has ever happened so we can get into that if you want to or we can go to other directions but also most of the young people who say communism what they're really saying is Denmark looks better than here like that's a social kind of dynamic where better access to medicine don't have a lot of homeless people masters to PhD is average level of education largely secular because of that like the Nordic countries just look better they are they're just [ __ ] better there's more socialized dynamics now are they better on every metric no if you look here we have a tremendous amount of innovation here because of certain types of freedoms and a tremendous amount of damage and our bell curve is very spread out and so for everyone who's not winning at the system to say nobody is losing as bad in Denmark as they are here and there's a lot less of them and they're not ruining the environment as fast they're actually figuring their trash problem out maybe let's actually think about this and I'm actually not proposing Denmark as a solution I am saying there are a lot of things that are actually evidentially better on meaningful metrics and things that are adequate to the scope of what do we do with almost 8 billion people and distributed exponential technology don't yet exist." - [Daniel

> "I think that most dominant narratives politically right politically left whatever apolitical I think they're they were also influenced by the narrative warfare landscape of what do I need to do to get people to believe this to advance our agenda including where it's not fully true or where it's more provocative or where it's straw man's the other side or where it appeals to people's unmet needs and emotions in ways we know aren't fully true or whatever I don't think that there are any dominant narratives on anything that are not mostly narrative warfare either side of climate change either side of capitalism vaccines whatever like I think most of the topics end up having people in Institute's that have something to gain from lots of people believe in a certain thing figuring out how to tell compelling versions of that they get people to defect on their own sense making to be part of an in-group arrayed against and held together against an out-group and so the kind of good new onst thinking that would be needed to figure out complex things i see almost nowhere and I think what Jordan was referencing is game B which could very easily be another version of that so who it used to be the Pope and then it was you know university professor or whatever who's the authority that knows what's true and has the monopoly on legitimate Authority who can tell everyone else is less smart and informed than them what true and right is to be able to control them basically the moment that legitimate Authority seems to exist there's an orientation of anyone who wants power to capture it and so then of course the sides that want whoever captures it once they continue to double down on it being legitimate Authority and whoever wants to fight who capped it wants to be based at its fake news or it's a false narrative or whatever right I think that the idea of most people not doing in-depth sense making themselves and looking to see which of the Talking Heads they align with and which of the groups they can be part of the in-group on and defect on their own personal responsibility and sense making to be part of groupthink is the failure mode of game a and so it doesn't matter what narrative that's not the thing we want to do if there isn't a plant the flag you get everyone to rally as a war around the new flag there's a how do we get people to actually make sense of the world better in a more thoughtful earnest nuanced way how do we get them to check their own biases better how do we get them to not be susceptible to groupthink better how do we get them to have more courage to express what they actually feel and believe in the presence of a group that is trying to groupthink everyone into it and then how do we get higher qualities of civil conversation where the people are oriented to dialectic rather than war and defection I think what we're seeking is how do we have collective intelligence that is really collective intelligence rather than kind of dumb mobs captured by leaders that want to be leaders." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/mm9AE-oHlPk?t=6035)

> "What is consciousness introspectively it's second order perception I perceive myself perceiving something it creates a bubble of nness the subjective now is not static it's Dynamic it's moving right it's for me something like about 3 seconds long it's the region in space and time where I can basically fit the curve to my sensory data functionally it's an operator that takes mental States and translates them into different mental States and while doing this increases coherence in my mental representations coherence something that we can understand as minimizing violations of constraints in a dynamic model and Consciousness is in some sense colonizing my mental representations making them more and more coherent in a organization that allows every part of my mind to talk all the other parts of my mind that are connected in this bubble I cannot perceive anything that is not coherent using my consciousness and Consciousness plays the role of a conductor of a mental Orchestra if you imagine all the functions that your brain is Computing as instruments and an orchestra and the neighboring instruments are listening to each other and pass on but the instrument next to them is playing you can basically model how the processing streams in your brain b and in this metaphor the conductor is an instrument it doesn't have superpowers it's just an instrument that is tasked with creating coherence so it's singling out a few instruments at a time listens whether they're disharmonic and then it increases the harmony between them and by doing so it makes sure that everybody is on the same page and the entire Orchestra becomes one single coherent entity that is driven by a single motive these perspectives something that is found in a number of theories in philosophy and Neuroscience for instance in vanard Bar's Global workspace theory that is being pursued in Neuroscience by Stan deim the idea of the cartisian theater that how danet calls it the attention schema Theory by graciano the relationship between self model and Consciousness as exemplified in works by metzinger and the Consciousness PR Geor abio calls this a function that basically parameterizing your metal representations to make them dynamically tracking your sensor fre data using little energy and it's also something that is found in many Buddhist perspectives what is consciousness not Consciousness is not intelligence intelligence is the ability to make models and it's also not the same thing as sentience I use the word sentience to mean the ability to recognize yourself and your relationship to the world and it's not agency which is the ability to control your future it's not the self the self is a first person model of your agency and it's not empathy empathy is the ability to experience mental states of other agents arguably you might need Consciousness for that our scientific perspective has some difficulties to deal with the problem of Consciousness that's because it has gaps and its ontology and it comes to describing the difference between psychological objects and physical objects different cultures use different terminology to describe physical and psychological reality and it makes it very hard to translate ideas from Buddhism or from Japanese animism or from Scandinavian mythology into our own culture it even makes it very difficult to translate folk descriptions or theological descriptions into the scientific World in order to make such translations we need something like a meta metaphysic something that allows us to look at all the different metaphysics of these systems from the outside so we can relate them to each other and the main confusion in our own culture concerns the fact that Consciousness is not physical and that you cannot experience physical objects Consciousness is virtual which means it's a software it exists as if software doesn't have an identity it's not a physical thing it's a pattern that you perceive in something it's a causal structure that you use to explain a part of reality physically they're just activation patterns between the neurons the individual neurons cannot experience anything but it would be very useful for a bunch of neurons to know what it would be like if there was a person that cared so they create a simulacrum of that person and virtual entity that experiences itself in a virtual reality generated by your brain and all experiential objects are representations in that virtual reality interpreted from the perspective of yourself and this personal self is also a representation and it can be deconstructed our perception of reality is a trance when you wake up from that trans when you enter a Enlightenment State you basically perceive everything as representations you know that everything is a representation nothing will feel real anymore." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=604)
