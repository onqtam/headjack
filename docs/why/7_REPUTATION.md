- compartmentalization
Fungibility is a loss of information - good for some things (reduces friction, single metric to optimize, etc.), bad for others.
Compartmentalizing expertise
We need compartmentalization of expertise - making it impossible to move value without the loss of information (which the fungibility of money enables)
The commitment of time and attention to problem-solving should be informationally separated from the influence of money which is perfectly fungible

> "Executives know the importance of their companies’ reputations. Firms with strong positive reputations attract better people. They are perceived as providing more value, which often allows them to charge a premium. Their customers are more loyal and buy broader ranges of products and services. Because the market believes that such companies will deliver sustained earnings and future growth, they have higher price-earnings multiples and market values and lower costs of capital. Moreover, in an economy where 70% to 80% of market value comes from hard-to-assess intangible assets such as brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill, organizations are especially vulnerable to anything that damages their reputations." - [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks)

> "Reputation is a matter of perception. A company’s overall reputation is a function of its reputation among its various stakeholders (investors, customers, suppliers, employees, regulators, politicians, nongovernmental organizations, the communities in which the firm operates) in specific categories (product quality, corporate governance, employee relations, customer service, intellectual capital, financial performance, handling of environmental and social issues). A strong positive reputation among stakeholders across multiple categories will result in a strong positive reputation for the company overall." - [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks)

There is no accountability without accounting. In business and finance accounting is about money. In the status, purpose, and meaning world accounting is calculated reputation.

Run PageRank on the data => EventRank!

PageRank is the wisdom of crowds
PageRank is a republic - not a perfect democracy. (Todo: what is a republic) - pages have different influence on other pages

PageRank for accountable and competent individuals is the human alignment problem

Define arbitrary status models - different pagerank algorithms for identities, concepts & events!
the results of one page ranking model can be fed into another - layering/wiring complex models
Google's page rank algorithm simply counts the number of inbound links to a page. It's surely evolved to include other heuristics and some notion of reputation, but pales in comparison to the ranking flexibility and power of an open-ended system built around identity and reputation.

> "Why do people want to improve their reputation? Well, our main evolutionary goals in life are survival and reproduction. Having a good reputation is what makes those goals possible — it’s what makes people want to work with you, take care of you, and partner with you.
>
> But how do status and reputation work? Think about it like this: imagine we all have a number floating above our heads — that's our status score. We can't see it, but we have a sense for where we rank — dating apps even go so far as to quantify it. Over time we learn to perceive both our own score and that of others.
>
> We’re so attune to our status score that we’re laser focused on increasing it even at the expense of seeing objective reality, or truth. As Don Hoffman writes in “The Case Against Reality” “An organism that sees reality as it truly is is never more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality and is just attuned to fitness payoffs” Or as Don says elsewhere: “Optimizing for truth can make you extinct.”
>
> It’s not that we’ll see objective reality (or truth) and consciously ignore it—our brains won’t even filter for it in the first place. In other words, the first thing we see isn’t whether something is true or not, and then decide whether it’s good for us. We do the opposite: We first filter for what’s good for us, and then filter for truth—this explains why we feel emotions first, and then rationalize them after.
>
> To be sure, this doesn’t mean objective reality doesn’t exist. It means we often don’t perceive reality accurately because it’s not aligned with our interest. We think people are rational, but if anything, recent scientific discoveries tell us most of human rationality is not used to make decisions, but rather to come up with arguments to rationalize decisions the subconscious brain has already made." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=Why%20do%20people,has%20already%20made.)

> "The best deceiver is the person who doesn’t even know they’re deceiving. If you truly believe your lie, you won’t betray it. So not only are there selection pressures to deceive others, but also to deceive yourself. The more you deceive yourself, the better you can deceive—or convince—others of the same narrative. The best salespeople are the most fervent believers, those with no traces of doubt." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=the%20best%20deceiver,traces%20of%20doubt.)

> "What does the prioritization of the status score over objective reality imply? That people who want social status will believe and say whatever is convenient, no matter how crazy. Indeed, it’s more predictive to think of “belief” not as something someone thinks of as true, but as something someone thinks will improve their reputation. Want more evidence people don’t prioritize objective truth? You may have noticed that after centuries of the scientific method, people still believe in things like Astrology.
>
> And that’s exactly why the precise content of any ideological point doesn't matter. Brains don’t care about ideology. They didn’t evolve to care about abstract concepts. Indeed: Many people are hypocrites with regard to their overt ideological claims if they can get away with it. Rich elites talk about Global Warming while living in lavish mansions and flying private. Rich parents talk about the importance of public schools while they put their kids in fancy private schools. Cognitive dissonance? No; those cognitive systems are not connected to begin with." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=What%20does%20the,to%20begin%20with.)

> "This is why people aren’t open to changing their minds — because there's no reason they should be. Ideas aren’t about logic, they’re about loyalty. Ideas are Schelling points for tribes. If saying certain things means you’ll make more friends, well, you’re probably going to say those things. That’s the purpose of ideas — to make better friends.
>
> This is also why arguments are often useless, and only cause people to dig into their pre-existing positions. All this stuff about steel-manning other arguments to find truth—it may catalyze scientific progress, but in most social circles, it’s also a surefire way to lose friends and alienate people. (Which is why people who do so are heroes, and why communities who encourage it are foundational for progress).
>
> Indeed: Understanding how the outgroup thinks is frowned upon. You’re not supposed to try to understand what’s going on. You’re supposed to not get it and loudly condemn it. We think of this blind allegiance as harmful behavior, but it actually signals and induces loyalty to one’s in-group." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20people,to%20one%E2%80%99s%20in%2Dgroup.)

> "So then why do we care so much about politics? What's the point of ideology? Ideology is the water you swim in. It’s a structured database of excuses, used to signal your allegiance or defection to the existing ruling coalition. This is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. Different ideas suit different people at different times. Ideas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas. Which is why the culture war is so existential — because the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit. They don’t really care where they get it; they only care that it’s good.
>
> So what determines what people say? It seems clear that the default mode of thinking for humans is groupthink, and the content of that groupthink is computed with a complex algorithm taking into account one's peer group, the loyalties one owes and to whom, who has more status and what talking points fit better with the religion that one has been dutifully drilled into since kindergarten." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes#:~:text=So%20then%20why,into%20since%20kindergarten.)

> "Remember Snapchat's original Best Friends list? I'm going to guess many of my readers don't, because, as noted earlier, old people probably didn't play that status game, if they'd even figured out how to use Snapchat by that point. This was just about as pure a status game feature as could be engineered for teens. Not only did it show the top three people you Snapped with most frequently, you could look at who the top three best friends were for any of your contacts. Essentially, it made the hierarchy of everyone's “friendships” public, making the popularity scoreboard explicit.
>
> As with aggregate follower counts and likes, the Best Friends list was a mechanism for people to accumulate a very specific form of social capital. From a platform perspective, however, there's a big problem with this feature: each user could only have one best friend. It put an artificial ceiling on the amount of social capital one could compete for and accumulate.
>
> In a clever move to unbound social capital accumulation and to turn a zero-sum game into a positive sum game, broadening the number of users working hard or engaging, Snapchat deprecated the very popular Best Friends list and replaced it with streaks.
>
> If you and a friend Snap back and forth for consecutive days, you build up a streak which is tracked in your friends list. Young people quickly threw their heart and souls into building and maintaining streaks with their friends. This was literally proof of work as proof of friendship, quantified and tracked.
>
> Streaks, of course, have the wonderful quality of being unbounded. You can maintain as many streaks as you like. If you don't think social capital has value, you've never seen, as I have, a young person sobbing over having to go on vacation without their phone, or to somewhere without cell or wifi access, only to see all their streaks broken. Some kids have resorted, when forced to go abroad on a vacation, to leaving their phone with a friend who helps to keep all the streaks alive, like some sort of social capital babysitter or surrogate.
>
> What's hilarious is how efficiently young people maintain streaks. It's a daily ritual that often consists of just quickly running down your friend list and snapping something random, anything, just to increment the streak count. My nephew often didn’t even bother framing the camera up, most his streak-maintenance snaps were blurry pics of the side of his elbow, half his shoulder, things like that.
>
> Of course, as evidence of the fragility of social capital structures, streaks have started to lose heat. Many younger users of Snapchat no longer bother with them. Maintaining social capital games is always going to be a volatile game, prone to sudden and massive deflationary events, but while they work, they’re a hell of a drug. They also can be useful; for someone Snapping frequently, like all teens do, having a best friends list sorted to the top of your distribution list is a huge time-saver.

So we pretend we don’t care about status, as a way of gaining status. It’s kind of confusing.
>
> That means status games—i.e., the mutually-agreed-upon rules for winning and losing status—are fragile. We can only play a status game if we lack awareness that it’s status game. As soon as we become aware of the game we’re playing, we stop getting status for playing it. In fact, we lose status: we look selfish, insecure, and low-status. Ew. So virtue signalers cannot know they’re virtue signaling, and neither can the people who award them virtue. “Brave” truth-tellers cannot know they’re seeking praise from their political tribe, and neither can the tribe who praises them. “Rebellious” nonconformists cannot know they’re conforming to the norms of their subculture, and neither can their subculture. Status games must never be emblazoned with a neon sign that says “STATUS GAME”, or else they’ll disintegrate in the light like vampires. We have to play our status games in the dark.
>
> So what happens when the lights come on? The game collapses. People stop playing, for fear of looking uncool. Instead, they start playing an anti-status game to show how cool and not-interested-in-status they are. The point of an anti-status game is to show that you care about more important things than status, like integrity or authenticity or something. Anti-status games emerge in opposition to a collapsing status game, and they often take the opposite form. If people are showing off their immaculately coifed hair, for example, anti-status-seekers might wear their hair artfully tussled.
>
> In other words, anti-status games are just another kind of status game. We could remove the “anti” if we wanted to, but it’s useful to keep it there to get a handle on what’s going on, so we can see why these games are so weird. Status games are constantly collapsing and re-emerging in antithetical forms. They give rise to anti-status games, then anti-anti-status games, and so on. Different cultures split off as status symbols twirl in fractal, quasi-cyclical patterns." - [Status Is Weird, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/status-is-weird#:~:text=We%20all%20want,quasi%2Dcyclical%20patterns.)

> "But is it possible to evaluate our status games from a more rational, dispassionate perspective? Can we somehow learn to defend the status games that actually make the world better and attack the ones that actually make the world worse? Is our sorry species even remotely capable of such a project?
>
> Maybe? Possibly? If there’s any way to pull it off, it’s by appealing to young people, or people having a midlife crisis, or people who haven’t yet won too many status points in any particular game, or who don’t yet know which game they’re most likely to win. Maybe if we urge these on-the-fence people to think a little harder about which status game to play, we can gradually, as a species, move toward status games that make us all better off.

This isn’t true of all our desires (sometimes, we’re just thirsty and want a glass of water), but it’s true of a large percentage of them—dare I say most of them. The majority of our time and energy is consumed by small-minded social competition, and we really hate to admit this. Our need to cover it up is, perhaps, the greatest source of human bullshit.

> Why are our desires secretly like this? Because natural selection, the thing that made our desires, is an icky, competitive process. Animals compete with members of their species for genetic representation in future generations. They do this by competing for physical stuff (like food and territory), social stuff (like friends and mates), and the capacity to get social and physical stuff (like status and power). The competition rages over thousands of generations, and the winners leave more descendants than the losers.

In all likelihood, by motivating them to do that.

The Hawthorne effect is a type of human behavior reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect

What's the loss function of the media landscape? What if we quantified it? How do we incentivise error correction?

when someone does bad in terms of competence/accountability, in addition to a reputational penalty to them we could also penalize a bit those that gave their votes to that person - for empowering a rotten apple. We could also give rewards for delegating to the right person...?

if you see something that you think obviously has an agenda by the media - have a way to express it. Let's see in aggregate who thinks something is politically motivated and who is supporting it. slander needs to be on the record too because if it turns out false - there should be consequences to whoever wrote it

Pointing to the truth is a Schelling point - that's why sunlight is the best disinfectant - if we create the tools for people to elevate competency & sensemake - we win. That's the singularity - we are the most underutilized general intelligence

In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways.

Meritocracy can be computable and open-source
Meritocracy is the last revolution to be had
Meritocracy is true alignment and a prerequisite for consciousness
Meritocracy is a beautiful concept - the current implementation is what sucks


One big problem with meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy is that we've been unable to compute the reputation objectively for accountability. They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability. Proxies such as accreditation have proven bad.
Another criticism is one of lack of diversity and the superior results of the wisdom of crowds. But we can design a meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy however we like in order to maximize the collective intelligence of as many people as possible - it doesn't have to be a small clique of people that make all the contributions.
Also we can separate decision making from values & overall direction & goals so that we all get an equal vote for the values & direction.

> "A meritocracy (in theory) is where we judge people on the basis of their individual abilities rather than their position in the social hierarchy or their family connections. For most of human history, we have not lived in anything resembling a meritocracy. Until recently, the most important institution in society was the family. You inherited your position and defined your identity as a member of a family. As a result, society was much more static than it is now. Social mobility was low, and all that mattered was who you knew. You didn’t get jobs on merit – they were regarded as things that people owned and could pass down to their children. What meritocracy did was create a new kind of aristocracy. The only alternative to the aristocracy of land and inheritance was to replace it with an aristocracy of virtue and talent." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=A%20meritocracy%20(in,virtue%20and%20talent.)

Which leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the "best" & who "earns" it. In one sense it’s a fair process in that, in a successful meritocracy, whoever’s the best, should get it. But in another sense it’s unfair in that people didn’t get the same chance. Because of biological or cultural factors, or just sheer luck, not everyone had the same starting line. And this is the fatal flaw of the term meritocracy — it is about who wins the race but, in its quest to be fair, implies there’s an equal starting line." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=it%20was%20always,equal%20starting%20line.)

It’s being honest about what you truly think while engaging with deep humility and the intent to learn, and in doing so increasing the probability of the team succeeding. Every member of the community has a responsibility to be honest and direct, and we expect a constant flow of feedback in all directions. It is most critical that feedback flow from those with less power to those with more, not because those with less power should bear the greatest burden, but because there are relatively more challenges to feedback moving in that direction — everything from power dynamics to frequency of interaction. In line with that everyone, but most especially leaders, has a responsibility not just to solicit honesty from others, but to assess whether that’s actually happening across all levels and if not, to diagnose why." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20more%20unsure,to%20diagnose%20why.)

- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people. So if you think government is for that purpose, and I do, then you have to wonder if we should pick the form of government that best delivers the goods, whatever that might be." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20to,that%20might%20be.)

But, as Brennan reports, the mathematical models that have been proposed work only if voter ignorance has no shape of its own—if, for example, voters err on the side of liberalism as often as they err on the side of conservatism, leaving decisions in the hands of a politically knowledgeable minority in the center.

By accepting that (and studying why) people are different, we can achieve a proper balance between social mobility and hierarchy, between nature and nurture, between what we can change and what we can’t — and deploy our dollars and set our expectations accordingly.

> "Back in the day there was no police force, no judiciary, and no prison system. Gossip was how we regulated our societies for thousands of years. After all, people needed to know who to collaborate with and who to avoid. But once we settled down and our communities started growing big enough that we couldn't know every member personally, gossip stopped working as a method of adjudicating and regulating the behavior of the tribe. So we invented a new accountability mechanism: an all-seeing, all-knowing God that could either reward and punish us. And once we stopped believing in god, the media took over god’s role. More recently, social media has become the newest accountability enforcer — and it’s a [disaster](https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1507497409441632262?lang=en)." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=back%20in%20the,a%20disaster.)

Previously, our envy was limited to 150 people. But now we’re constantly comparing ourselves to 8 billion people. Take any skill we might have — we can now easily find someone orders of magnitude better at it. Social media has put people in a 24/7 global status competition hamster wheel and most people can't keep up. There are more ways to gain status, recognition and community than ever before — but there are also more ways than ever to remind ourselves how many people are better, richer, and happier than we are." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=Our%20brains%20evolved,than%20we%20are.)

> "There are two prestige games we play within tribes in order to increase our status: virtue games and competence games. Virtue games are about enforcing the norms of the group. Competence games are about being useful to the group. Before settling in tribes, we used to primarily play dominance games — but prestige games (i.e. virtue, competence) took over once we began to collaborate with other tribes.
>
> In some ways, the industrial revolution cemented the prioritization of competence games over virtue games. We started caring much less about caste and social background, and caring much more about who can build the best bridge or the best internal combustion engine, etc. This meant that status became much more “liquid,” meaning you could rise or fall much more often according to your level of competence.
>
> But in other ways, virtue games have reinvented themselves today. They’re played by all the whistleblowers, activists, and cancelers. Some change history — but some just cause problems. Why do they do this? Among other reasons, they get a status boost from it. There are millions and millions of ordinary people with ordinary lives who suddenly feel like they're fighting the good fight against the forces of evil. As humans we have this need to feel like heroes, and modern life grants us very little opportunity to do so. Religion and wars used to serve this purpose. Today, it’s politics and activism.
>
> To be sure, everyone wants status. But not everyone can be competent. That’s hard. Competence takes years of practice, in addition to natural talent and opportunities. But, for better and for worse, nearly anyone can become a victim. Given how much we empathize with victims, we struggle to adjudicate harm and reflexively take the side of the victim, even in circumstances where the harm was exaggerated, partly to counteract how much we’ve failed to defend certain victims historically.
>
> This partly explains cancel culture: a warped amplification of our natural desires to gossip, seek revenge, and accrue status points from taking other people down.

> The irony, however, is that once you assume a lot of status, you’re now suddenly incentivized to hide how much status you have.

> "Remember, our 150-person tribes evolved to be egalitarian by design since resources were limited. Since we’re still wired for that zero sum world, we feel excited when others suffer and angry when they thrive because we unconsciously assume that their thriving is at our expense. This, however, is not the case. It’s actually the opposite — people who thrive often have more to offer us.

> This results in [Tall Poppy Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome), or the idea that you don’t want to stand out too much lest people start to resent you. When Tall Poppy Syndrome pervades a culture, it prevents people from reaching their potential, which is perverse. It also explains why successful people are often so vulnerable — they want others to think that they’re just like them, even though they are in fact better. They often don’t have imposter syndrome, but you’d probably hate them if they said that aloud. Instead they wax poetic about how much they doubt themselves so they appear more relatable. This is also why successful people behave vulnerably in the public eye. Vulnerability makes unsuccessful people feel better by implying that the reason they didn’t make it is because of either bad luck or a biased society. It also implies that even if they had become successful, they’d be miserable anyway, since success breeds misery, or something. Which largely isn’t true, of course.

> Nietzsche named this envy “[Ressentiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment)”. Ayn Rand called it “Hatred of the good for being the good.” In a world where we believe that we can be anything, if we don’t end up the next Elon Musk or Michelle Obama or Kim Kardashian or whoever celebrity we admire, we seek someone to blame. We could blame ourselves, but that would be depressing. It’s easier to blame other people or larger societal injustices. Ressentiment is “a reassignment of the pain of feeling one's own inferiority onto an external scapegoat. The ego creates the illusion of an enemy — a cause that can be "blamed" for one's own failure. Thus, one can consider themself thwarted not by a personal failure, but rather by an external "evil.""

> Without even trying, we convince ourselves we aren’t seeking status, but of course we need it. Without it, we become depressed — even suicidal. Status is how we're wired to measure our worth. Why? We’re wired this way because we originally needed to be part of a tribe in order to survive. If you lost all of your status and were kicked out of your tribe, you died — which is why being “canceled” at the time meant you died, which explains why we dread it so much. People who experience a severe drop in status often become depressed or suicidal.

When things are going badly, I'm going to tell you. And lastly when you’re competent, you’re saying “I'm going to be useful. I've got a skill that’s useful to our game, and I can help you benefit from it and maybe even learn how to do it too.” One can analyze status dynamics in a million ways, but in some ways maybe it’s as simple as being warm, sincere, competent—and loyal." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20very%20difficult,competent%E2%80%94and%20loyal.)

We can only look virtuous by making it look like we weren’t trying to look virtuous. Which means that, to win the virtue game, we have to do all sorts of social maneuvering: we have to send “buried signals” of anonymous or inconspicuous altruism (to get credit for not caring about getting credit), show “modesty” or “humility” (to look morally superior to non-humble people), “bravely” defy social norms (to win the approval of our peers), and display our adherence to ethical principles independent of our self-interest (which is, ultimately, in our self-interest).
