Fungibility is a loss of information - good for some things (reduces friction, single metric to optimize, etc.), bad for others.
Compartmentalizing expertise
We need compartmentalization of expertise - making it impossible to move value without the loss of information (which the fungibility of money enables)
The commitment of time and attention to problem-solving should be informationally separated from the influence of money which is perfectly fungible

# Regulating Prestige Through Awards

> "The practice of giving awards and honors allows an individual, such as a king, or an institution, such as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to regulate status within a society, organization, or industry. Rather than regulating all behavior by all people at all times, an award sets the bar for what is the highest status behavior or achievement and, by virtue of its public nature, allows everyone else to figure out for themselves how they should aspire to behave as well." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "We usually think honors are about the recipient, but the giver of honors also gains. The giver and recipient collaborate to publicly assert that the recipient is worthy of prestige, and that the giver has the authority to grant it. Honors are thus acts of an alliance to mutually boost prestige... The audience also participates in this transaction of prestige. They either accept the whole affair and the implied claims of the giver and the recipient, or reject or ignore them. The honors only have meaning—and thus the primary parties only gain—if the onlookers take them seriously... Honors can be prestigious because prestigious people receive them, because prestigious people give them, or both." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "If one looks closely at any society, one will observe that its rulers—and their prestige—subsidize all other sources of prestige. Thus, when the landscape of power shifts, the landscape of prestige shifts accordingly. It is then critical that rulers are incentivized to allocate prestige well—that is, in accordance with the actual distribution of excellence. If they aren’t, as in the case of Stalin, the resulting distortions in the allocation of prestige produce distortions in their society’s understanding of what is good and what is true. Lysenkoism was an epistemic and moral disaster. This kind of corruption can ultimately have catastrophic effects on the society’s health, because the ability to ascertain the truth is fundamental to the functionality of a society’s people and its institutions." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)
^^ not sure how to use this quote... maybe parts of it?

> "Among the many different kinds of honors, we can pick out two especially common ones: those meant to incentivize a particular achievement with a financial reward, which I call prizes, and those meant to afford prestige on the basis of past achievement, which I call awards. Prizes aim to get some specific thing done, whereas awards aim to affect the distribution of prestige, incentivizing achievement in a more indirect way. With a prize, money is fundamental. With an award, it is incidental. The Millennium Prizes are a prime example of the former, the Academy Awards of the latter.
>
> This distinction is often muddled, leading honors to be less effective than they could be. I have to clarify what I mean by each term, because in practice they aren’t used in a reliable way. There are awards that are called prizes and prizes that are called awards. Despite its name, the Nobel Prize is a hybrid case that is more of an award. Though it comes with a financial reward, it is primarily about affording prestige, and this is what those who try to win it are after. The money is nice, but the glory is better.
>
> It’s for this reason that I think that awards are more effective than prizes in incentivizing the production of knowledge. Glory is a greater motivator than money...
>
> A prize also provides less return on its creator’s investment of social capital than an award. Once the goal is achieved and the prize won, there is no longer a reason for it to exist. It is self-abolishing. An award, on the other hand, can continue to be given out year after year, compounding the investment of prestige." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "The more closely social status corresponds to activity that’s ultimately beneficial for society, the more such activity is incentivized, much more strongly than by even a large financial reward. Wisely distributing status makes the difference between a world where most kids dream of becoming YouTubers and one where they dream of taking us to space." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "Status is one of the irreplaceable currencies whose necessary transfer is often denounced in this way. Michael Sauder et al. define status as the relative respect and patterns of deference accorded to people, groups and organizations by wider society... People cannot engage in any common projects without some commonly agreed-upon deference to people, groups or organizations, nor can they engage in common projects without someone or something holding, and yes, spending status. Status is a coordination mechanism, and this makes it valuable.
>
> If we come together to do great things, much status is required, whether vested in an institution or an individual. That someone will be holding status in this sense, personally or as a representative of an organization, then, is an unavoidable consequence of people coming together to do things. Perhaps one can argue for a dispersed distribution of status as the best way for us to organize such efforts, but the fact is that deference by some towards others on technical and resource distribution questions is still the central guiding factor." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

Moreover, in an economy where 70% to 80% of market value comes from hard-to-assess intangible assets such as brand equity, intellectual capital, and goodwill, organizations are especially vulnerable to anything that damages their reputations." - [Reputation and Its Risks](https://hbr.org/2007/02/reputation-and-its-risks)

Self-esteem is a measure of effectiveness in social relations and interactions that monitors acceptance and/or rejection from others.

> ... The main concept of sociometer theory is that the self-esteem system acts as a gauge to measure the quality of an individual's current and forthcoming relationships. Furthermore, this measurement of self-esteem assesses these two types of relationships in terms of relational appreciation. This is how other people might view and value the relationships they hold with the individual. If relational appreciation of an individual differs negatively, relational devaluation is experienced. Relational devaluation exists in the format of belongingness, with a negative alteration allowing the sociometer gauge to highlight these threats, producing emotional distress to act to regain relational appreciation and restore balance in the individual's self-esteem." - [Sociometer, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociometer)

> "Ultimately, status lives in the minds (and bodies) of all the humans within a given community — by which I mean, primarily, other people's minds and bodies. You might maintain a sense of your own status, but it's not really up to you. Status is fundamentally about how others perceive and interact with you (and what they allow you to get away with). It's like keeping a checkbook — you might maintain your own ledger for planning and making decisions, but the official balance lies with the bank. There are many ways to define status, but as a working definition let's take status to be **"the total amount of social influence a person has over the other members of his or her community."** There's a lot to unpack from this definition. Here are some of the more interesting implications:
>
> • Status is defined with respect to a community. This accords with how we reason about status in the real world. You don't have one canonical status for all occasions. You might have relatively low status in your workplace but high status at your church, with hardly any cognitive dissonance on the part of everyone involved.
>
> • Status is zero-sum (to a first approximation). There's only a fixed amount of influence to go around. Some have squirmed to dodge this conclusion, but let's just bite the bullet and be done with it. If nothing else, this should motivate our discussion of status as an economic good.
>
> • Status is not a positional good. It's sometimes argued (e.g. on Wikipedia) that status doesn't have a cardinal value — only ordinal (rank) values. According to this view, status is synonymous with your relative position on the totem pole — but I don't think this is correct. You can be the highest-status member of your community by a wide or narrow margin, depending on how much influence you have. There are 'distances' involved, not just relative positions. Geert Hofstede's power distance index is an illustration of the cardinal nature of status. Status is a value that summarizes a very high-dimensional quality. The underlying reality is the set of all pairwise influence values (A's influence over B, A's influence over C, etc.). These values can be averaged or summed (which is how we typically think of status), but they also have a variance, a kurtosis, etc. To complicate things even further, we might consider treating status as the weighted sum of all the pairwise influences — weighted (perhaps perversely) by the status of each of the people being influenced. Additionally, some influences aren't pairwise at all — you can have influence over an entire group, even without having much influence over any of the members in isolation. I don't think it changes much of the analysis here, but it's useful to know that we're dealing in approximations.
>
> • Status is (in part) a knowledge problem. Your status is based not just on how people react to you, but also on how people think everyone else will react to you. This gives rise to all manner of higher-order effects: common knowledge issues, perception management, manipulation of consensus reality, etc.
>
> Because of these higher-order effects, status is most reliably measured in public. We tweak our private estimates during every pairwise interaction, but reconcile those estimates during interactions that take place in front of larger audiences — because that's where we can observe the reactions of everyone else. This explains some of our desire to watch speeches, movies, events, etc. in large crowds, despite the convenience of watching from a screen at home. Large crowds can be manipulated, of course, but the very manipulation is itself an honest signal of influence." - [The Economics of Social Status, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-economics-of-social-status/)

## What Governs Status Biologically

maybe just use the first bullet point? and rename this ## section?

> "Here are some of the concepts that govern the day-to-day biology of social status:
>
> • Prestige vs. dominance. Joseph Henrich (of WEIRD fame) distinguishes two types of status. Prestige is the kind of status we get from being an impressive human specimen (think Meryl Streep), and it's governed by our 'approach' instincts. Dominance, on the other hand, is the kind of status we get from being able to intimidate others (think Joseph Stalin), and is governed by fear and other 'avoid' instincts. Of course these two types of status aren't mutually exclusive, but they're analytically distinct strategies with different biological expressions.
>
> • Fitness displays. In The Mating Mind, Geoffrey Miller argues that many of our most prized, socially-desirable qualities — athleticism, artistic skill, eloquence, intelligence, physical beauty — serve as fitness displays, i.e., advertisements for the quality of our genes. We are attracted, socially and sexually, to people with high skill and beauty, largely because these traits are honest signals of good genes.
>
> • Hormones...
>
> • Body language...
>
> ... social status is not arbitrary. Instead, it's grounded, very concretely, in the biology of honest signals — and as such, it's subject to very real constraints. Wild swings of status are possible, but they're mostly the stuff of stories. Our daily lives are governed by much smaller — and more predictable — gains and losses." - [The Economics of Social Status, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-economics-of-social-status/)

## The Economic Properties of Social Status

> "Let's start with transactions, since they form the basis of an economy. Status is part of our system for competing over scarce resources, so it should be no surprise that it participates in so many of our daily transactions. Some examples:
>
> • We trade status for favors (and vice versa). This is so common you might not even realize it, but even the simple act of saying "please" and "thank you" accords a nominal amount of status to the person doing the favor. The fact that status is at stake in these transactions becomes clear when the pleasantries are withheld, which we often interpret as an insult (i.e., a threat to our status).
>
> • An apology is a ritual lowering of one's status to compensate for a (real or perceived) affront. As with gratitude, withholding an apology is perceived as an insult.
>
> • We trade status for information (and vice versa). This is one component of "powertalk," as illustrated in the Gervais Principle series.
>
> • We trade status for sex (and vice versa), which often goes by the name "seduction." Sometimes even the institution of marriage functions as a sex-for-status transaction. Dowries illustrate this principle by working against it — they reinforce class/caste systems by making it harder for high-status men to marry low-status women.
>
> • We reward employees in the form of institutionalized status (titles, promotions, parking spots), which trade off against salary as a form of compensation.
>
> • We can turn money into status by means of conspicuous consumption, or status into money by means of endorsement (i.e., being paid to lend status to an endeavor).
>
> None of these transactions is perfectly clean, and most of them are impossible to audit (arguably a feature rather than a bug, for some transactions). Paying with status is much murkier than paying with dollars, and it's easy to get something other than what you expected. But don't let the uncertainty or the potential for cheating distract you. There are real gains to be had from these kinds of trades — so, as humans always do, we find a way. Our emotions, for example, often tell us when we've been cheated in a status transaction, even if it's hard to articulate exactly how.
>
> In addition to participating in direct, X-for-Y trades like the above, status also functions as collateral or "table stakes." (We often call this type of status "reputation.") In many ways, a favor is like a loan (of time, energy, or some other resource) collateralized by the status of the borrower. It's a weird kind of collateral, since it can't be transfered to the creditor if the borrower defaults. But the borrower's status can be destroyed or ruined, which provides incentive enough for most purposes. The bigger the favor, of course, the more status needs to be put up as collateral. This explains why it's hard for a low-status person to ask a high-status person for a favor, but easy for a high-status person to make the request.
>
> "Bidding for status" is another activity with economic characteristics. The nature of a bid is that it sets a particular 'price' that can be accepted or rejected. Robin Hanson [suspects](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/04/choke-to-submit.html) that speaking in public is a way of bidding for status. The very act of standing in front of a group and speaking authoritatively represents a claim to relatively high status. If you speak on behalf of the group — i.e., making statements that summarize the group's position or commit the group to a course of action — then you're claiming even higher status. These bids can either be accepted by the group (if they show approval or rapt attention, and let you continue to speak) or rejected (if they show disapproval, interrupt you, ignore you, or boo you off stage).
>
> Similarly, every request for a favor is a complex bidding process (i.e. negotiation) framed largely — and often implicitly — in terms of status. When a manager, for example, gives a task to a subordinate, many nuances are involved in negotiating the 'price' of the favor in terms of the subordinate's status:
>
> • Does the manager frame the task as a favor (high status for the subordinate), as a request (medium status), or as a demand (low status)?
>
> • Does the manager lower his or her status when making the request? *Please* and *thank you* are just the two most ritualized ways of doing this; there are many others. Alternately, does the manager attempt to raise the status of the subordinate? E.g. "You'd be really good at this."
>
> • Conditional verbs (*would*, *could*) allude to the subordinate's autonomy (and high status), whereas declarative verbs set an expectation that there will be no negotiating (low status).
>
> • Does the subordinate acquiesce immediately to the request (low status), hint at requiring extra terms (medium status), or outright reject the request (high status)?
>
> ... One-off transactions (like a favor) usually take place within the context of a relationship. Different types of relationships can be viewed as primitive 'contracts.' Friendship, for example, is a contract whose terms specify that the two friends are roughly equal in status (at least within the frame of the relationship) and that they've agreed to dispense with fine-grained accounting of every status transaction... Other types of relationships (manager/subordinate, mentor/mentee, partnerships, client/vendor, etc.) set different terms for how status is to be transacted between the parties..." - [The Economics of Social Status, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-economics-of-social-status/)

<details><summary>Status as Money</summary><p>

> "So far we've been talking about status as a good without trying to articulate its formal economic properties. So now I'd like to propose that status functions as money. We have a few idioms that encode this idea — social capital, political capital, etc. — but the analogy goes a lot deeper than our ordinary use of language permits. In economic terms, for a good to function as money it must serve three related purposes:
>
> 1. A medium of exchange,
>
> 2. A store of value, and
>
> 3. A unit of account.
>
> We've already discussed how status functions as a medium of exchange. Because it's so fluid, it can be used to price favors and other goods at relatively fine resolutions, and it facilitates transactions that wouldn't otherwise be able to occur. Negotiating with status beats the hell out of bartering — i.e., trading one specific good for another — thereby allowing smoother, more efficient economies to develop.
>
> I hope it's also clear that status functions as a store of value. It's not as stable as gold or USD, which hold their value with much less volatility. But status can certainly be accumulated (within a given community) and it doesn't depreciate too quickly.
>
> Whether status functions as a unit of account is much less clear. A unit of account is what allows e.g. a firm to know whether it's operating at a profit or a loss. And this requires, well, an actual unit — something precise and quantifiable, neither of which is status's strong suit. Nor can status be aggregated across individuals. But where it lacks objectivity, it is at least subjectively measurable, i.e., across an individual's life history. At the end of a work day, for example, you'll have a pretty good sense for whether you gained or lost status that day. And at larger time scales (quarters or years), you can have reasonable certainty about whether you're doing better or worse than you expected. This allows status to function as a unit of account for your individual P/L. It certainly helps you make decisions about when to switch roles or jobs or careers, or when to seek out new friends — or just try something different. It also lets you (and others) know when you've gone bankrupt, which is usually accompanied by some kind of formal intervention from the community, up to and including excommunication.
>
> So: status may not be an ideal money, but it's close enough for the metaphor to hold water. (Also encouraging: apparently money and social status are processed in the [same region of the brain](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=for-the-brain-status-is-better).) At any rate, here's what happens when we apply monetary economic concepts to the realm of social status:
>
> **Liquidity**. Status, like other forms of capital, can be more or less liquid. Status liquidity is inversely proportional to how much it is institutionalized. Institutional forms of status include titles, formal roles, positions within a hierarchy, desk/office location, parking spots, and membership in decision-making bodies. These forms of status hold their value much better than reputational status — which is why they're coveted by employees — but they also make some transactions more difficult. If you've ever worked with someone who's not as valuable as his title or role would suggest, you know how frustratingly inefficient such an arrangement can be.
>
> [**Gresham's Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham's_law) states that "bad money drives out good." The classic example is that people will attempt to spend coins suspected of being counterfeit before they spend coins that they know to be honest. Does something similar happen with social status? Emphatically, yes. Within the economy of an office, say, we can distinguish between the 'honest' status earned by doing one's job vs. the 'counterfeit' status earned by carefully manipulating one's image. It's all too easy to reach an equilibrium where counterfeit, image-based status drives out honest, reality-based status. Once an office culture allows its employees to win large amounts of status by 'talking themselves up,' everyone drops what they're doing to focus on seeking credit and avoiding blame. In such an economy, only a sucker does any real work.
>
> **Status inflation**. Inflation is a bit tricky because it requires that value be measured in terms of a specific unit — which can then be debased by 'minting' more of those units. Dollars clearly fit the bill, but we can find inflationary tendencies in almost every explicit measure of status. Companies — and sometimes even entire industries — can experience title inflation, for example. Or top-heaviness, which is basically an 'inflation' of the hierarchy. I don't know of any studies that attempt to measure office inflation, but I wouldn't be surprised to find that as companies age, they tend toward office buildings that have more windows, or just nicer space in general. Even more cynically, I wonder if the practice of hiring interns is driven (in part) by the same incentives that lead to other forms of hierarchy inflation."
>
> **Status arbitrage**. I'm not sure if the analogy is perfect, but the word arbitrate suggests a parallel between status mediation and financial arbitrage. If you play the role of mediator in a community, you can earn status by brokering conflicts. A conflict usually arises when two parties disagree about their relative statuses, i.e., when there's a price discrepancy. Since any successful resolution will involve a re-pricing, it might be possible to view mediation in terms of siphoning off some of the status that needs to be exchanged in order to successfully resolve the conflict.
>
> **Currency blocs**. Previously we defined status with respect to a community, but we could also flip it around: *"A community is a group of people who agree on how to measure status among their members."* In other words, it's a group of people who share a common status currency. Silicon Valley, for example, is a community oriented around a particular way of measuring status — the ability to influence the growth of engineering companies. But Silicon-Valley status won't buy you anything in Hollywood — unless you convert it to something that makes sense in the Hollywood economy. (Financial wealth usually does the trick).
>
> This definition allows us not only to draw boundaries between communities (porous and fuzzy though they may be), but also allows us to discuss the strength of a community, i.e., the level of agreement about how to measure status. Google, for example, is a fairly strong community insofar as Googlers agree on how to measure status among themselves, but Google engineering might be an even stronger community.
>
> Treating communities as "status-currency blocs" helps explain how there's relatively free trade (at low transaction costs) within the community — and also how trade is distorted across community boundaries. The fluctuating 'exchange rates' and asymmetric information make cross-community interaction more difficult. When a Google VP walks into a meeting with some employees from Facebook, say, everyone will be unsure about their relative statuses, and the group will have to spend time and effort (and a lot of posturing) in order to figure it out.
>
> The "currency bloc" metaphor also helps explain both the benefits and the costs of institutional re-orgs. Merging two organizations, for example, can increase economic efficiency (by standardizing on a single status currency and thereby facilitating more interaction/trade), but the integration will also require some 'repricing' — with resistance from everyone who loses out. - [The Economics of Social Status, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-economics-of-social-status/)

<details><summary>Status as Economic Efficiency</summary><p>

> "If status acts as a medium of exchange, then one of the most important questions we can ask is how it contributes to economic efficiency.
>
> ... Let's define a culture's use of status as efficient if status transactions tend to advance the goals of the community. An efficient culture, then, is first and foremost a meritocracy. Status will be awarded for skills and contributions that advance shared goals — making a big sale, meeting an important deadline, etc. And status will not be awarded for things that are orthogonal to (or detract from) the goals of the community. These include: nepotism, flattery and ass-kissing, race/gender/age, and humor/beauty/external status (unless they're important for getting the job done). And seniority should correlate with 'substantive contributions'; no one should be rewarded just for warming a chair.
>
> But how status is awarded is only half of the equation; we also have to ask how status is spent. Do people use their status to pursue shared goals, or rather to advance their own, competing agendas? Executives who abuse the corporate credit card, get off on harassing their employees, or engage in certain types of empire-building, for example, are contributing to an inefficient culture.
>
> Dominance status is an especially tricky proposition. There's a niche for dominance in human societies, so trying to get by without it is an unstable arrangement. And it's necessary for keeping people in line. But there's also a real potential for abuse. People often use dominance to reinforce their status in ways that don't advance shared goals. And in addition to being potentially inefficient, dominance also has the effect of silencing criticism. Criticism is always a threat to one's status, but unless your goal is to maintain your own status at all costs, you need criticism to stay on the right track. No one makes perfect decisions at all times, and not everyone promoted into a position of leadership is good for the organization.
>
> There are many, many nuances to attend to here — all of them important to maintaining an efficient culture. But in the interest of space, I'd like to call attention to two disease states in particular:
>
> **Gossip**. Some gossip is necessary for moving information around, but often it's used to lower someone's status behind his or her back. This is especially pernicious. Because gossip can't be confronted outright, it leads to an equilibrium where everyone needs to spread rumors and participate in the gossip mill just to maintain their position. Sticking to the economic metaphors, gossip is like a black market for shorting other people's status in exchange for elevating your own (among your gossiping partners). Bridgewater — the world's largest hedge fund and, I would argue, an extremely efficient culture — elevates gossip to the level of [capital offense](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jul/05/office-banned-gossip).
>
> **Politics**. It's hard, perhaps even impossible, to provide a neutral account of what constitutes 'political' behavior in an office, but here goes: Politics is any attempt to win status through actions that don't advance the goals of the community. The economic analogue here is rent-seeking — vying for a larger share of the pie in ways that don't increase the overall size of the pie. Rentseeking behaviors in a status economy include: competing for access to highstatus individuals, hoarding resources that could be put to better use, acting as an information broker (requiring payment instead of giving information freely), and (as we've seen) manipulating one's image instead of attending to reality. Efforts spent on politics/rent-seeking represent [deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss) in an office economy." - [The Economics of Social Status, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-economics-of-social-status/)

# Social Status: Down the Rabbit Hole

> "Social status among humans actually comes in two flavors: dominance and prestige. Dominance is the kind of status we get from being able to intimidate others (think Joseph Stalin), and on the low-status side is governed by fear and other avoidance instincts. Prestige, however, is the kind of status we get from being an impressive human specimen (think Meryl Streep), and it’s governed by admiration and other approach instincts." - [The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9425294-social-status-among-humans-actually-comes-in-two-flavors-dominance)

Dominance vs. prestige, and what prestige is good for:

> "DOMINANCE VS. PRESTIGE
>
> The beginning of wisdom about social status is learning to distinguish its two (and only two) primary forms: dominance and prestige. These are, as [one research paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.368.3973&rep=rep1&type=pdf) puts it, the *"two ways to the top."* If dominance is the kind of status we get from intimidating others, prestige is the kind of status we get from doing impressive things or having impressive traits or skills.
>
> A schoolyard bully is an example of pure dominance. He's not impressive, only aggressive. Stephen Hawking and Malala Yousafzai (winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize), on the other hand, are examples of pure prestige. You're likely to treat them with deference and respect, though neither is threatening to stuff you in a locker. Both forms of status can, of course, exist simultaneously in the same person — e.g., Steve Jobs, who was brilliant, charismatic, and a notorious tyrant to his employees. The point is that dominance and prestige can be separated, and that they're analytically distinct. They're the two Platonic forms of social status.
>
> It might help to think of these as different systems, each of which can be broken down into a high-status component and a low-status component. So Dominance & Submission are one complementary pair (of interlocking instincts, emotions, and behaviors), while Prestige & Admiration are a different complementary pair... You can also think of these as two different relationships: one between a dominant and a submissive, the other between a prestigious individual and an admirer. The dominance system and the prestige system have at least one thing in common: There are perks to having high status (whichever form it takes). Other than that, the two systems are almost complete opposites:
>
> • **Avoidance vs. approach**. Dominance works by inspiring fear and other "avoidance" instincts, so that low-status people try to steer clear of dominant individuals. Prestige, on the other hand, inspires admiration and other "approach" instincts, so low-status people actively seek out prestigious individuals and enjoy spending time around them.
>
> • **Taking vs. giving**. The perks of dominance are taken by force by the high-status (dominant) individual. The perks of prestige, on the other hand, are given to the high-status (prestigious) individual, freely, by the low-status admirer.
>
> • **Entitlement vs. gratitude**. Dominant individuals expect deference from others and treat it as their natural right. Prestigious individuals, on the other hand, often make an elaborate show of humility when accepting the deference of others. Performers bow as they're being applauded. Oscar-winners profusely thank their supporters. Lay people often blush and smile awkwardly when they're being celebrated, e.g., at a birthday party. To do otherwise — to act entitled to admiration — would risk alienating one's supporters.
>
> ... THE EVOLUTION OF PRESTIGE
>
> ... Unfortunately, the logic of prestige isn't nearly as simple and straightforward as the logic of dominance. In fact it's a bit tangled, and if we aren't careful, we're liable to miss the whole point. With that in mind, what follows is the most important thing I hope you'll take away from this essay: *"To understand dominance, we need to focus on the high-status behaviors. To understand prestige, however, we need to focus on the low-status behaviors."*
>
> ... Consider the two instincts/behaviors that make up the prestige system. On the high-status side, we have **prestige-seeking**: striving to impress others. On the low-status side, we have **admiration**: celebrating or fawning over a prestigious individual, i.e., paying respect. Note what we mean by "admiration" here is more than just passive respect from a distance. It requires active deference to the prestigious individual: giving them your seat, buying them drinks, offering to set them up with your brother or sister, etc.
>
> Now which of these two behaviors — prestige-seeking or admiration — is primary? Put another way: which of the two behaviors makes sense on its own, without the other? Well, as Will Rogers said, *"We can't all be heroes because somebody has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by."* In other words, there's no point in seeking prestige unless others are ready and willing to celebrate you for it; prestige literally means nothing without admiration. On the other hand, it does make sense to admire impressive people, even if they aren't actively seeking it.
>
> So admiration, rather than prestige-seeking, is the lynchpin of the prestige system. The central question we need to answer, then, is why people freely admire (defer and give respect to) prestigious individuals. In other words, *What's in it for the admirer?*
>
> ... ADMIRATION ACCORDING TO HENRICH
>
> Henrich and Gil-White begin with the observation that low-status admirers are attracted to their prestigious superiors and hope to spend more time around them, and that their admiration therefore acts as a bribe. Admirers, in other words, are sycophants... They pay respect to a prestigious individual in order to cultivate access to him. They may bring him gifts (large or small), run errands for him, support him in conflicts, defer to him in mating scenarios, or all of the above. Or they may simply flatter him and sing his praises to other members of the group. These, as we've seen, are the perks of high prestige. But, again, what's in it for the admirer? Here Henrich and Gil-White hypothesize that admirers are hoping to learn from their superiors... since humans learn mostly by observation and imitation, they need to spend time, up close, observing the skills and behaviors they wish to copy. This account harkens to the relationship between master and apprentice...
>
> ... PRESTIGE IN HUMANS
>
> ... Once you know how to look for prestige — and, just as important, to stop conflating it with dominance — you'll find it everywhere... The point is, we want to be friends, allies, and teammates with people who do good things for their friends, allies, and teammates. It's in our self-interest to cultivate access to such people — which we do, in part, by paying them respect and granting them the perks of prestige.
>
> More generally, however, we admire not only those who actually do good things for their teammates, but also those who show the potential to do good things, i.e., by demonstrating useful skills. The student who gets straight As from a good college, for example, is advertising her value to future employers, and her prestige makes her highly sought-after on the job market. She'll be actively courted by hiring managers and given various perks (a better starting salary, more time to make her decision) that aren't accorded to her less-impressive classmates.
>
> As always, Pinker offers a crisp definition. Prestige status, he says, is "the public knowledge that you possess assets that would allow you to help others if you wished to." In other words, prestige reflects your value as a teammate, whether actual or potential.
>
> This account of prestige explains all of the puzzles that Henrich's account (learning-by-imitation) has trouble with. It explains why we admire and defer (to some extent) even to people with skills strictly inferior to our own — like the hiring manager courting the straight-A student. It explains why we admire others even when we aren't trying to learn from them — i.e., because we want them on our team. And finally, it explains why we admire others even for skills that can't be taught or learned. It pays to be friends with strong, beautiful people, for example, even if those traits are unlikely to rub off on us.
>
> Admiration and prestige-seeking, then, are teaming instincts... Both are ways of currying favor among actual or potential allies. The admirer tries to ingratiate himself with a specific individual, whereas the prestige-seeker tries to make himself attractive to a larger, wider audience. But both are ultimately after the same thing: more spoils from cooperative (team) efforts.
>
> This is it. This is the magic, the special sauce — the juice that fuels the engine of cooperation. The Golden Rule of ethics says, *"Do unto others as you would have done unto you."* But the Golden Rule of politics, which has arguably created more prosperity for our species, goes something like this: *"Admire those who would make good allies."*
>
> Unlike the ethical rule, which has to be hammered into us (because it cuts slightly against the grain of our nature), the political rule comes to us quite naturally. It's deeply embedded in our instincts, and we follow it, without effort, because it's to our advantage to admire potential teammates, especially when they're impressive or likely to be helpful. We're sycophants, one and all — and (for those of you trying to keep score) that's a very good thing.
>
> As Scott Adams [recently wrote](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/130880041216/narcissistic-accuser-syndrome): *"I'm a big fan of being admired, assuming I did something worthy. I find the goodwill of others to be one of several sources of personal motivation, and a legitimate one. Am I allowed to make the world a better place and enjoy the fact that others appreciate the effort? That seems like a reasonable deal for everyone. If you do something good for the world, I promise to admire you, and I hope you enjoy the feeling. Maybe it will encourage you to do more good stuff."*" - [Social Status: Down the Rabbit Hole, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/)

> "Perhaps most provocatively, Dessalles' thesis is that talking — voluntarily offering information to others — is ultimately incentivized by prestige status. Even something as simple as pointing (declaratively) requires prestige status to get off the ground. We talk (and evolved to do so) in order to advertise to others our ability to produce relevant insight on demand, which makes us good allies for cooperative endeavors." - [Social Status Follow-up Thoughts, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-follow-up-thoughts/)

<details><summary>Other ways to look at prestige - a response from Scott Alexander to Kevin Simler</summary><p>

> "I worry no one theory can completely explain prestige. It seems to me to be a combination of several different things:
>
> 1. **Group signaling.** The people I admire say a lot about me. If I admire Elon Musk, it means that I’m really into space, technology, and maybe the free market. If I admire the Pope, it means I’m really into Catholicism. If I admire David Bowie, it means I’m fabulous. Learning about these people, celebrating their accomplishments, and joining their Official Fan Clubs is an important method of bonding with other people.
>
> 2. **Coattail riding.** If a prestigious person becomes more prestigious, I might “look good” for having supported them “before they got big”. It suggests that I’m a good judge of character, or “hip” enough to know which acts will take off and which ones will never achieve broader appeal. Just as a fan feels good when his sports team wins the Superbowl, and a patriot feels good every time her country wins a war, so being a known Elon Musk fan means I get to feel a tiny fragment of the glory whenever Elon Musk invents a new rocket.
>
> 3. **Prestige by association.** Prestigious people hang out with other prestigious people. Nonprestigious people hang out with other nonprestigious people. If I have access to prestigious people, even in some boring trivial way, that makes me seem more prestigious. I think this is what’s going on with the hypothetical airplane conversation with the Koch brothers. Yes, in some sense it’s sheer coincidence that I run into them on a flight. In another sense it isn’t; at the very least, it probably means I was flying first class, and I must have had some rudimentary level of social skills to engage them in conversation. I’m signaling that I’m the sort of person who, at least when everything goes right, can shmooze with billionaires. Even if deep down people know that it was mostly a coincidence, on some gut level that’s kind of impressive.
>
> 4. **Tit for tat.** Yes, in some cases we will be close enough to prestigious people that we can expect rewards for our support. It’s probably easier to flatter my boss or my favorite teacher effectively than to flatter Justin Bieber or the Koch brothers, and you can reasonably expect special treatment. This is a good way of forging an alliance. If I praise my boss, she benefits from my elevation: having a nobody admire you is boring, but having a somebody admire you is both flattering & practically useful. Therefore, the more I admire and support my boss, the more she is incentivized to help me become a somebody.
>
> 5. **Virtuous cycles.** Suppose that, for reasons 1 through 4, people want to be associated with prestigious people. Note that this is different from “associate with prestigious people” in the sense of meeting them directly; anything that gets their name linked to the prestigious person will work. In fact, suppose that specifically, there are a bunch of conservatives who are really into the Koch brothers and are jockeying for position as Koch brother fan #1. Some of these people might play the strategy of according me prestige for having met the Koch brothers as a way of better signaling their own respect for the Koch brothers to third parties. That gives me a separate incentive to seek such prestige by association." - [Contra Simler on Prestige, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/10/21/contra-simler-on-prestige/)

A response from Kevin Simler to Scott Alexander's response (and a second attempt at explaining prestige using Dessalles' theory):

> "... in my [original post](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/) I tried to make three main points about social status:
>
> 1. It's not a single phenomenon, but rather two: dominance and prestige. These two systems are more-or-less distinct, and it's useful to think about them separately.
>
> 2. Dominance can be understood from the top-down, but prestige needs to be understood from the bottom-up — by focusing on admiration, i.e., the way we fawn over people we respect.
>
> 3. Admiration evolved to help us curry favor with actual or potential teammates. It's the price we pay to remain in the good graces of prestigious individuals — to earn a spot on their team and/or keep them happy as a teammate.
>
> (All of this, I hasten to add, is cribbed from [Jean-Louis Dessalles](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Talk-Evolutionary-Evolution/dp/0199563462).)
>
> Scott seems on board with 1 and 2, less on board with 3. Yes, he says, admiration often seems to work as a way of sucking up to teammates, but there are also a lot of cases where it doesn't make sense... I continue to believe that admiration makes sense in each of these cases... the bigger problem ... is that I did a mediocre job of explaining Dessalles' theory. So let me try again,
using fresh language.
>
> DESSALLES' THEORY OF PRESTIGE (TAKE 2)
>
> Admiration and prestige-seeking are two complementary teaming instincts. (By "teaming," here, I'm referring to the [game of coalition politics](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2013/11/the-coalition-politics-hypothesis.html)...)
>
> In Dessalles' theory, the teams we care about are groups small enough for everyone to know everyone else and keep tabs on their behavior. We might also call them alliances, cliques, gangs, or coalitions. Even a pair of friends, it should be noted, is considered a "team" for our purposes here; it's just a degenerate team of size two. Each of us, of course, is simultaneously a member of many different (but partially-overlapping) teams... From an individual's perspective, teaming instincts help solve a number of related problems:
>
> • How to join up with a team (ideally a worthy one) and convince them to accept you.
>
> • How to attract other members to the team (ideally people who are competent and useful).
>
> • How to remain in the team's good graces, so as not to get kicked out.
>
> • How to secure for yourself a reasonable share of the team's spoils. Spoils are whatever resources or benefits the team works together to acquire. For a firm, its spoils are its profits. For a prison gang, spoils include physical protection and access to black market transactions. For a coalition of our forager ancestors (especially a sub-group coalition), spoils probably included food, mating opportunities, support from teammates during conflicts with non-teammates, and support during times of illness or injury.
>
> In this context, a person's prestige is the measure of her value to a team (in the eyes of its members). If she has lots of prestige, it's because she's (perceived to be) better at most facets of teaming and teamwork. As a joiner, she'll be more attractive to existing teams. Within a team, she'll be more productive and therefore more worthy of her teammates' admiration. This, in turn, means she'll deserve a larger share of the spoils and will be less likely to get kicked off the team. She will also, simply by being on a team, make it more attractive to outsiders who might consider joining it. So we seek prestige in order to raise our value on the teaming market, and we admire others as a way of bribing them to join (or stay on) the team. Prestige is our price, and admiration our method of payment. It's important to note that in healthy, functioning teams, admiration is paid all around. Every teammate admires every other teammate — not equally, of course, but enough to keep the team together. More prestigious team members receive the most admiration, but even the least prestigious members get their share, as long as they remain in good standing. This kind of mutual admiration, in fact, is the very mechanism by which teams divvy up the spoils. Everyone needs to get paid, somehow, and admiration (commensurate with prestige) is how we do it.
>
> Incidentally, we can reformulate this in the language of friendship rather than teams. Due to natural variation, people differ in their personal qualities, and some people make better friends/allies than others. A prestigious individual, then, is someone many others would like to be friends with, someone highly sought after as a friend. And this is where market dynamics take over. A person has only so much friendship to offer; supply is limited. So when the demand goes up, the price has to go up too. Prestigious individuals, then, are those who can command a high price for their friendship. Now consider the problem of how to make and keep a friend. To earn someone's friendship, you need to make it worth his while. If the two of you are equally prestigious (equally valuable on the friendship market), you can simply barter in kind: your friendship for his. But if he's more prestigious than you, your friendship alone won't pay for his, and you'll have to make up the difference somehow. Those additional payments are what we've been calling admiration." - [Social Status II: Cults and Loyalty, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-ii-cults-and-loyalty/)

<details><summary>On Cults & Loyalty - continuation of Kevin Simler's response to Scott Alexander</summary><p>

> "BACK TO BOWIE (AND FRIENDS)
>
> I hope the explanation above was clear enough. Now, in light of it, what are we to make of our admiration for David Bowie? If we somehow managed to meet him, why would we be so eager to charm and flatter him? It's not that we're trying to keep him on Team USA or Team "The West." Instead, we cozy up to him hoping he'll have a spot for us on Team Bowie; we're trying to befriend him personally. Why? Because being friends with a rockstar has its perks: epic parties, beautiful people, the latest designer drugs. Maybe he'll invite us backstage at his next show, for example, where we'll meet some cute girl or guy or get to rub shoulders with influential people. Bottom line: David Bowie has a lot of resources, especially in the form of social capital, and would therefore make a great friend or ally. That's why we pay him in respect and admiration.
>
> **The Koch brothers**. Assuming you don't like the Koch brothers, why treat them nicely if you happen to sit next to them on a plane? Well, first of all, it's possible you'd actually snub them — if you really hated them, or really wanted to signal your righteousness to others. But if you're even slightly open to them as potential allies, as people you might personally befriend, their extreme prestige makes them worth treating well. Who knows what might happen if they take a liking to you. They might buy you a few drinks, for example, or offer you a ride home in their limo, or put you in touch with one of their influential friends who can help you on a project. When you're nice to people, they tend to be nice in return. And when you're nice to high-status people, their niceness-in-return can be very nice indeed.
>
> **Elon Musk and Justin Bieber**. Why do millions of people admire these celebrities that they'll never meet in person? Here's how I would parse the situation. First we need to distinguish between admiring someone in person, by deferring to them in concrete social situations, and admiring someone from afar, simply by thinking or speaking highly of them. Dessalles' theory applies only to in-person admiration. Long-distance admiration — like the kind we direct at Musk or Bieber — is something else entirely. One possible explanation for long-distance admiration is that it helps us keep track of people who are worth admiring up close, in case we ever get the chance. And since long-distance admiration doesn't cost much, why not? But this doesn't explain the intensity of the admiration that Musk and Bieber arouse in us; it doesn't explain why we become such rabid fans. So Scott suggests there might be group-signaling effects here, and I think he's right. By gushing about Elon Musk on my Facebook account, for example, I'm not trying to tee up a friendship with the man himself. (As it happens, we aren't FB friends.) Instead, it's more likely that I'm signaling to other Musk supporters — showing that I'm aligned with them and their values, for example, or that I'm smart and enlightened enough to appreciate Musk's contributions to the world. In other words, Musk himself — the man on the hill — isn't the primary target of my long-distance admiration, but rather the people down here in my local social circle. All this group signaling works to create a kind of cult around the admired figure. But note that cult objects aren't always living, breathing humans. We also get whipped into a frenzy of group signaling around:
>
> • Dead people like Jesus, Confucius, and Shakespeare.
>
> • Abstract symbols like "God," "America," and "Apple."
>
> • Concrete symbols like idols, totems, and flags.
>
> • Values or ideals like liberty, justice, and love.
>
> Elon Musk, then, is simultaneously a living person and a symbol representing the ideals of science, entrepreneurship, progress, etc. Insofar as he's a person, we pay respect in the hope of befriending him, i.e., earning a spot on Team Musk. Insofar as he's a symbol, we pay respect to him (or more precisely, to the idea of him) for the same reason we kneel before any altar: to curry favor with fellow worshippers. In a cult of personality, these two processes overlap and reinforce each other. But I contend that they can and should be analyzed separately.
>
> **Helen Keller**. Keller has been dead almost 50 years, so most of our current admiration for her is necessarily cultic. But even while she was alive, she was quite prestigious. Was it simply because she had an inspiring life story? Did people simply fetishize her as a symbol of perseverance? I might have thought so. But after reading her [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller), a [New Yorker piece about her](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/06/16/what-helen-keller-saw), and [Mark Twain's high praise for her](http://www.historyofredding.com/epl/twain-keller-exhibit1.htm), I have to conclude that she was genuinely impressive. She wasn't just a public curiosity — "that blind deaf girl who learned to speak." She was also a prolific author (12 books!), a world-famous public speaker, and an energetic political activist. She campaigned aggressively for radical causes like women's suffrage, birth control, and pacifism, and was influential enough that some people found it necessary to attack her for her views. She even helped found the ACLU. I'm sure Keller capitalized plenty on her life story, but the point is she was very successful at it, and would have made a valuable ally.
>
> A FINAL THOUGHT
>
> As I write this, it occurs to me that **loyalty** interacts with prestige in a way that illuminates both phenomena. Within an existing team (including friendship "teams" of size two), your prestige reflects your value to your teammates. More precisely, it's the expected value of all your future contributions to the team — your [NPV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value), if you will. Now, in light of this, how might you go about increasing your prestige?
>
> One strategy is to improve yourself — by learning new skills, for example — so that you'll be able to accomplish things of greater value. You thereby increase the expected size of your future contributions to the team. But there's another, complementary strategy: try to increase the expected number of your future contributions. How? By convincing your teammates that you're likely to stick around longer.
>
> The transaction is simple. In return for your loyalty, you earn your teammates' trust. And the interesting thing about trust — arguably, the essential thing — is that it isn't portable. When you leave a team, you can take everything else with you (skills, knowledge, money), but all that accumulated trust stays behind. In other words, prestige has two components: a general-purpose "global" component and a team-specific "local" component. Global prestige includes everything valued on the outside market: skills, knowledge, money, relationships with outsiders. Local prestige includes everything not transferable to the outside market — trust, relationships with teammates, and team-specific knowledge and skills. I think this helps explain why loyalty-signaling practices are so powerful, and produce such dramatic effects. Watch how loyalty-signaling can quickly escalate out of control:
>
> 1. We begin with an initiate, who wishes to raise his value by demonstrating loyalty to his group. Words aren't enough: he needs to make honest (costly) commitments, i.e., by doing things that make it harder for him to leave the group. Techniques here include: severing ties with outsiders, doubling down on relationships with insiders, and undertaking lifestyle changes (diet, clothes, living arrangements) that make it harder to interact with the outside world.
>
> 2. In return for these demonstrations of loyalty, the initiate is rewarded with trust, i.e., local prestige — something that increases his value within the group, but which has no benefit to him if he decides to leave. In other words, his reward for binding himself to the group is... something that further binds him to the group.
>
> 3. Unfortunately local prestige, like global prestige, is a zero-sum game. So in order to compete for it, team members need to out-do each other, e.g., with even more extreme loyalty displays. This kind of competition is similar to what we find in any other prestige tournament (art, music, sports, academia, etc.). The main difference lies in the direction competitors are selling themselves for prestige: artists and athletes sell themselves outward, while loyalty-signaling teammates sell inward.
>
> 4. Finally, if processes 1–3 are strong enough, most group members will end up fairly committed to the group. They'll draw their admiration largely from other group members, and they'll experience a large drop in status if they ever try to leave. All this, in turn, gives everyone a strong incentive to make sure everyone else remains loyal to the group. The peer pressure that results is likely to be intense.
>
> Religions often take these processes to an extreme. Adherents scramble to signal commitment as a way of jockeying for local prestige. In this context, everyone is anxious to do and say the right things. Schelling points for "proper" beliefs and behaviors are established quickly, resulting in capricious orthodoxies and bizarre ritual practices. And because loyalty is what's at stake, the group will tend to prefer beliefs and behaviors that are costly to maintain and perform. Orthodox Jews spurn food from non-Kosher kitchens. Fundamentalist Christians deny evolution. Christian Scientists refuse blood transfusions. Mormons wear special underwear. And every religion asks for weekly devotion. In each of these "transactions," adherents sacrifice their status with outsiders as part of a calculated gambit to earn greater status among their co-religionists." - [Social Status II: Cults and Loyalty, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/social-status-ii-cults-and-loyalty/)

# Tribalism - Status & Loyalty Over Truth

> "Why do people want to improve their reputation? Well, our main evolutionary goals in life are survival and reproduction. Having a good reputation is what makes those goals possible — it’s what makes people want to work with you, take care of you, and partner with you.
>
> But how do status and reputation work? Think about it like this: imagine we all have a number floating above our heads — that's our status score. We can't see it, but we have a sense for where we rank — dating apps even go so far as to quantify it. Over time we learn to perceive both our own score and that of others.
>
> We’re so attune to our status score that we’re laser focused on increasing it even at the expense of seeing objective reality, or truth. As Don Hoffman writes in “The Case Against Reality” *“An organism that sees reality as it truly is is never more fit than an organism of equal complexity that sees none of reality and is just attuned to fitness payoffs”* Or as Don says elsewhere: *“Optimizing for truth can make you extinct.”*
>
> It’s not that we’ll see objective reality (or truth) and consciously ignore it—our brains won’t even filter for it in the first place. In other words, the first thing we see isn’t whether something is true or not, and then decide whether it’s good for us. We do the opposite: We first filter for what’s good for us, and then filter for truth—this explains why we feel emotions first, and then rationalize them after.
>
> To be sure, this doesn’t mean objective reality doesn’t exist. It means we often don’t perceive reality accurately because it’s not aligned with our interest. We think people are rational, but if anything, recent scientific discoveries tell us most of human rationality is not used to make decisions, but rather to come up with arguments to rationalize decisions the subconscious brain has already made.
>
> ... The best deceiver is the person who doesn’t even know they’re deceiving. If you truly believe your lie, you won’t betray it. So not only are there selection pressures to deceive others, but also to deceive yourself. The more you deceive yourself, the better you can deceive—or convince—others of the same narrative. The best salespeople are the most fervent believers, those with no traces of doubt.
>
> ... What does the prioritization of the status score over objective reality imply? That people who want social status will believe and say whatever is convenient, no matter how crazy. Indeed, it’s more predictive to think of “belief” not as something someone thinks of as true, but as something someone thinks will improve their reputation. Want more evidence people don’t prioritize objective truth? You may have noticed that after centuries of the scientific method, people still believe in things like Astrology.
>
> And that’s exactly why the precise content of any ideological point doesn't matter. Brains don’t care about ideology. They didn’t evolve to care about abstract concepts. Indeed: Many people are hypocrites with regard to their overt ideological claims if they can get away with it. Rich elites talk about Global Warming while living in lavish mansions and flying private. Rich parents talk about the importance of public schools while they put their kids in fancy private schools. Cognitive dissonance? No; those cognitive systems are not connected to begin with.
>
> ... This is why people aren’t open to changing their minds — because there's no reason they should be. Ideas aren’t about logic, they’re about loyalty. Ideas are [Schelling points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) for tribes. If saying certain things means you’ll make more friends, well, you’re probably going to say those things. That’s the purpose of ideas — to make better friends.
>
> This is also why arguments are often useless, and only cause people to dig into their pre-existing positions. All this stuff about steel-manning other arguments to find truth—it may catalyze scientific progress, but in most social circles, it’s also a surefire way to lose friends and alienate people. (Which is why people who do so are heroes, and why communities who encourage it are foundational for progress).
>
> Indeed: Understanding how the outgroup thinks is frowned upon. You’re not supposed to try to understand what’s going on. You’re supposed to not get it and loudly condemn it. We think of this blind allegiance as harmful behavior, but it actually signals and induces loyalty to one’s in-group.
>
> ... So then why do we care so much about politics? What's the point of ideology? Ideology is the water you swim in. It’s a structured database of excuses, used to signal your allegiance or defection to the existing ruling coalition. This is why fanatics of one political stripe sometimes convert to fanatics of the other. Different ideas suit different people at different times. Ideas can adapt to people, but more often than not people adapt to ideas. Which is why the culture war is so existential — because the marketplace of ideas isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit. They don’t really care where they get it; they only care that it’s good.
>
> So what determines what people say? It seems clear that the default mode of thinking for humans is groupthink, and the content of that groupthink is computed with a complex algorithm taking into account one's peer group, the loyalties one owes and to whom, who has more status and what talking points fit better with the religion that one has been dutifully drilled into since kindergarten.
>
> ... The burden of having to realize our constant self-deception is too big of a cross to bear, since it threatens the edifice of our reality.
>
> ... Given how ideologies actually work, a gene that made you consistent with your ideology couldn't possibly spread in the gene pool. But a gene for the ability to adroitly deploy Orwellian talking points to signal your loyalty to the winning tribe — now that's helpful." - [Truth, Status, and Tribes, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/truth-status-and-tribes)

> "The goal is not to persuade. The goal is to subtly punish people for questioning our dogmas or dissing our allies. When we argue about politics, we’re playing The Opinion Game—the secret war over social norms. And the norm we want to establish is: respect our tribe." - [Arguing Is Bullshit, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/arguing-is-bullshit)

TODO: expand on how to counter this - reputation, integration of opinions for coherence, detecting hypocricy, incentivising changing your mind and understanding other perspectives more than loyalty, incentivizing original thought that goes against the grain/groupthink, etc.
















# Pretending to not be playing status games

> "We all want status, but we can’t admit it. Why? Because it’s uncool. Wanting status makes us look selfish, insecure, and low-status. Ew. We’re not supposed to care about petty things like money or fame; we’re supposed to care about noble things like integrity or authenticity or something. Admitting we’re desperate for status is like admitting we’re horny for a co-worker or jealous of a friend’s success: it’s not a good look. So we pretend we don’t care about status, as a way of gaining status. It’s kind of confusing.
>
> That means status games—i.e., the mutually-agreed-upon rules for winning and losing status—are fragile. We can only play a status game if we lack awareness that it’s a status game. As soon as we become aware of the game we’re playing, we stop getting status for playing it. In fact, we lose status: we look selfish, insecure, and low-status. Ew. So virtue signalers cannot know they’re virtue signaling, and neither can the people who award them virtue. “Brave” truth-tellers cannot know they’re seeking praise from their political tribe, and neither can the tribe who praises them. “Rebellious” nonconformists cannot know they’re conforming to the norms of their subculture, and neither can their subculture. Status games must never be emblazoned with a neon sign that says “STATUS GAME”, or else they’ll disintegrate in the light like vampires. We have to play our status games in the dark.
>
> So what happens when the lights come on? The game collapses. People stop playing, for fear of looking uncool. Instead, they start playing an anti-status game to show how cool and not-interested-in-status they are. The point of an anti-status game is to show that you care about more important things than status, like integrity or authenticity or something. Anti-status games emerge in opposition to a collapsing status game, and they often take the opposite form. If people are showing off their immaculately coifed hair, for example, anti-status-seekers might wear their hair artfully tussled.
>
> In other words, anti-status games are just another kind of status game. We could remove the “anti” if we wanted to, but it’s useful to keep it there to get a handle on what’s going on, so we can see why these games are so weird. Status games are constantly collapsing and re-emerging in antithetical forms. They give rise to anti-status games, then anti-anti-status games, and so on. Different cultures split off as status symbols twirl in fractal, quasi-cyclical patterns." - [Status Is Weird, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/status-is-weird#:~:text=We%20all%20want,quasi%2Dcyclical%20patterns.)

There's also ethnographic evidence that bragging and bigshot behavior is severely punished in hunter gatherer societies (see Christopher Boehm's Hierarchy in the Forest and Moral Origins)." - [Status Is Weird, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/status-is-weird?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=39015446)

> "We spend our lives desperately seeking status; we are addicted to social esteem in a fairly literal sense, dependent on the neurotransmitters we get upon impressing people. Many of us claim to be self-sufficient, to have a moral gyroscope, to hold fast to our values, come what may. But people truly oblivious to peer approval get labeled sociopaths. And the epithets reserved for people at the other end of the spectrum, people who seek esteem most ardently—“self-promoter,” “social climber”—are only signs of our constitutional blindness. We are all self-promoters and social climbers. The people known as such are either so effective as to arouse envy or so graceless as to make their effort obvious, or both." - [Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9799532-we-spend-our-lives-desperately-seeking-status-we-are-addicted)

# Deliberately choosing & designing our collective status games

> "But is it possible to evaluate our status games from a more rational, dispassionate perspective? Can we somehow learn to defend the status games that actually make the world better and attack the ones that actually make the world worse? Is our sorry species even remotely capable of such a project?
>
> Maybe? Possibly? If there’s any way to pull it off, it’s by appealing to young people, or people having a midlife crisis, or people who haven’t yet won too many status points in any particular game, or who don’t yet know which game they’re most likely to win. Maybe if we urge these on-the-fence people to think a little harder about which status game to play, we can gradually, as a species, move toward status games that make us all better off.
>
> And maybe that project—the quest to improve the world through thinking hard and seeing through bullshit—is a sacred value too, a covert status game that you and I are playing, and convincing other people to play, because we think we stand a good chance of winning it...

> "The whole point of the human brain is behavioural flexibility." - [The Moral Animal (1994), by Robert Wright](https://twitter.com/robertwrighter)

> "The worst parts of human nature are always near the surface - ready to rise when cultural restraints weaken. We are not blank slates as some behavioralists once imagined. We are organisms whose more egregious tendencies can be greatly if arduously subdued and the primary reason for this tenuous optimism is the abject flexibility whith which status is sought. We will do almost anything for respect, including: not act like animals." - [The Moral Animal (1994), by Robert Wright](https://twitter.com/robertwrighter)

“Let the (status) game begin”
With a picture of the clown from the movie “saw”

we need to change our concept of status
People grind for status in the dumbest possible pay-to-win “games” - we need to give them an avenue for their competitiveness and expression

> "The more people who follow you, the more followers you gain because of leaderboards and recommended follower algorithms and other such common discovery mechanisms. It's true that as more people join a network, more social capital is up for grabs in the aggregate. However, in general, if you come to a social network later, unless you bring incredible exogenous social capital (Taylor Swift can join any social network on the planet and collect a massive following immediately), the competition for attention is going to be more intense than it was in the beginning. Everyone has more of an understanding of how the game works so the competition is stiffer." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=The%20more%20people,competition%20is%20stiffer.)

> "Value is tied to scarcity, and scarcity on social networks derives from proof of work. Status isn't worth much if there's no skill and effort required to mine it. It's not that a social network that makes it easy for lots of users to perform well can't be a useful one, but competition for relative status still motivates humans. Recall our first tenet: humans are status-seeking monkeys. Status is a relative ladder. By definition, if everyone can achieve a certain type of status, it’s no status at all, it’s a participation trophy." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Value%20is%20tied,a%20participation%20trophy.)

> "Thirst for status is potential energy. It is the lifeblood of a Status as a Service business. To succeed at carving out unique space in the market, social networks offer their own unique form of status token, earned through some distinctive proof of work." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Thirst%20for%20status%20is%20potential%20energy.%20It%20is%20the%20lifeblood%20of%20a%20Status%20as%20a%20Service%20business.%20To%20succeed%20at%20carving%20out%20unique%20space%20in%20the%20market%2C%20social%20networks%20offer%20their%20own%20unique%20form%20of%20status%20token%2C%20earned%20through%20some%20distinctive%20proof%20of%20work.)

> "Graph-based social capital allocation mechanisms can suffer from runaway winner-take-all effects. In essence, some networks reward those who gain a lot of followers early on with so much added exposure that they continue to gain more followers than other users, regardless of whether they've earned it through the quality of their posts. One hypothesis on why social networks tend to lose heat at scale is that this type of old money can't be cleared out, and new money loses the incentive to play the game." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=graph%2Dbased%20social,play%20the%20game.)

> "It's not that the existence of old money or old social capital dooms a social network to inevitable stagnation, but a social network should continue to prioritize distribution for the best content, whatever the definition of quality, regardless of the vintage of user producing it. Otherwise a form of social capital inequality sets in, and in the virtual world, where exit costs are much lower than in the real world, new users can easily leave for a new network where their work is more properly rewarded and where status mobility is higher." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=It%27s%20not%20that%20the,status%20mobility%20is%20higher.)

> "As a newbie, how quickly, if you put in the work, are you "in the game"? Proof of work should define its own meritocracy. The same way many social networks track keystone metrics like time to X followers, they should track the ROI on posts for new users. It's likely a leading metric that governs retention or churn." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=As%20a%20newbie,retention%20or%20churn.)

> "The Stories format is a genuine innovation on the social modesty problem of social networks. That is, all but the most egregious showoffs feel squeamish about publishing too much to their followers. Stories, by putting the onus on the viewer to pull that content, allows everyone to publish away guilt-free, without regard for the craft that regular posts demand in the ever escalating game that is life publishing." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=the%20Stories%20format,is%20life%20publishing.)

> "As people start following more and more accounts on a social network, they reach a point where the number of candidate stories exceeds their capacity to see them all. Even before that point, the sheer signal-to-noise ratio may decline to the point that it affects engagement. Almost any network that hits this inflection point turns to the same solution: an algorithmic feed. Remember, status derives value from some type of scarcity. What is the one fundamental scarcity in the age of abundance? User attention. The launch of an algorithmic feed raises the stakes of the social media game. Even if someone follows you, they might no longer see every one of your posts." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=As%20people%20start,of%20your%20posts.)

> "Could social networks have chosen to keep likes and other such metrics about posts private, visible only to the recipient? Could we have kept this social capital arms race from escalating? Some tech CEO's now look back and, like Alan Greenspan, bemoan the irrational exuberance that led us to where we are now, but let's be honest, the incentives to lower interest rates on social capital in all these networks, given their goals and those of their investors, were just too great. If one company hadn’t flooded the market with status, others would have filled the void many times over." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Could%20social%20networks,many%20times%20over.)

> "Young people are generally social capital poor unless they've lucked into a fat inheritance. They have no job title, they may not have finished college, they own few assets like homes and cars, and often if they've finished college they're saddled with substantial school debt. For them, the fastest and most efficient path to gaining social capital, while they wait to level up enough to win at more grown-up games like office politics, is to ply their trade on social media or video games." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Young%20people%20are,or%20video%20games)

> "If this generational divide on social media between the old and the young was simply a one-time anomaly given the recent birth of social networks, and if future generations will be virtual status-seeking experts for womb to tomb, then capturing users in their formative social media years becomes even more critical for social networks." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=If%20this%20generational,for%20social%20networks.)

> "Teens and twenty-somethings, more so than the middle-aged and elderly, tend to juggle more identities. In middle and high school, kids have to maintain an identity among classmates at school, then another identity at home with family. Twenty-somethings craft one identity among coworkers during the day, then another among their friends outside of work. Often those spheres have differing status games, and there is some penalty to merging those identities." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=teens%20and%20twenty,merging%20those%20identities.)

> "The expiration of content, whether explicitly executed on Instagram (you can easily kill off a meme account after you've outgrown it, for example), or automatically handled on a service like Snapchat, is a must-have feature for those for whom multiple identity management is a fact of life. Facebook, with its explicit attachment to the real world graph and its enforcement of a single public identity, is just a poor structural fit for the more complex social capital requirements of the young." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=The%20expiration%20of,of%20the%20young.)

> "Remember Snapchat's original Best Friends list? I'm going to guess many of my readers don't, because, as noted earlier, old people probably didn't play that status game, if they'd even figured out how to use Snapchat by that point. This was just about as pure a status game feature as could be engineered for teens. Not only did it show the top three people you Snapped with most frequently, you could look at who the top three best friends were for any of your contacts. Essentially, it made the hierarchy of everyone's “friendships” public, making the popularity scoreboard explicit.
>
> As with aggregate follower counts and likes, the Best Friends list was a mechanism for people to accumulate a very specific form of social capital. From a platform perspective, however, there's a big problem with this feature: each user could only have one best friend. It put an artificial ceiling on the amount of social capital one could compete for and accumulate.
>
> In a clever move to unbound social capital accumulation and to turn a zero-sum game into a positive sum game, broadening the number of users working hard or engaging, Snapchat deprecated the very popular Best Friends list and replaced it with streaks.
>
> If you and a friend Snap back and forth for consecutive days, you build up a streak which is tracked in your friends list. Young people quickly threw their heart and souls into building and maintaining streaks with their friends. This was literally proof of work as proof of friendship, quantified and tracked.
>
> Streaks, of course, have the wonderful quality of being unbounded. You can maintain as many streaks as you like. If you don't think social capital has value, you've never seen, as I have, a young person sobbing over having to go on vacation without their phone, or to somewhere without cell or wifi access, only to see all their streaks broken. Some kids have resorted, when forced to go abroad on a vacation, to leaving their phone with a friend who helps to keep all the streaks alive, like some sort of social capital babysitter or surrogate.
>
> What's hilarious is how efficiently young people maintain streaks. It's a daily ritual that often consists of just quickly running down your friend list and snapping something random, anything, just to increment the streak count. My nephew often didn’t even bother framing the camera up, most his streak-maintenance snaps were blurry pics of the side of his elbow, half his shoulder, things like that.
>
> Of course, as evidence of the fragility of social capital structures, streaks have started to lose heat. Many younger users of Snapchat no longer bother with them. Maintaining social capital games is always going to be a volatile game, prone to sudden and massive deflationary events, but while they work, they’re a hell of a drug. They also can be useful; for someone Snapping frequently, like all teens do, having a best friends list sorted to the top of your distribution list is a huge time-saver. Social capital and utility often can’t be separated cleanly." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Remember%20Snapchat%27s%20original,be%20separated%20cleanly.)

> "Some people find status games distasteful. Despite this, everyone I know is engaged in multiple status games. Some people sneer at people hashtag spamming on Instagram, but then retweet praise on Twitter. Others roll their eyes at photo albums of expensive meals on Facebook but then submit research papers to prestigious journals in the hopes of being published. Parents show off photos of their children performances at recitals, people preen in the mirror while assessing their outfits, employees flex on their peers in meetings, entrepreneurs complain about 30 under 30 lists while wishing to be on them, reporters check the Techmeme leaderboards; life is nothing if not a nested series of status contests." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=Some%20people%20find,of%20status%20contests.)

> "The solution also doesn’t lie in ignoring that humans are wired to pursue social capital. In fact, overlooking this fundamental aspect of human nature arguably landed us here, at the end of this first age of social network goliaths, wondering where it all went haywire. If we think of these networks as marketplaces trading only in information, and not in status, then we're only seeing part of the machine." - [Status as a Service (StaaS)](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service#:~:text=the%20solution%20also,of%20the%20machine.)

The Hawthorne effect is a type of human behavior reactivity in which individuals modify an aspect of their behavior in response to their awareness of being observed.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect

What's the loss function of the media landscape? What if we quantified it? How do we incentivise error correction?

when someone does bad in terms of competence/accountability, in addition to a reputational penalty to them we could also penalize a bit those that gave their votes to that person - for empowering a rotten apple. We could also give rewards for delegating to the right person...?

if you see something that you think obviously has an agenda by the media - have a way to express it. Let's see in aggregate who thinks something is politically motivated and who is supporting it. slander needs to be on the record too because if it turns out false - there should be consequences to whoever wrote it

Pointing to the truth is a Schelling point - that's why sunlight is the best disinfectant - if we create the tools for people to elevate competency & sensemake - we win. That's the singularity - we are the most underutilized general intelligence

Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways.

Meritocracy can be computable and open-source
Meritocracy is the last revolution to be had
Meritocracy is true alignment and a prerequisite for consciousness
Meritocracy is a beautiful concept - the current implementation is what sucks


One big problem with meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy is that we've been unable to compute the reputation objectively for accountability. They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability. Proxies such as accreditation have proven bad.
Another criticism is one of lack of diversity and the superior results of the wisdom of crowds. But we can design a meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy however we like in order to maximize the collective intelligence of as many people as possible - it doesn't have to be a small clique of people that make all the contributions.
Also we can separate decision making from values & overall direction & goals so that we all get an equal vote for the values & direction.


> "What is a Meritocracy? The holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=What%20is%20a,of%20their%20ability.)

> "A meritocracy (in theory) is where we judge people on the basis of their individual abilities rather than their position in the social hierarchy or their family connections. For most of human history, we have not lived in anything resembling a meritocracy. Until recently, the most important institution in society was the family. You inherited your position and defined your identity as a member of a family. As a result, society was much more static than it is now. Social mobility was low, and all that mattered was who you knew. You didn’t get jobs on merit – they were regarded as things that people owned and could pass down to their children. What meritocracy did was create a new kind of aristocracy. The only alternative to the aristocracy of land and inheritance was to replace it with an aristocracy of virtue and talent." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=A%20meritocracy%20(in,virtue%20and%20talent.)

> "The strongest criticism of meritocracy is not that there's something bad about the idea of putting the best people in charge. The critique is that the best people are not in charge... The ruling elite aren’t actually the best, they just got lucky or won thanks to kleptocracy." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20strongest%20criticism,thanks%20to%20kleptocracy.)

> "It was always tricky to discern talent and effort from parents and social class and environment. To unbundle what's in your control (merit) from what isn't (circumstance). Which leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the "best" & who "earns" it. In one sense it’s a fair process in that, in a successful meritocracy, whoever’s the best, should get it. But in another sense it’s unfair in that people didn’t get the same chance. Because of biological or cultural factors, or just sheer luck, not everyone had the same starting line. And this is the fatal flaw of the term meritocracy — it is about who wins the race but, in its quest to be fair, implies there’s an equal starting line." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=it%20was%20always,equal%20starting%20line.)

> "And if we don’t literally mean *equality* of opportunity, let’s just say “sufficient opportunity for all”, meaning we focus on constantly expanding absolute opportunity, without focusing on relative opportunity. Indeed, we should focus on expanding opportunity for all, we should focus on equal treatment under the law for all." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=And%20if%20we,law%20for%20all)

> "Everything you love is a result of inequality. When you seek a mate, do you want someone who is exactly average, just like everyone else, or do you want someone who is special? When you have kids, do you want them to have the same life outcomes as every other kid in the world, or do you want them to do better than that? When you have a job, do you aspire to turn in absolutely average performance, to be careful not to ever exceed the performance of your peers? Or do you aspire to do the best you can, even if that means you do better than your peers? Is it moral to want the best surgeon, the best teachers, or the best spouse to raise a family with?" - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Everything%20you%20love,a%20family%20with%3F)

> "Belief in an aristocracy of talent is self-fulfilling. If people believe the best people can rise up, and that effort impacts outcomes, they’ll work for it. Which is why threading this needle matters: The best people should be in charge, via a transparent process where anyone can prove they’re the best, but also accepting that people had different opportunities to begin with. In other words, we’re all running the same race, but at different starting lines. And that’s OK. Let’s try to move up everyone’s starting lines, without trying to hold anyone back, and more importantly, let’s try to maximize how far everyone can go." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Belief%20in%20an,everyone%20can%20go.)

> "The quality of a meritocracy is a product of (1) the team of people and (2) the way those people interact with each other. A meritocracy (and the business itself) is ultimately judged by its (3) outcomes (i.e., performance relative to goals). We spend time defining and measuring the effectiveness of our team and our interactions because we believe that they drive the outcomes on which the company depends directly and that they also drive our outcomes over the longer-term." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20quality%20of,the%20longer%2Dterm)

> "We are aiming for interactions that get the best out of individuals and the team, with truth and a deep desire to excel at their core. We think great leadership in this context is lots of “people in the arena”, meaning people who will relentlessly pursue truth wherever it takes them and who are totally unwilling to be on the sidelines. This means they are: (1) speaking up and exposing their honest thoughts and willing to be wrong, (2) unafraid to be transparent about their stumbles, imperfections, and decision-making and, (3) seeking to find the best ideas and get the most out of others through deliberate inclusion." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=We%20are%20aiming,through%20deliberate%20inclusion.)

> "The more unsure you are and the more assumptions you’re making, the more important it is to engage with curiosity rather than starting with assertions or certainty. In a meritocracy, greatness isn’t being the best debater, winning the most arguments, or personally having the right answer most often. It’s being honest about what you truly think while engaging with deep humility and the intent to learn, and in doing so increasing the probability of the team succeeding. Every member of the community has a responsibility to be honest and direct, and we expect a constant flow of feedback in all directions. It is most critical that feedback flow from those with less power to those with more, not because those with less power should bear the greatest burden, but because there are relatively more challenges to feedback moving in that direction — everything from power dynamics to frequency of interaction. In line with that everyone, but most especially leaders, has a responsibility not just to solicit honesty from others, but to assess whether that’s actually happening across all levels and if not, to diagnose why." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20more%20unsure,to%20diagnose%20why.)

> "Transparency includes everything from exposing the logic of decisions, to putting light on mistakes, to giving feedback publicly, and more. By and large, you should start from the place that more light is better." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy)

> "Focusing on outcomes increases the probability of a good design because it forces you to evaluate whether the team and interactions are sufficient to achieve what you want. It also creates more entrepreneurialism, innovation, and pushes people out on the risk curve as incentives align and teams come together and interact around a shared destination and value creation." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20outcomes,and%20value%20creation.)

Jim Rutt Show EP #32: Jason Brennan on Irrational Democracy & Academia
epistocracy !!!
Problems with democracy and voters:
- people disinterested in politics - not voting at all
- very low understanding of what is going on
- systematic misinformation - not just ignorance - ppl get the facts wrong
- different responses to political questions even after just 1 week without anything having changed - random answers
- partisanship, tribalism & confirmation (& disconfirmation) bias
- ignorance, apathy, irrationality
- no skin in the game
- position bias (pick the first thing, pay less attention to anything other than the 1st page, etc.)
- likeability - superficial features of candidates
- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "In Just Hierarchy, Daniel Bell and Wang Pei argue that hierarchies are inevitable. Faced with ever-increasing complexity at scale, modern societies must build hierarchies to coordinate collective action and tackle long-term problems such as climate change. In this context, people need not—and should not—want to flatten hierarchies as much as possible. They ought to ask what makes political hierarchies just and use these criteria to decide the institutions that deserve preservation, those that require reform, and those that need radical transformation. They call this approach "progressive conservatism", a term that reflects the ambiguous place of the Confucian tradition within the Left-Right dichotomy.
>
> Bell and Wang propose two justifications for political hierarchies that do not depend on a "one person, one vote" system. First is raw efficiency, which may require centralized rule in the hands of the competent few. Second, and most important, is serving the interests of the people (and the common good more broadly). In Against Political Equality, Tongdong Bai complements this account by using a proto-Rawlsian "political difference principle". Just as Rawls claims that economic inequality is justified so long as it benefits those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, so Bai argues that political inequality is justified so long as it benefits those materially worse off.
>
> Bell, Wang, and Bai all criticize liberal democracy to argue that government by the people may not be government for the people in any meaningful sense of the term. They argue that voters tend to act in irrational, tribal, short-termist ways; they are vulnerable to populism and struggle to account for the interests of future generations. In other words, at a minimum, democracy needs Confucian meritocratic checks.
>
> In The China Model, Bell argues that Confucian political meritocracy provides—and has provided—a blueprint for China's development. For Bell, the ideal according to which China should reform itself (and has reformed itself) follows a simple structure: Aspiring rulers first pass hyper-selective examinations, then have to rule well at the local level to be promoted to positions as the provincial level, then have to excel at the provincial level to access positions at the national level, and so on. This system aligns with what Harvard historian James Hankins calls "virtue politics", or the idea that institutions should be built to select the most competent and virtuous rulers—as opposed to institutions concerned first and foremost with limiting the power of rulers.
>
> While contemporary defenders of Confucian political meritocracy all accept this broad frame, they disagree with each other on three main questions: institutional design, the means by which meritocrats are promoted, and the compatibility of Confucian political meritocracy with liberalism." - [Confucian Meritocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism#Organisation_and_liturgy:~:text=In%20Just%20Hierarchy,meritocracy%20with%20liberalism.)

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

> "We have to ask ourselves what we think government is actually for. Some people think it has the value a painting has, which is to say that it’s symbolic. In that view, you might think, “We should have democracy because it’s a way of civilizing and expressing the idea that all of us have equal value.”
>
> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people. So if you think government is for that purpose, and I do, then you have to wonder if we should pick the form of government that best delivers the goods, whatever that might be." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20to,that%20might%20be.)

> "There was a time in British history ([from around 1600 until 1950](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-history-of-university-representation/)) where people who had college degrees would get an extra vote, but this was a stupid idea. It pains me to say this as an educator, but it turns out that university education has very little impact on how much people know. In general, college-educated people know more than non-college-educated people, but it’s not the college that’s making the difference." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=There%20was%20a,making%20the%20difference.)

We get your demographic information, which is anonymously coded, because that stuff affects how you vote and what you support.And the third thing you do is take a quiz of very basic political knowledge. When we have those three bits of information, we can then statistically estimate what the public would have wanted if it was fully informed.

But, as Brennan reports, the mathematical models that have been proposed work only if voter ignorance has no shape of its own—if, for example, voters err on the side of liberalism as often as they err on the side of conservatism, leaving decisions in the hands of a politically knowledgeable minority in the center. Unfortunately, voter ignorance does seem to have a shape." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Political%20scientists%20have,have%20a%20shape.)

Even deeply ignorant voters, it is claimed, can effectively punish incumbents for bad performance and reward them if things go well. But if voters’ understanding of which officials are responsible for which outcomes is systematically biased, retrospective voting becomes an independent source of political failure rather than a cure for it. We design and administer a new survey of the general public and political experts to test for such biases.

There is such a thing of having greater knowledge of the Good, and there is no reason that increased reliance of such knowledge shouldn’t be part of epistocratic reforms." - [A Little Less Democracy, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/03/05/a-little-less-democracy/)

> "As robust as discussion on democracy’s defects has been, it is unclear what institutional forms should actually be pursued in light of it. Hanson’s futarchy seems completely politically infeasible, though there may be places in which betting markets can be introduced to aid in decision-making. Brennan suggests a form of epistocracy where more votes are given to those who are more informed—perhaps more feasible than Hanson’s, but still anathema to American political values. Caplan simply wishes to massively reduce the size of government so fewer decisions are made so irrationally. This, too, seems unlikely, not to mention that such a reduction in the size of government would also cost valuable state capacity.
>
> Yet institutional reforms that make our democracy more epistocratic—that give more control over our political epistemology and goals to those best qualified—could be beneficial. But where exactly should these reforms take place? How can they be done without disrupting the high-quality aspects of American governance? Which reforms would be most valuable? It is these questions that Jones’ book aims to answer. Jones asks not for systemic change, but simply that we begin experimenting with, on the margin, less democracy.
>
> The book begins by postulating a Laffer Curve for democracy. Imagine positive outcomes as a Y-axis and level of democracy as the X-Axis. With no democracy, outcomes are poor. With some amount of democracy, outcomes are optimal. With too much democracy, outcomes begin to worsen. Jones suggests that some advanced economies may have drifted too far to the right on the X-axis, and could improve their outcomes by reducing their level of democracy in favor of slightly more elite and expert control.
>
> As Jones points out, there are already undemocratic elements of American governance that function very well, such as the Federal Reserve and the Judiciary. We know from cross-country comparisons, which Jones details, that countries with less independent central banks and court systems do markedly less well across a number of domains.
>
> Given that we are comfortable, and indeed benefit from these undemocratic institutions, Jones suggests more that we might experiment with more of the like. For example, perhaps the specifics of tax policy should be decided by an appointed committee so as to create simpler and more efficient rules. Perhaps government bondholders should have more influence, so that democracies think more about long-term fiscal responsibility. Perhaps congressional earmarks should return to allow for more win-win deal-making. It is ideas like these that Jones’ book considers, marginally undemocratic measures to produce better governance. Not only does Jones provide provocative object-level examples, he teaches his reader to think about how alternative institutional procedures would compare to current ones. As has been argued in this magazine, America has routinely failed to undertake sufficient long-term strategic action in domains from state-led industrialization to AI to the arctic. Jones’ work provides a model for thinking about using institutional reforms to create a consistent strategic vision, something that has been a consistent weakness of liberal democracies.
>
> Caplan describes having once asked, “Why are democracies’ policies so bad?” After studying public opinion he began asking, “Why aren’t they much worse?” It is an untold story of our recent political and intellectual history just how widespread asking similar questions has become. There will almost certainly be no perfect solution or reform proposed, but as it becomes easier for nefarious agents to manipulate democratic processes by spreading misinformation and exacerbating political tensions, the need for reforms will become increasingly dire. After over a decade of increased skepticism about democracy, borne out not only in the academic literature but in the manifest failures of democratic politics, Jones’ concise and rigorous book suggests one possible path forward. Perhaps the great political question of the future will not be how to get to Denmark, but to Singapore." - [A Little Less Democracy, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/03/05/a-little-less-democracy/)

> "Every elite needs a story to legitimize its status. In secular democracies, where neither birth nor divine authority suffices, the search for legitimating mechanisms must operate in subtler, more opaque ways. Democratic elites are in constant self-denial, preserving privileges whose existence they cannot acknowledge in public. From the classroom to the boardroom, the ruling class has to adopt the language of egalitarianism while preventing its material realization.
>
> To fulfill both of these objectives at once, the American elite has built a stack of social technologies around the concept of meritocracy. On paper, every institution of elite production is accessible to all who deserve access. But the players who control the definition of merit and the metrics of achievement have evident incentives to limit the democratization of status. There lies the genius of meritocracy as we know it: the public mind does not grasp that a handful of institutions shape our perception of merit, that the selection processes change to protect dynastic privileges, and that meritocracy at-large consists of little more than a legitimating mechanism by and for elites. Dressed in the garb of equality, meritocracy allows hidden bastions of aristocracy to thrive in democratic societies." - [America’s Next Aristocracy, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/10/29/americas-next-aristocracy/)


> "America must be understood as a system of interwoven systems; the healthcare system sends a bill to a patient using the postal system, and that patient uses the mobile phone system to pay the bill with a credit card issued by the banking system. All these systems must be assumed to work for anyone to make even simple decisions. But the failure of one system has cascading consequences for all of the adjacent systems. As a consequence of escalating rates of failure, America’s complex systems are slowly collapsing.
>
> The core issue is that changing political mores have established the systematic promotion of the unqualified and sidelining of the competent. This has continually weakened our society’s ability to manage modern systems. At its inception, it represented a break from the trend of the 1920s to the 1960s, when the direct meritocratic evaluation of competence became the norm across vast swaths of American society.
>
> In the first decades of the twentieth century, the idea that individuals should be systematically evaluated and selected based on their ability rather than wealth, class, or political connections, led to significant changes in selection techniques at all levels of American society...
>
> By the 1960s, the systematic selection for competence came into direct conflict with the political imperatives of the civil rights movement. During the period from 1961 to 1972, a series of Supreme Court rulings, executive orders, and laws—most critically, the Civil Rights Act of 1964—put meritocracy and the new political imperative of protected-group diversity on a collision course. Administrative law judges have accepted statistically observable disparities in outcomes between groups as prima facie evidence of illegal discrimination. The result has been clear: any time meritocracy and diversity come into direct conflict, diversity must take priority.
>
> The resulting norms have steadily eroded institutional competency, causing America’s complex systems to fail with increasing regularity. In the language of a systems theorist, by decreasing the competency of the actors within the system, formerly stable systems have begun to experience normal accidents at a rate that is faster than the system can adapt. The prognosis is harsh but clear: either selection for competence will return or America will experience devolution to more primitive forms of civilization and loss of geopolitical power.
>
> The first domino to fall as civil rights-era policies took effect was the quantitative evaluation of competency by employers using straightforward cognitive batteries. While some tests are still legally used in hiring today, several high-profile enforcement actions against employers caused a wholesale change in the tools customarily usable by employers to screen for ability.
>
> After the early 1970s, employers responded by shifting from directly testing for ability to using the next best thing: a degree from a highly-selective university. By pushing the selection challenge to the college admissions offices, selective employers did two things: they reduced their risk of lawsuits and they turned the U.S. college application process into a highstakes war of all against all. Admission to Harvard would be a golden ticket to join the professional managerial class, while mere admission to a state school could mean a struggle to remain in the middle class.
>
> This outsourcing did not stave off the ideological change for long. Within the system of political imperatives now dominant in all major U.S. organizations, diversity must be prioritized even if there is a price in competency. The definition of diversity varies by industry and geography. In elite universities, diversity means black, indigenous, or Hispanic. In California, Indian women are diverse but Indian men are not. When selecting corporate board members, diversity means “anyone who is not a straight white man.” The legally protected and politically enforced nature of this imperative renders an open dialogue nearly impossible.
>
> However diversity itself is defined, most policy on the matter is based on a simple premise: since all groups are identical in talent, any unbiased process must produce the same group proportions as the general population, and therefore, processes that produce disproportionate outcomes must be biased. Prestigious journals like Harvard Business Review are the first to summarize and parrot these views, which then flow down to reporting by mass media organizations like Bloomberg Businessweek. Soon, it joins McKinsey’s “best practices” list and becomes instantiated in corporate policies.
>
> Unlike accounting policies, which emanate from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and are then implemented by Chief Financial Officers, the diversity push emanates inside of organizations from multiple power centers, each of which joins in for independent reasons. CEOs push diversity policies primarily to please board members and increase their status. Human Resources (HR) professionals push diversity policies primarily to avoid anti-discrimination lawsuits. Business development teams push diversity to win additional business from diversity-sensitive clients (e.g. government agencies). Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), such as the Black Googler Network, push diversity to help their in-group in hiring and promotion decisions." - [Complex Systems Won’t Survive the Competence Crisis, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/01/complex-systems-wont-survive-the-competence-crisis/)

if everyone has access to any part of the operations of anything - complete open source operations - and anyone could start contributing out in the open to anything and prove their competence - then there'd be a lot more objective ways to show if someone is better or more deserving than another and there'd be less room for accusations of bias and discrimination and less arguments for quotas
Instead of compromising on competence and meritocracy we should shift resources towards education and perhaps to greater degree those that are behind socioeconomically - aiming to even the starting position

# SECTION: Minimum Viable Superorganism
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████



> "Of all the remarkable things about our species... perhaps the most striking of all is our ability to band together and act as a united, coherent superorganism. **E pluribus unum**. From many, one. I don't mean anything particularly high-minded by "superorganism." It's just a fun way to refer to a cooperative enterprise. **Co-**, together + **operari**, work. Acting in concert. Coordinating individual behavior in pursuit of shared goals. Superorganisms, in this sense, include such mundane arrangements as law firms, soccer teams, city governments, and party planning committees. In fact, most of the groups we care about are superorganisms. A mere crowd, on the other hand, isn't a superorganism. It's just every man for himself — all **pluribus**, no **unum**...
>
> BUILDING A SUPERORGANISM
>
> First we'll need some basic building blocks, i.e., **individual organisms**... Now this is important: we have to assume that these individuals are entirely **self-interested** — that they don't fundamentally care about the superorganism (or any other individuals) unless it's somehow in their own interests. If we develop an architecture that doesn't serve its members' self-interest, it will inevitably break down as individuals realize they're better off not participating. On the other hand, if we develop an architecture ting all or most of its members, there's almost no end to what we'll be able to accomplish.
>
> Alright, now we need some reason for these selfish individuals to work together. Something they can accomplish more effectively as a team than as separate individuals... we need a **shared goal**.
>
> In some cases, the goal might be stated explicitly: "Let's do X!" But having an articulated goal is neither necessary nor sufficient. Many superorganisms manage to achieve goals without ever stating them explicitly. The Catholic Church, for example, amasses wealth and power as well as any superorganism, even though such goals aren't part of its official charter. And on the flip side, a superorganism can't impose a goal simply by fiat. A publicly-traded corporation is welcome to say that it wants to "make the world a better place," but when push comes to shove, the company will prioritize shareholder value, the rest of the world be damned.
>
> The more general case, then, is that a superorganism's goals must arise from **shared incentives**. When individual members of the superorganism would benefit (on net) by achieving X, then X becomes a de facto goal, regardless of whether it's officially articulated.
>
> ... This is not an academic objection. It's existential. Would-be superorganisms fall apart all the time due to the **free-rider problem**. Every failure to take collective action, every tragedy of the commons — including global climate change — arises because of the free-rider problem. It's the issue at the heart of every superorganism. "As we all know," writes Peter Turchin, "selfish agents will never cooperate to produce costly public goods. I think this mathematical result should have the status of 'the fundamental theorem of social sciences.'"
>
> And our task, remember, is to find the minimal technique that can overcome the free-rider problem. I'll tell you what isn't minimal: any kind of governance structure. The appeal of a government is that it can monitor and police everyone, rewarding hard workers and punishing slackers, thereby incentivizing each individual to cooperate. The problem is that it begs the question. For a government to act coherently, it needs to be a superorganism itself. And who will govern the governors? It's an infinite regress. Here's another technique that sounds promising. Suppose we have one member of the group who can effectively dominate everyone else. Let's call this the Strong Man architecture. Its appeal is that the Strong Man can be a government unto himself, no infinite regress required. Sounds great in theory, but in practice this architecture fails, because whenever one man is strong enough to rule by himself, he's better off expropriating his subjects rather than cajoling them to work together. The temptation to be a tyrant rather than a leader is just too great. (And why can't everyone else band together to resist his tyranny? Because then they would be acting as a superorganism. There's that damned infinite regress again.)
>
> ... Bottom line: I know of only one minimum viable architecture for turning individuals into a superorganism — for making sure it's in everyone's selfinterest to work together. I call it the **Prestige Economy**, and it runs on a deceptively simple rule: "Individuals should grant social status to others for advancing the superorganism's goals." That's it. That's the One Weird Trick that unlocks so much of our species' cooperative potential... notice how efficiently this solves the free-rider problem. In a Prestige Economy, people don't work hard because of the benefit they'll get when the superorganism achieves its goals (although it's a nice bonus), but rather because of the status they'll earn from their peers along the way. You're perfectly welcome to shirk your duties in a Prestige Economy — you just won't earn any kudos. And actually, if you shirk too much, others might be incentivized to notice and punish you, if in doing so they'll be perceived as advancing the superorganism's goals.
>
> ... Now, careful readers may have noticed something wrong with this architecture. In our attempt to solve one free-rider problem, we seem to have created another. Given a Prestige Economy, the issue is no longer how to incentivize people (or mice) to pursue the group's interest, but rather how to incentivize them to grant status to others for pursuing it.
>
> Here's the trouble: the act of celebrating a hero isn't entirely costless. It requires (a bit of) effort and sacrifice — buying the hero a drink, say, or throwing him a banquet. Point is, the hero's perks don't come out of thin air; they have to come from other individuals. And why should I bother to celebrate the hero, when I could just kick back and let the rest of you chumps celebrate him for me? I'll continue to reap the benefits of his heroic deeds, but it won't cost me a thing. At first this looks like yet another question-begging infinite regress. Another promising architecture spoiled by game theory. But Nature has one more trick up her sleeve, perhaps her most subtle and ingenious trick yet. Notice that, for humans, celebrating a hero doesn't feel like a costly act. We don't treat it like some annoying duty we're always looking for an excuse to get out of. In fact, we're happy and even eager to celebrate heroes. It just feels right and natural to us. And this kind of enthusiasm is the tell-tale sign of self-interest. Nature, then, has endowed us with the instinct to celebrate heroes because it ultimately benefits us to do so. Yes, it costs money to buy someone a drink, but we're getting something even more valuable in return: the chance to curry favor with a potential ally. And not just any ally, but one who has proven his worth, shown himself to be the kind of person who's useful to have on one's team. That's why it behooves me to cozy up to the hero. Not because I'm motivated to help provide a public good (status for the hero), but because I'm hoping to make a valuable friend. This is the magic of prestige status. From my perspective, I'm sucking up to the hero, hoping to cultivate an alliance. But from his perspective, my admiration is his reward. Ultimately, it's this pair of incentives — prestige and celebration, seeking status and currying favor — that binds a superorganism together.
>
> Of course there are other ways to seek (and win) prestige status, outside the context of a superorganism. You might write a PhD thesis, for example, or run a marathon, or learn to play the piano. These individual achievements play a similar role in making you more attractive as an ally. It's not that "helping a superorganism achieve its goals" is the only way to win prestige, just that it's a particularly good way.
>
> I should also note that "Prestige Economy" is only one way to formulate this idea. Other (refactored) formulations include competitive altruism, indirect reciprocity, enlightened self-interest, and the long literature on reputation. And reputation itself goes by many names and takes a variety of forms: honor, respect, status, prestige, karma, credit, esteem, even money. ("Money," as I wrote [elsewhere](https://twitter.com/KevinSimler/status/650336275954860033), "is industrial-grade prestige status.") These are all slightly different ways of looking at the same thing.
>
> To summarize, then, here's our recipe for a minimum viable superorganism: **"Selfish individuals pursuing shared goals (arising from shared underlying incentives), held together by a Prestige Economy which consists of two activities: (1) seeking status by attempting to advance the superorganism's goals, and (2) celebrating (i.e., sucking up to) those who deserve it."**

how stock options don't directly make people work harder for their direct monetary benefit but make a shared reputational incentive to work harder

> "Something similar happens when startups compensate their employees with stock options in addition to salary. The naive model says that startup employees work extra hard in order to make their options more valuable. But this is nonsense. Instead, stock options incentivize hard work by a more circuitous route. By granting options to all employees, the company ensures that everyone has a strong shared incentive in the success of the company, which then enables a Prestige Economy to develop. And at the end of the day (literally), it's prestige that keeps people toiling away at the office." - [Minimum Viable Superorganism, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/minimum-viable-superorganism/)

>
> In some ways, the industrial revolution cemented the prioritization of competence games over virtue games. We started caring much less about caste and social background, and caring much more about who can build the best bridge or the best internal combustion engine, etc. This meant that status became much more “liquid,” meaning you could rise or fall much more often according to your level of competence.

They often don’t have imposter syndrome, but you’d probably hate them if they said that aloud. Instead they wax poetic about how much they doubt themselves so they appear more relatable. This is also why successful people behave vulnerably in the public eye. Vulnerability makes unsuccessful people feel better by implying that the reason they didn’t make it is because of either bad luck or a biased society.

> Another example of this phenomena in action is charity: the act of giving signals both how rich/successful you are *and* how egalitarian you are. People want to be both extremely successful and extremely humble & charitable." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=True%20pros%20play,extremely%20humble%20%26%20charitable.)

> "Of course, one must pretend not to be playing these games while they play them. Paraphrasing Taleb: anything done with explicit intent to improve one’s status likely won’t improve one’s status. To admit to being motivated by a desire to improve ones’ rank is to risk making others think less of us, thus diminishing our rank. Even admitting this reality to ourselves can make us feel like our status has dropped. Even reading this piece has significantly lowered your status (kidding!)

> Which is why most people don’t even acknowledge status dynamics at all, even to themselves. For example, a friend once asked me why I tweet. When I told her it I do it for myself, not anyone else, she laughed. I meant it too. When I later asked her why she takes selfies on Instagram in a Bikini, she said she did it for herself, not anyone else. I laughed, realizing my answer must have sounded just as silly.

> Without even trying, we convince ourselves we aren’t seeking status, but of course we need it. Without it, we become depressed — even suicidal. Status is how we're wired to measure our worth. Why? We’re wired this way because we originally needed to be part of a tribe in order to survive. If you lost all of your status and were kicked out of your tribe, you died — which is why being “canceled” at the time meant you died, which explains why we dread it so much. People who experience a severe drop in status often become depressed or suicidal. Status isn’t enough to make us happy — since it’s a hamster wheel — but losing status most certainly makes us unhappy." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20one,makes%20us%20unhappy.)

> "So. How do we get out of the status rat race? 
>
> One path is to differentiate. Thanks to the internet, we’ve created a kazillion niches where people can attain status within their local tribe. One of the biggest gains of the internet that hasn’t been captured by GDP is how many new niches have been created in which you can become great and be recognized for it.

> Indeed: The best way to not be jealous of other people is to not compare yourself to them. The best way to stop comparing yourself to other people is to not compete with them. And the best way of avoiding competition is to do something only you can do." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=So.%20How%20do,can%20do.)

> "It’s very difficult to opt out of status games entirely. So another path is to just submit. Perhaps the only way out is through.

> Will Storr, in his book “[The Status Game](https://www.amazon.com/Status-Game-Position-Governs-Everything-ebook/dp/B08H7Y414K)”, recommends pursuing warmth, sincerity, and competence. When you're warm, you’re basically saying “I’m not going to play a dominance game with you and you're not going to receive any threats from me — you're in a safe place.” Similarly when you're sincere, you're saying “I'm going to be virtuous and not going to bullshit you. When things are going badly, I'm going to tell you. And lastly when you’re competent, you’re saying “I'm going to be useful. I've got a skill that’s useful to our game, and I can help you benefit from it and maybe even learn how to do it too.” One can analyze status dynamics in a million ways, but in some ways maybe it’s as simple as being warm, sincere, competent—and loyal." - [Status, Vulnerability, and Status Vulnerability, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/status-vulnerability-and-status-vulnerability#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20very%20difficult,competent%E2%80%94and%20loyal.)

> "We want people to think we’re virtuous—that’s a big incentive for us. But there’s a convoluted structure surrounding this incentive. We can only look virtuous by making it look like we weren’t trying to look virtuous. Which means that, to win the virtue game, we have to do all sorts of social maneuvering: we have to send “buried signals” of anonymous or inconspicuous altruism (to get credit for not caring about getting credit), show “modesty” or “humility” (to look morally superior to non-humble people), “bravely” defy social norms (to win the approval of our peers), and display our adherence to ethical principles independent of our self-interest (which is, ultimately, in our self-interest). It’s all very confusing." - [Incentives Are Everything, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/incentives-are-everything#:~:text=We%20want%20people,all%20very%20confusing.)





> "... ambiguous social hierarchies cause profound anxiety. And why wouldn’t they? Think about it: we’re social beings living in a social universe where all of our expectations upon life hinge on how we perceive and reconstruct social hierarchies. If there is unclarity around this, we never know if we might suddenly wake up tomorrow and be the beggar, the laughing stock, or just the bland loser nobody respects. We all want some kind of certainty to hold on to, to know what to expect, what to prepare ourselves for, to strive for." - [Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/neuroatypicality-is-the-shamanism-of-late-modernity/)
