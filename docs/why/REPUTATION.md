> "Noocracy ( where nous means 'wise' and kratos means 'rule' therefore 'rule of the wise' ) is a form of government where decision making is done by wise people. The idea is proposed by various philosophers such as [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha), [al-Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi) and [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius)." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Noocracy%20(/,and%20Confucius.)

> "The irrationality of voters inherent in democracies can be explained by two major behavioral and cognitive patterns. Firstly, most of the voters think that the marginal contribution of their vote will not make a difference on election outcomes; therefore, they do not find it useful to inform themselves on political matters. In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways. This psychological phenomenon causes voters to strongly identify themselves with a certain political group, specifically find evidence to support arguments aligning with their preferred ideological inclinations, and eventually vote with a high level of bias." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=The%20irrationality%20of,level%20of%20bias.)

> "Supporters of noocracy see a greater danger in the fact that politicians will actually prefer to implement the policy decisions of citizens to win elections and stabilize their power, without paying particular attention to the content and further outcomes of these policies. In democracies, the problem is that voters are prone to make bad policy decisions and therefore that politicians are incentivized to implement these policies due to personal benefits." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=supporters%20of%20noocracy,to%20personal%20benefits.)

> "Christiano proposes a ruling system based on division of political labor, in which citizens set the agenda for political discussions and determine the aims of the society, whereas legislators are in charge of deciding on the means to achieve these aims. For noocrats, transferring the decision-making mechanism to a body of specifically trained, specialized and experienced body is expected to result in superior and more efficient policy outcomes." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Christiano%20proposes%20a,efficient%20policy%20outcomes.)

> "Singapore has a political system that favors meritocracy; the path to government in Singapore is structured in such a way that only those with above-average skills are identified with strict university-entrance exams, recruiting processes, etc., and then rigorously trained to be able to devise best the solutions that benefit the entire society. In the words of the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth. This system primarily works due to citizens’ belief that political leaders tend to have a better understanding of country's long-term plans than themselves; therefore, as they see positive policy outcomes, they tend to go along with the system, rather than complain about the meritocratic dimensions." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Singapore%20has%20a,the%20meritocratic%20dimensions.)


> "Meritocracy is the notion of a political system in which economic goods or political power are vested in individual people based on ability and talent, rather than wealth or social class. Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement." - [Meritocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy#:~:text=Meritocracy%20(merit,or%20demonstrated%20achievement.)

> "In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "utilitarian" and "pragmatic", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people"." - [Meritocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy#:~:text=In%20a%20more,or%20able%20people%22.)

> "It is nowadays applied to merit-based systems of status and reward allocation in distinction to aristocratic or class-based systems, in which inherited factors are the primary determinant for the position of an individual in society." - [Meritocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy#:~:text=it%20is%20nowadays%20applied%20to%20merit%2Dbased%20systems%20of%20status%20and%20reward%20allocation%20in%20distinction%20to%20aristocratic%20or%20class%2Dbased%20systems%2C%20in%20which%20inherited%20factors%20are%20the%20primary%20determinant%20for%20the%20position%20of%20an%20individual%20in%20society.)


> "The most important ideas are likely to be the ideas that are most disruptive. What if the entire food pyramid, for example, was wildly off? What if fats were not the great danger we thought they were, and those waving fields of wheat that are fabled in American song, in fact, give rise to carbs, which are very dangerous to us all? So if everything were inverted, let’s say, where, in a world where instead of banishing volatility during the so-called Great Moderation before 2008, we were actually building the tinder for the world’s largest financial forest fire. What if, in fact, we had all sorts of things exactly backwards and completely wrong?" - [Eric Weinstein](https://theportal.group/18-eric-weinstein-solo-slipping-the-disc-state-of-the-portal-chapter-2020/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20ideas%20are,exactly%20backwards%20and%20completely%20wrong%3F)

> "We have effectively entered a period in which we cannot trust our experts. I think that what began as a desire to contribute and to do real work, ended with an understanding that we’ve got two generations of institutional experts that are corrupted, and that we cannot wake up from this crazy fever dream that we’re all in, because we can’t figure out who we can still trust.

Meritocracy can be computable and open-source
Meritocracy is the last revolution to be had
Meritocracy is true alignment and a prerequisite for consciousness
Meritocracy is a beautiful concept - the current implementation is what sucks


One big problem with meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy is that we've been unable to compute the reputation objectively for accountability. They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability. Proxies such as accreditation have proven bad.
Another criticism is one of lack of diversity and the superior results of the wisdom of crowds. But we can design a meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy however we like in order to maximize the collective intelligence of as many people as possible - it doesn't have to be a small clique of people that make all the contributions.
Also we can separate decision making from values & overall direction & goals so that we all get an equal vote for the values & direction.


> "What is a Meritocracy? The holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=What%20is%20a,of%20their%20ability.)

> "A meritocracy (in theory) is where we judge people on the basis of their individual abilities rather than their position in the social hierarchy or their family connections. For most of human history, we have not lived in anything resembling a meritocracy. Until recently, the most important institution in society was the family. You inherited your position and defined your identity as a member of a family. As a result, society was much more static than it is now. Social mobility was low, and all that mattered was who you knew. You didn’t get jobs on merit –  they were regarded as things that people owned and could pass down to their children. What meritocracy did was create a new kind of aristocracy. The only alternative to the aristocracy of land and inheritance was to replace it with an aristocracy of virtue and talent." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=A%20meritocracy%20(in,virtue%20and%20talent.)

> "The strongest criticism of meritocracy is not that there's something bad about the idea of putting the best people in charge. The critique is that the best people are not in charge... The ruling elite aren’t actually the best, they just got lucky or won thanks to kleptocracy." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20strongest%20criticism,thanks%20to%20kleptocracy.)

> "It was always tricky to discern talent and effort from parents and social class and environment. To unbundle what's in your control (merit) from what isn't (circumstance). Which leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the "best" & who "earns" it. In one sense it’s a fair process in that, in a successful meritocracy, whoever’s the best, should get it. But in another sense it’s unfair in that people didn’t get the same chance. Because of biological or cultural factors, or just sheer luck, not everyone had the same starting line. And this is the fatal flaw of the term meritocracy — it is about who wins the race but, in its quest to be fair, implies there’s an equal starting line." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=it%20was%20always,equal%20starting%20line.)

> "And if we don’t literally mean *equality* of opportunity, let’s just say “sufficient opportunity for all”, meaning we focus on constantly expanding absolute opportunity, without focusing on relative opportunity. Indeed, we should focus on expanding opportunity for all, we should focus on equal treatment under the law for all." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=And%20if%20we,law%20for%20all)

> "Everything you love is a result of inequality. When you seek a mate, do you want someone who is exactly average, just like everyone else, or do you want someone who is special? When you have kids, do you want them to have the same life outcomes as every other kid in the world, or do you want them to do better than that? When you have a job, do you aspire to turn in absolutely average performance, to be careful not to ever exceed the performance of your peers? Or do you aspire to do the best you can, even if that means you do better than your peers? Is it moral to want the best surgeon, the best teachers, or the best spouse to raise a family with?" - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Everything%20you%20love,a%20family%20with%3F)

> "Belief in an aristocracy of talent is self-fulfilling. If people believe the best people can rise up, and that effort impacts outcomes, they’ll work for it. Which is why threading this needle matters: The best people should be in charge, via a transparent process where anyone can prove they’re the best, but also accepting that people had different opportunities to begin with. In other words, we’re all running the same race, but at different starting lines. And that’s OK. Let’s try to move up everyone’s starting lines, without trying to hold anyone back, and more importantly, let’s try to maximize how far everyone can go." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Belief%20in%20an,everyone%20can%20go.)

> "The quality of a meritocracy is a product of (1) the team of people and (2) the way those people interact with each other. A meritocracy (and the business itself) is ultimately judged by its (3) outcomes (i.e., performance relative to goals). We spend time defining and measuring the effectiveness of our team and our interactions because we believe that they drive the outcomes on which the company depends directly and that they also drive our outcomes over the longer-term." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20quality%20of,the%20longer%2Dterm)

> "We are aiming for interactions that get the best out of individuals and the team, with truth and a deep desire to excel at their core. We think great leadership in this context is lots of “people in the arena”, meaning people who will relentlessly pursue truth wherever it takes them and who are totally unwilling to be on the sidelines. This means they are: (1) speaking up and exposing their honest thoughts and willing to be wrong, (2) unafraid to be transparent about their stumbles, imperfections, and decision-making and, (3) seeking to find the best ideas and get the most out of others through deliberate inclusion." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=We%20are%20aiming,through%20deliberate%20inclusion.)

> "The more unsure you are and the more assumptions you’re making, the more important it is to engage with curiosity rather than starting with assertions or certainty. In a meritocracy, greatness isn’t being the best debater, winning the most arguments, or personally having the right answer most often. It’s being honest about what you truly think while engaging with deep humility and the intent to learn, and in doing so increasing the probability of the team succeeding. Every member of the community has a responsibility to be honest and direct, and we expect a constant flow of feedback in all directions. It is most critical that feedback flow from those with less power to those with more, not because those with less power should bear the greatest burden, but because there are relatively more challenges to feedback moving in that direction — everything from power dynamics to frequency of interaction. In line with that everyone, but most especially leaders, has a responsibility not just to solicit honesty from others, but to assess whether that’s actually happening across all levels and if not, to diagnose why." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20more%20unsure,to%20diagnose%20why.)

> "Transparency includes everything from exposing the logic of decisions, to putting light on mistakes, to giving feedback publicly, and more. By and large, you should start from the place that more light is better." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=Transparency%20includes%20everything%20from%20exposing%20the%20logic%20of%20decisions%2C%20to%20putting%20light%20on%20mistakes%2C%20to%20giving%20feedback%20publicly%2C%20and%20more.%20By%20and%20large%2C%20you%20should%20start%20from%20the%20place%20that%20more%20light%20is%20better)

> "Focusing on outcomes increases the probability of a good design because it forces you to evaluate whether the team and interactions are sufficient to achieve what you want. It also creates more entrepreneurialism, innovation, and pushes people out on the risk curve as incentives align and teams come together and interact around a shared destination and value creation." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20outcomes,and%20value%20creation.)

Jim Rutt Show EP #32: Jason Brennan on Irrational Democracy & Academia
epistocracy !!!
Problems with democracy and voters:
- people disinterested in politics - not voting at all
- very low understanding of what is going on
- systematic misinformation - not just ignorance - ppl get the facts wrong
- different responses to political questions even after just 1 week without anything having changed - random answers
- partisanship, tribalism & confirmation (& disconfirmation) bias
- ignorance, apathy, irrationality
- no skin in the game
- position bias (pick the first thing, pay less attention to anything other than the 1st page, etc.)
- likeability - superficial features of candidates
- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

> "We have to ask ourselves what we think government is actually for. Some people think it has the value a painting has, which is to say that it’s symbolic. In that view, you might think, “We should have democracy because it’s a way of civilizing and expressing the idea that all of us have equal value.”
>
> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people. So if you think government is for that purpose, and I do, then you have to wonder if we should pick the form of government that best delivers the goods, whatever that might be." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20to,that%20might%20be.)

> "There was a time in British history ([from around 1600 until 1950](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-history-of-university-representation/)) where people who had college degrees would get an extra vote, but this was a stupid idea. It pains me to say this as an educator, but it turns out that university education has very little impact on how much people know. In general, college-educated people know more than non-college-educated people, but it’s not the college that’s making the difference." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=There%20was%20a,making%20the%20difference.)

> "Every kind of political system is abused, and we should guard against that. Here’s what I propose we do: Everyone can vote, even children. No one gets excluded. But when you vote, you do three things.
>
> First, you tell us what you want. You cast your vote for a politician, or for a party, or you take a position on a referendum, whatever it might be. Second, you tell us who you are. We get your demographic information, which is anonymously coded, because that stuff affects how you vote and what you support.And the third thing you do is take a quiz of very basic political knowledge. When we have those three bits of information, we can then statistically estimate what the public would have wanted if it was fully informed.
>
> Under this system, it’s not really the case that you have more power than I do. We can’t really point to any individual and say you were excluded, or your vote counted for more. The idea is to gauge what the public would actually want if it had all the information it needed." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=Every%20kind%20of,information%20it%20needed.)

> "Here’s my paradoxical-sounding idea: Let democracy decide what goes on the test." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=here%E2%80%99s%20my%20paradoxical%2Dsounding%20idea%3A%20Let%20democracy%20decide%20what%20goes%20on%20the%20test.)

> "If you survey people and ask them what it takes to be an informed voter, they say the same kinds of things I would say, but you quickly find out that many of them don’t know the answers... Voters know in the abstract what they ought to know; they just don’t actually know the things they think they should." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=If%20you%20survey,think%20they%20should.)

> "We have the right to choose our partner, to choose our religion, to choose what we’re going to eat, where we live, what job we’ll do, etc. While some of these things do impose costs on others, they’re primarily about carving out a sphere of autonomy for the individual, and about preventing other people from having control over you.
>
> A right to participate in politics seems fundamentally different because it involves imposing your will upon other people. So I’m not sure that any of us should have that kind of right, at least not without any responsibilities." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20the,without%20any%20responsibilities.)

> "This is a weird metaphor, but imagine I couldn’t move my arms because they were tied. But then you were to give me coffee whenever I wanted it. That’s kind of what’s going on in a democracy: I’m still getting the coffee, and that’s awesome, but I’m not actually responsible for the coffee getting into my mouth — you’re the one that’s doing it. No matter how you look at it, it’s really the group that has the power, not the individual, even if we’re in the group that has the power." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=This%20is%20a,has%20the%20power.)

>
> We might recognize that it’s better than anything else we’ve tried, and yet we can also see that there are all these persistent pathologies that exist, and so we should be asking, “How can we fix them?” We should be constantly experimenting and discovering what works and what doesn’t." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=I%20like%20to,and%20what%20doesn%E2%80%99t.)

> "Political scientists have long hoped to find an “invisible hand” in politics comparable to the one that Adam Smith described in economics. Voter ignorance wouldn’t matter much if a democracy were able to weave individual votes into collective political wisdom, the way a market weaves the self-interested buy-and-sell decisions of individual actors into a prudent collective allocation of resources. But, as Brennan reports, the mathematical models that have been proposed work only if voter ignorance has no shape of its own—if, for example, voters err on the side of liberalism as often as they err on the side of conservatism, leaving decisions in the hands of a politically knowledgeable minority in the center. Unfortunately, voter ignorance does seem to have a shape." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Political%20scientists%20have,have%20a%20shape.)

> I think if you take a few moments to look at the kind of behaviors that tracking those reputational elements would incent, you might see it’s a heck of a lot better than “feedback extortion” (Threatening to give negative feedback if you receive negative feedback)." - [Reputation is Orthogonal to Exchange, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2014/11/16/reputation-is-orthogonal-to-exchange#:~:text=Instead%20of%20a,receive%20negative%20feedback).)

> "Reputation should not be traded. Ever. That’s not what it is for. It is bound to an identity and is only meaningful when it continues to be bound to that identity. If I can buy or spend reputation rather than earning it by performing in the way the reputation currency indicates, then it is a meaningless signal that has broken loose from any sense that the reputation is supposed to impart." - [Avoid Blunders in Designing Reputation Systems, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2019/01/23/avoid-blunders-in-designing-reputation-systems#:~:text=Reputation%20should%20not,supposed%20to%20impart.)
