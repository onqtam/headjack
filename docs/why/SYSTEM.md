- Self-interest - human nature
- Meritocracy
- Responsibility & skin in the game
> "The amount of valuable information stuck in people’s heads about people, products, and companies that would influence investment decisions, purchasing decisions, and hiring/joining decisions is massive." - [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1746738383127503255)

hoarding information & profiting from it - example:
- a hedge fund gets early good information about an upcoming pandemic
- they try to make money by betting on a downturn (and they hope it's bad) and not share the info immediately to the public and try to build a good case to help steer policy such that the downturn isn't that high
What if the brightest minds were not in hedge funds but instead predicting in public what would happen and try to minimize the problems instead of hoarding the info of what's about to happen for maximum gain? What if helping the public brought bigger or at least comparable gains? We need to redefine status.

> "Is America a plutocracy? According to a 2014 study from Princeton University professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern University's Benjamin Page that examined close to 2,000 public opinion surveys, the answer may be yes. Gilens and Page found that while the opinions of everyday Americans rarely seemed to significantly influence decisions by Congress, those of the rich and interest groups did.

> In an ideal world... public support for an idea would more or less correlate with the probability of it becoming law. But the study found that public opinion pretty much hovers at a consistently low level of influence, regardless of how many citizens support or hate a proposal. But while average Americans seem increasingly unable to influence how they are actually governed, economic elites — the wealthy and influential — have a much greater chance of influencing legislators." - [Princeton Study Discovers What Our Politicians Really Think About Us](https://nypan.org/about/news-and-updates/2022/3/21/princeton-study-discovers-what-our-politicians-really-think-about-us#:~:text=Is%20America%20a,the%20chart%20below.)

> "Why is government around the world in the pocket of finance and big business? Because money in politics has allowed big money to hack the political system." - [In Search of the 5th Attractor, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/fifth-attractor-6d1a54fcda2e#:~:text=Why%20is%20government%20around%20the%20world%20in%20the%20pocket%20of%20finance%20and%20big%20business%3F%20Because%20money%20in%20politics%20has%20allowed%20big%20money%20to%20hack%20the%20political%20system.)

> "We used to have a control mechanism: the will of the people as expressed through political institutions. That served as a restraint on run-away financialization and other forms of exploitation by big money. The system now has no self-restraint; it’s an out-of-control machine only optimizing on short-term money-on-money return. What is the result? Systemic fragility." - [In Search of the 5th Attractor, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/fifth-attractor-6d1a54fcda2e#:~:text=We%20used%20to%20have%20a%20control,What%20is%20the%20result%3F%20Systemic%20fragility.)

> "The first couple of things that need to be done are to break the power of money in politics. That’s job one; without that, the rest of it’s impossible. And then build restraints back into the economic system. I’m not a person who speaks against the market; the market is actually a brilliant invention that creates many semi-equilibria that interoperate without much top-down decision making. It is the most effective platform found so far for real-time information sharing through the mechanism of pricing. Run correctly, it’s like a furnace that can heat our house. But the way we’re currently operating our economic system, we’ve let the fire out of the furnace, and it’s burning the house down. It’ll probably burn the whole neighborhood down if we don’t do something about it." - [In Search of the 5th Attractor, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/fifth-attractor-6d1a54fcda2e#:~:text=The%20first%20couple,something%20about%20it.)

> "Following the example of autoimmune diseases, the main cause of warfare is a misidentification, i.e. perceiving a fellow cell within humanity as the Other. Although the actors of war are political organizations (following Levy & Thompson’s definition of war), individuals are the ones who do the actual fighting to advance the interests of the leadership of a particular political organization. In the case of warfare, the interest of the leadership and the fighting individuals rarely correlate. Consequently, the political elite must convince the public that liquidating fellow cells within the collective body is the only option left to resolve an ongoing conflict. Here ideology plays the most crucial role. State ideology is disseminated to the people via various propaganda organs. The false framework of “us vs. them” is established by magnifying the differences between human beings (race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, political opinion, membership of a particular social group etc.) while willfully ignoring the fact that we are equally important and valuable cells within humanity. Divide et impera (“divide and conquer”) is an ancient Latin maxim that was widely used in every historical era. In the twentieth and twenty-first century we witnessed narratives based on binary opposites such as Aryan vs. Jew (World War II), communist vs. capitalist (Cold War) and terrorist vs. peace-loving citizen (War on Terror). Creating an image of the enemy (the Other) and instilling fear in the public are classic examples of the propaganda machine specifically designed to manufacture an ideology based on division." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "The healthy state of humanity is peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Although the increasing destructiveness of military technology reduced the incentives of major powers to fight large-scale wars, we still see significant amount of warfare in the world. These developments suggest that the general quality of consciousness of humanity is rather low. Identifying a fellow cell as an enemy because it lives in another organ (cf. nationality), looks like a red blood cell instead of a white one (cf. race), believes in the heart instead of the brain (cf. religion), and follows the kidney instead of the gall bladder (cf. political affiliation), is not the characteristic of an efficient, well-organized, low-entropy system. I suggest that the top-down approach toward peaceful coexistence does not work as the failure of the Kellogg-Briand pact (1928) demonstrated. The potentially more effective bottom-up design (eradicating ignorance one person at a time by identifying the Other as an equal unit within the collective body) may lead to a quantum leap in the consciousness of humanity that will result in – among others – the total absence of warfare based on the realization of our interconnectedness and essential oneness. The reason why the so-called Golden Rule of every major world religion stipulates to treat others the way we would like to be treated is because every individuated unit is part of the whole (i.e. humanity, and ultimately, the Self). Given that the Self (the Absolute that is commonly referred to as Tao in Taoism, Brahman in Hinduism, God in Christianity, Yahweh in Judaism and Allah in Islam) consists of everything and everybody (the four elements, the mineral kingdom, the plant kingdom, the animal kingdom and the human kingdom), harming the Other is literally harming the Self – myself. The only possible explanation behind damaging the Other is the lack of recognition that there is no Other: everything and everybody is part of the Self." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)

> "Immense financial, natural and human resources are directed at warfare, even though one trivial realization on a mass scale would result in the total cessation of all hostilities. This realization is that every Other (the so-called “enemy”) is in actuality a fellow cell, because regardless of the superficial differences these very units comprise the living organism we call humanity. The healthy, peaceful, cooperative state of humanity needs to be every responsible human being’s concern." - [War as the Autoimmune Disease of Humanity: Perspectives on a Theoretical Proposal](https://www.globalpoliticsreview.com/publications/2464-9929_v02_i01_p11.pdf)
