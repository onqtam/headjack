Capitalism as alignment 1.0 - What’s its essence?
- Collective intelligence
- Competition and evolution
- Self-interest - human nature
- Meritocracy
- Responsibility & skin in the game
> "The amount of valuable information stuck in people’s heads about people, products, and companies that would influence investment decisions, purchasing decisions, and hiring/joining decisions is massive." - [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1746738383127503255)

hoarding information & profiting from it - example:
- a hedge fund gets early good information about an upcoming pandemic
- they try to make money by betting on a downturn (and they hope it's bad) and not share the info immediately to the public and try to build a good case to help steer policy such that the downturn isn't that high
What if the brightest minds were not in hedge funds but instead predicting in public what would happen and try to minimize the problems instead of hoarding the info of what's about to happen for maximum gain? What if helping the public brought bigger or at least comparable gains? We need to redefine status.

"I think that most capitalists don’t know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists don’t know how to grow it well, yet we are now at a juncture in which either a) people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re-engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b) we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie." - [Ray Dalio](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-how-capitalism-needs-reformed-parts-1-2-ray-dalio/#:~:text=I%20think%20that,shrink%20the%20pie.)

When the world around you is changing, and that change is accelerating, the question is never whether to change or stay the same. The questions we must confront are: 1) What changes are vital? (to survival and goals), and 2) How do we implement those changes in a way that doesn’t destroy the integrity of what works? Selecting a conservative vs. a progressive candidate is a false choice that we are forced to make because of broken architectures of governments." - [The Future of Governance is not Governments, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2017/01/26/future-governance-is-not-governments#:~:text=Globally%2C%20politics%20polarizes,architectures%20of%20governments.)

> "Is America a plutocracy? According to a 2014 study from Princeton University professor Martin Gilens and Northwestern University's Benjamin Page that examined close to 2,000 public opinion surveys, the answer may be yes. Gilens and Page found that while the opinions of everyday Americans rarely seemed to significantly influence decisions by Congress, those of the rich and interest groups did.

> In an ideal world... public support for an idea would more or less correlate with the probability of it becoming law. But the study found that public opinion pretty much hovers at a consistently low level of influence, regardless of how many citizens support or hate a proposal. But while average Americans seem increasingly unable to influence how they are actually governed, economic elites — the wealthy and influential — have a much greater chance of influencing legislators." - [Princeton Study Discovers What Our Politicians Really Think About Us](https://nypan.org/about/news-and-updates/2022/3/21/princeton-study-discovers-what-our-politicians-really-think-about-us#:~:text=Is%20America%20a,the%20chart%20below.)
