> "The amount of valuable information stuck in people’s heads about people, products, and companies that would influence investment decisions, purchasing decisions, and hiring/joining decisions is massive." - [Erik Torenberg](https://twitter.com/eriktorenberg/status/1746738383127503255)

hoarding information & profiting from it - example:
- a hedge fund gets early good information about an upcoming pandemic
- they try to make money by betting on a downturn (and they hope it's bad) and not share the info immediately to the public and try to build a good case to help steer policy such that the downturn isn't that high
What if the brightest minds were not in hedge funds but instead predicting in public what would happen and try to minimize the problems instead of hoarding the info of what's about to happen for maximum gain? What if helping the public brought bigger or at least comparable gains? We need to redefine status.

> "Globally, politics polarizes around that tension: conservative vs. progressive. This is a false choice. Both are mandatory. It doesn’t matter whether we like it or not. When the world around you is changing, and that change is accelerating, the question is never whether to change or stay the same. The questions we must confront are: 1) What changes are vital? (to survival and goals), and 2) How do we implement those changes in a way that doesn’t destroy the integrity of what works? Selecting a conservative vs. a progressive candidate is a false choice that we are forced to make because of broken architectures of governments." - [The Future of Governance is not Governments, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2017/01/26/future-governance-is-not-governments#:~:text=Globally%2C%20politics%20polarizes,architectures%20of%20governments.)

> "We have politicians without the right expertise, with inherent conflicts of interest by who they have please to keep getting campaign funds, who can’t possibly represent the complexity of their constituency, and are elected by association with ideological simplifications … and we pretend there’s a chance of good governance from this setup." - [The Future of Governance is not Governments, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2017/01/26/future-governance-is-not-governments#:~:text=We%20have%20politicians,from%20this%20setup.)

> "We have to oversimplify issues for people to understand them. Our reasoning is impaired by hundreds of cognitive biases. We say and do things to be accepted by our peers and groups, and let our need for acceptance or preoccupation with immediate desires overshadow our ability to perceive things rationally. We’ve been perfecting the manipulation of people using human irrationality for many decades. Advertising firms use it to make you buy junk. Political campaigns use it to alienate you from opponents, or mobilize people with angering ballot initiatives." - [Challenging Broken Assumptions of Governance, by Arthur Brock](https://www.artbrock.com/2017/02/11/challenging-broken-assumptions-of-governance#:~:text=We%20have%20to,angering%20ballot%20initiatives.)

What if we did to mass consumer product packaging what the container did to shipping? How do we reuse our packaging more - even across companies & their product lineups?
Convenience packaging... replacing a depositing system and reusable bottles (deposit 40% of a coke bottle which u get back when u return the bottle)
reclamation costs have been outsourced to the public in the form of "recycling"

Coke Knew Their Plastic Would Trash the Planet…And Did It Anyway

why do they make packaging that's impossible to reuse/recycle and is composed of multiple different types of material?
