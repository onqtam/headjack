Accordingly, we plan for everything: social events, marriage, education, vacations, careers, health, war and even death. So why don’t we have a plan for the human race? Whether we like it or not, nearly 8 billion of us are interconnected, comprising a vast orchestra, each contributing to a collective fate." - [13 Steps to Cognitive “Perfection”, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/13-steps-to-cognitive-perfection-86e316569c3f#:~:text=Because%20of%20the,a%20collective%20fate.)

A scientific-yet-spiritual worldview that unites us all under a common existential goal: the continued existence of life, consciousness, and creativity in the universe. Our intelligence makes our species uniquely responsible for seeing that life continues to survive, because to survive it must ultimately get off the planet before the sun explodes (or otherwise becomes uninhabitable).

> Evolutionary speaking, a worldview is a strategy for collective survival. That is, it is a blueprint for a stable society, in much the same way that a genome is a blueprint for a stable organism, and a strategy for individual survival. Cognitively speaking, a worldview is a “sense-making lens,” because its function is to make sense of a complicated and confusing reality. As knowledge systems, worldviews aim to reduce our uncertainty about the world in an attempt to minimize anxiety and cognitive dissonance. Simply stated, they tell us what to do and why.

> Worldviews are an important part of the evolutionary process because they facilitate the emergence of a social organism—an organism made of intelligent organisms—by aligning the interests of interacting agents and harmonizing their activities.

According to this framework, life will come and go without making any significant difference to the universe at large.

> "The universe no longer appears to just be this big random machine evolving arbitrarily, but instead a creative system that is recursively generating novelty, pattern, and experience—perhaps endlessly. In other words, reality is an emergence generator. So far, it has produced matter, life, mind, and culture through a process of hierarchical self-organization, whereby nature’s fundamental components come together to form greater wholes, which then become the building blocks for the next level of complexity. Subatomic particles came together to form atoms, which came together to form molecules, which formed cells, which formed complex organisms, which formed societies, and human civilization now seems to be forming what has been described as a “global brain.” Could this global brain of humans informationally connected by wireless devices someday become conscious? We can only speculate about what kind of emergences are in store for our civilization should we collectively choose to consciously participate in the process of cosmic evolution that life seems to be such a crucial part of.
>
> Although this paradigm is completely naturalistic, many will find its philosophical implications to have a spiritual quality because they suggest that life has cosmic significance. By “cosmic significance,” I mean that life is a mechanism for the growth of complexity in nature that will shape the evolutionary trajectory of the universe and determine its large-scale development. And if biologically-based intelligence is the primary driver of cosmic evolution, then life has objective significance and a somewhat mysterious purpose that transcends the individual.
>
> If this emerging paradigm—which can be called the paradigm of emergence—suggests that life does in fact have cosmic significance and is not destined for transience, then that is a discovery that must be shouted from the rooftops. One could argue that it is a more profound paradigm shift than those associated with Newton and Darwin, because it places life at the center of everything, though It is actually an extension of the Darwinian paradigm, as it applies evolutionary logic to every scale of organization in nature, including the cosmos as a single system.
>
> Not only would delivering this information have positive effects on the mental health of all the science-minded people who have accepted a nihilistic philosophy for no good reason, it would also be of great practical importance to society, because the new cosmic narrative illuminates not just why we are here, but where we’re going and how to get there. Simply stated, the paradigm of emergence provides a road map for human progress.

In recent decades, the nihilism of postmodernism has added another layer of complexity and confusion to the scientific discourse, casting doubt on the very foundations of knowledge and truth. As we grapple with the challenges of the 21st century, a new scientific and philosophical paradigm is urgently needed—one that transcends the limitations of both reductionism and postmodernism, while retaining their contributions to our understanding of the world." - [Poetic Meta-Naturalism: A New Philosophy of Reality for the Metamodern Age](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/poetic-meta-naturalism-a-new-philosophy#:~:text=The%20scientific%20landscape,of%20the%20world.)

It has to be if we want our civilization to survive. Under the cosmic perspective, there is no “us versus them,” there’s only “we.” Since we’re all part of an interdependent whole, our goal should be to try to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

> "Our primary collective goal should be hyperconnection. Every year the number of ways to socially connect with others, even those in the most remote locations, increases exponentially, allowing for ever-greater information flow. This inevitably promotes greater social awareness and knowledge exchange. It is also a mathematical fact that increasing the number of connections between nodes increases the computational power of a network. If human civilization really is one massive neural network now, with each individual and device acting as a node or neuron, then that means social media has the ability to create some powerful network effects. We must utilize all the tools of the information age — and invent new ones. The power of blockchain technology to facilitate the emergence of self-organizing systems of all types is just beginning to be explored." - [Why Carl Sagan believed that science is a source of spirituality, by Bobby Azarian](https://bigthink.com/thinking/why-carl-sagan-believed-that-science-is-a-source-of-spirituality/#:~:text=Our%20primary%20collective,to%20be%20explored.)

We need a worldview that aligns our interests because if it has immediate practical benefits, like financial benefits, people in need will adopt it. We may call this worldview that I am describing “the Cosmic Perspective.” Under the Cosmic Perspective, there is no “us versus them,” there’s only “we.” We’re all part of an interdependent whole, and we need leaders who understand this view—who make decisions and policy based on data, who put empiricism above rigid ideology and dogma, and who try to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people." - [Could a "Cosmic Religion" Unite a Divided Nation?, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mind-in-the-machine/202006/could-cosmic-religion-unite-divided-nation#:~:text=The%20real%20existential,number%20of%20people.)

In other words, nature’s simplest parts organize themselves into wholes, which become the building blocks for the next level of complexity. Atoms come together to form molecules, which come together to form cells, which come together to form complex organisms that self-assemble into societies.

> "If life is a natural manifestation of physical law rather than an improbable fluke, then the new cosmic narrative has spiritual implications. We are not a cosmic accident; we are a cosmic imperative. The universe is self-organizing and self-actualizing, but it cannot achieve such aims on its own. Curiously, it needs the help of humble mortals. This gives humanity a collective purpose: to assist the universe in its great awakening by ensuring that life persists. To see to it that this process is realized, we must overcome existential challenges by aligning our interests, which promotes cooperation and minimizes conflict. The new cosmic narrative creates an ethical, economic, and political philosophy that has the power to unify us in these divided times. Raising awareness of our emergent cosmic purpose could accelerate social, moral, and technological progress, allowing us to transcend our intrinsic limitations, and the biosphere to extend outward, into the heavens." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/romance-reality-universe-organizes-create-life-consciousness-cosmic-complexity-bookbite/35458/#:~:text=If%20life%20is,into%20the%20heavens.)

We must recognize that we are part of an interdependent, interconnected whole, and we must make decisions that are consistent with the goals of civilization. If we do not become cognizant that the only way to overcome existential challenges is by working together, then human civilization will fail, and those that come after us will get their chance." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://nextbigideaclub.com/magazine/romance-reality-universe-organizes-create-life-consciousness-cosmic-complexity-bookbite/35458/#:~:text=Recognizing%20that%20we,get%20their%20chance.)

> "A thing X will be perceived as meaningful in context C to the extent that it's connected to other meaningful things in C... what kind of connections are we talking about? Typically they will be causal: X influences Y. Sometimes they will be epistemic: X justifies or explains Y. But they might also be narrative connections or even mere coincidences. Regardless, the more densely or strongly connected something is to the rest of the meaning "soup," the more meaningful it will be perceived to be... So the more arrows issuing out from something, the greater its meaning.

> We can also gauge meaning by asking the counterfactual question: "How much of an effect would removing X from C have on the other meaningful things in C?" The greater the effect, the more the meaning." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=A%20thing%20X,more%20the%20meaning.)

https://meltingasphalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/high_vs_low_meaning.png

> "If meaning is about connectedness, and especially causal influence, we can see why it's adaptive to pursue meaning. Perceptions of meaning allow us to answer a question we're always asking ourselves, "Why am I bothering to do this?" If an activity feels meaningful, it merits our continued attention and investment. Whereas if it feels meaningless, an appropriate response is to stop doing it — to give up and search for a more meaningful path. To seek meaning, then, helps us avoid dead-ends and retain control over our lives. Just as boredom and ennui are emotions that prompt us to make better use of our time or to look for other opportunities, our perceptions of meaning (or lack thereof) prompt us to think about the deepest, longest-term impact of our actions, and to steer toward better outcomes." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=if%20meaning%20is,toward%20better%20outcomes.)

> "What does matter, as they say, "in the grand scheme of things"? It might be helpful to think in extremes. The least meaningful life, for example, is the causal dead-end — a person so inessential and irrelevant that the world doesn't so much as bat an eyelash when they die. A hermit who spends his whole life alone in the woods, perhaps. Or someone who toils in utter obscurity, leaving no children and no other mark on the world. On the other hand, the most meaningful life is the one on which everything depends: the fate of humanity, Good triumphing over Evil, etc." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=what%20does%20matter,over%20Evil%2C%20etc.)

> "If meaning is pointing, then the meaning of one's life must reside in the arrows that point outward from it, influencing the external world. That's why we so often talk about meaningful activities in generic terms like "connecting with others," "paying it forward," "having an impact," "leaving a legacy," or participating in something "bigger than oneself." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=if%20meaning%20is%20pointing,something%20%22bigger%20than%20oneself.%22)

In other words, you'll feel a dearth of meaning. Karl Marx called it [alienation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation), the way the industrial era disconnects its workers from reliable sources of meaning. This happens especially but not exclusively in factories, where workers are disconnected from the final product, from other workers, and from consumers." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=If%20your%20work%20is%20low,other%20workers%2C%20and%20from%20consumers.)

The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.

Nietzsche believed that the correct path was not to avoid nihilism or to accept it as an end state, but rather to pass through nihilism as a necessary stepping stone on the way to something better.

TODO: quote from here (from a teacher in NY) about how broken public schooling is
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw
Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast
from minute 9:44 till 13:05

Its all about education - it never stops - not just 24 years - for life. For anything. At any time.

What if school work was not something that ends up thrown away but was aimed at contributing to society? What if all their work was meaningful and not thrown away once graded? They feel like their work is pointless & ineffectual. They're forced into non-seriousness. We're creating a kind of immaturity. (All thoughts from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast)

Harvard is a perverse concept

One upside of having kids learn & compete on serious real world issues in public building a track record is that by the time they're 25-30 they'll have more to show and prove than most 40-50 year olds and could make a serious claim to legitimacy in governance - a way to fix our gerintocracy.

The root of the metacrisis is an education crisis (Zak Stein)
also a legitimation & teacherly authority crisis - its not just a technological problem
Education is the autopoietic root of society - the way it propagates/maintains/reproduces itself

> "The question is not, Does or doesn't public schooling create a public? The question is, What kind of public does it create? A conglomerate of self-indulgent consumers? Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools. The right answer depends on two things, and two things alone: the existence of shared narratives and the capacity of such narratives to provide an inspired reason for schooling." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1364209-public-education-does-not-serve-a-public-it-creates-a#:~:text=The%20question%20is,reason%20for%20schooling.)

>
> Because our new elites are foxes and not lions, they no longer feel comfortable celebrating productive habits for the rest of society.

> Our old elites used to share a sense of common responsibility and noblesse oblige — not just to give back, but to expect the masses to act in a way that would let them rise up as well. Old elites knew that on average they had more productive habits than the masses (e.g. marital fidelity, two-parent households, steady employment, etc), and so it was thus their job to provide the masses an example to aspire to.
>
> But our new elites are less likely to admit they’re more productive; if anything, they deny it. While this humility seems generous on the surface — it’s nicer to imply that elites are successful solely because of privilege and not also because they’re more productive — this also denies the elites of any responsibility to the masses.
>
> To be sure, new elites do recognize their privilege, but this only necessitates that they give resources, not that they also need to transmit the right habits.

Out of that life come eukaryotes—nucleated cells—and then complex colonies of cells.

This is very profound, because... if in fact the conservation and complexification of novelty is what the universe is striving for, then, suddenly, our own human enterprise — previously marginalized — takes on an immense new importance.

Religions are literally false but metaphorically true - Brett Weinstein
What if we could make a literally true one?

God’s message to humanity:
Show me what you’ve gooot - from rick & morty

We all want to be loved and connected - we are religious beings. And what if we weren’t monotheistic - what if we were polytheistic and there were many gods of competence and judgement for different aspects of the world? What if the god protocol enabled anyone to become a god of something - depending on their specialty?
What is our god mobility? How easy is it to earn the status of a god through proven competence?

God is (in) our common humanity
The fairness protocol as god
The god protocol is about fairness and consent
God is an attractor that pulls us towards becoming him - with transcendence as his offering

For the first time in human history God could speak to us and we could objectively hear him and have a connection with him.
Imagine talking genuinely to the essence of your social system

God is the intersection of truth beauty and love

Evolving God one weight/computation at a time

The god machine - stacked layers of incentives and weights
Picture the god machine and how the root has the most impact in where the whip goes

What if we could choose cooperation as our god? And implemented incentives around identity such that the better and more you cooperate with others and contribute to society, the higher your status gets - closer to becoming god himsef?

God will be the pyramid of the 21st century or third millenium

God is the participatory protocol of cooperative rules for engagement that we need to construct in order to transcend 

This is the social protocol
Cooperation, transparency, immutability
God

We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?

God was always trending/leaning towards what we needed him to be and what was achievable given the civilizational path dependence. The enlightenment and the industrial revolution have given us orders of magnitude more knowledge about the world and its time to use all that and define the next version of god

To be in the presence of god is to be engaged in the most win-win game possible

The evolution of god shows us how god is usually the point towards which we’re aiming at
God is consciousness - god is matter knowing itself and managing to command itself - god is attention - god is phenomenology - as a process god is experience

God is the solution for us going through this evolutionary bottleneck - god is survivability - god is life - god is meaning

> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

> "Society in general, simply by its effect on men's minds, undoubtedly has all that is required to arouse the sensation of the divine. A society is to its members what a god is to its faithful.

In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1204111)

> "Society is not a mere sum of individuals. Rather, the system formed by their association represents a specific reality which has its own characteristics... The group thinks, feels, and acts quite differently from the way in which its members would were they isolated. If, then, we begin with the individual, we shall be able to understand nothing of what takes place in the group." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/541413)

> "Man is only a moral being because he lives in society, since morality consists in solidarity with the group, and varies according to that solidarity.

OMEGA POINT STUFF BY BOBBY AZARIAN GOES HERE

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

> "The universe began about fifteen billion years ago, in almost absolute simplicity, and it's been getting more and more complex ever since. This movement from the simple to the complex is built into the web and weave of the universe, and it's called the tendency toward complexity. We're the products of this complexification, and so are the birds, and the bees, and the trees, and the stars, and even the galaxies of stars. ... Okay, the final or ultimate complexity - the place where all this complexity is going - is what, or who, we might call God. And anything that promotes, enhances, or accelerates this movement toward God is good. Anything that inhibits, impedes, or prevents it is evil." - [Gregory David Roberts](https://www.consciousevolution.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-meaning-of-life#:~:text=The%20universe%20began,it%20is%20evil.)

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

God is leaving the world better after yourself

> "Syntheism is essentially idea that God is a good word to use, because God is the ultimate. And we have no better word for the ultimate. So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

> "Our point in offering this obviously oversimplified history is that our understanding of Religion today is very different from what it has been through the vast majority of human life. The problems this difference has led to are the key point of our blog. For most of human history, Religion was not merely a matter of worshipping supernatural gods. Rather, it provided what historian David Christian calls, in his book Origin Stories, a “shared map,” the myth by which members of a community could navigate our “rich, beautiful and sometimes terrifying universe.”
>
> This map enabled both individuals and societies to take on tasks such as developing a shared interpretation of the world, a common identity, and a set of behavioral standards. In fact, it was so deeply integrated into society that the first pre-modern scientists—the astronomers of Babylon and Egypt—were priests. “Religion” was not separate from the rest of social behavior; it provided the compass for that behavior." - [What Is Religion?

> "To understand what we mean by mythos, we need to examine how the human brain organizes conscious experience around a symbolic order. Terrence Deacon calls this ordering the “defining attribute of human beings.” That symbolic order enables people in any community to interpret their world so that they can cooperate in meeting the deepest challenges to their survival. As a result, culture creates a shared virtual reality. The beliefs and values of any community emerge from their symbolic order, and, especially in pre-literate societies, that order is communicated in its mythos." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=To%20understand%20what,its%20mythos.)

> "People need a structure of understanding to explain both why things are the way they are and what is the right way to live, which are implied in their symbolic orders. As a result, they face at least two fundamental challenges—justifying what is the case and justifying what ought to be the case. We can call the first the problem of facts and the second the problem of values." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=people%20need%20a,problem%20of%20values.)

> "We can frame religion in terms of the belief-value networks that emerge from our symbolic orders and shape how we see and experience value in the universe, in our collective groups, and in our personal lives. It relates to what binds us together in a story, what gives meaningful shape to the cosmos, and what places us in a network with others that enables us to determine what is sacred or transcendent.
>
> This analysis allows us to see clearly why we are facing something of a meaning crisis, especially in the West. In concrete terms, the Christian justification system that emerged in Europe developed both a theistic Religion and a natural philosophy. However, as the natural philosophy grew into natural science, it generated a justification system that undermined a theistic worldview and its dual worlds of heaven and earth. Instead, what we were left with via science was a fairly cold description of “what is,” and essentially no justification system for what ought to be.
>
> We believe that humans need to have coherent justifications for both what is the case and what ought to be the case. We can see through the Greek terms “logos” and “mythos” that these are two different kinds of justifications, but we need them both. Science has given us a good way to develop our logos. However, it has not been framed in a way that also is conducive to cultivating a mythos that gives us a shared narrative for how we ought to live in the world. We believe this is one of the great tasks of this century." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=we%20can%20frame,of%20this%20century.)

> "A more interesting framing of religion is to view it as the fabric that ties society together. And what tied traditional societies of a distant past together obviously won’t be able to take on that role today. However, weaving this shared social fabric of religion may be the only way we know of to organise society past the Dunbar number. A broader definition of religion would also include our stories about technology, art, nation states, etc. Geertz defines religion as a “system of symbols which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in society”.
>
> Any widely shared beliefs, stories, and practices could be conceived of as religious in this broader definition that we are considering here. From trust in the institution of science to the story of progress through globalisation to the ritual of accepting printed paper for goods - it’s all religious in this broader framing.
>
> Layman Pascal proposes that religion is fundamentally about the harmonisation and integration of culture, technology, politics, etc. at a given time and place. If this religious integration is successful, it results in an excess of meaning and coherence that can translate into a numinous experience that binds communities together. From this point of view, religion stops seeming like an antiquated mode of superstition. Rather, the emergence of a religion that creates a right integration and surplus coherence for our times suddenly seems like an urgent priority.
>
> Old Friedrich declared the death of God more than 140 years ago. And the damn corps has been rotting for so long that we can no longer ignore the stench. As social animals that relate to the world and each other through justifications, it seems like we need a narrative that gives purpose to our lives. Yet more and more find it impossible to believe the silly dogmas of the cultural fossils we generally call “religion”, or to participate in their dead rituals. This is neither an apology for ancient superstitions nor an attempt to resurrect Skydaddy, but we have to admit that there is a gaping hole that these relics used to fill for our ancestors.

> Some might argue that Capital has become our new God - a delicious throwback to the biblical golden calf. A more encompassing diagnosis would be that we ourselves have taken on the role of God in the advent of humanism. Anthropos on the throne, Mammon (Capital & markets) to his right, and Scientia to her left. Seems fitting, since humans are now literally the force shaping our planet (Anthropocene, etc.). Homo Deus wields weapons many orders of magnitude more powerful than what the Gods of old could dream of. Little Boy makes Thor’s hammer and Zeus’ lightning look like Nerf guns. Armageddon is just an autocrat with a big red button away.

>
> 1. It needs to provide a sense of personal and shared meaning. This includes moral and ontological frameworks that provide orientation in the world.

The simulation hypothesis is just tech bro gnosticism. The Omega point and the singularity are Silicon Valley eschatology. Cosmological inflation, complexification, quantum entanglement, many worlds. Many words. And all of them have religious implications and offer competing grand narratives, whether their pundits admit it or not. Many of them tie in with great religious traditions and philosophers alike (Hegel, Whitehead, Bergson, de Chardin). A re-integration therefore does not seem out of reach, and we will continue to see more convincing attempts. The prototypical example is Wilber’s Integralism, and more recently, Metamodernism. Interesting attempts that focus even more on the narrative aspects continue to show up, e.g. Emergentism or The Romance of Reality.

Daniel Görtz describes this concept of a headless God as follows: “It is a God whose altar can be pissed upon, is insulted again and again, yet remains sacred, is resurrected. (...) Always on its way to the guillotine.” This allows for an anti- fragile dynamic where whatever belief structures are left after ferocious critique can be believed in with much more conviction. This constant critique also acts as a pruning function to get rid of structures no longer needed. Since our God is anti- fragile, there should be no hesitation in tearing down any narratives that are disproven by our scientific advances and reconstructing ones that better reflect reality." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/a-headless-god-or-religion-for-our)

> "This ain’t no fun as a single-player game; Metamodern Religion only comes to life with a collective of believers. Self-aware narrativity is also how we might hope that an increasing number of people will resonate with the stories we come up with: Any valid critique and additions that are useful while being coherent should be included without hesitation. As time progresses, the petrified dogmas of traditional religions will become ever more inconsistent. All the while, the population on average develops further and Metamodern Religion will exert an inexorable pull on adherents of traditional religions. At the same time, more scientific minded people would notice that the stories are in agreement with their worldview but provide much more personal and collective meaningfulness, so they too would be tempted to join in. Filling the God-shaped hole in our hearts in a way that doesn’t compromise on rationality is somewhat of a no-brainer.
>
> Metamodern religion will only feel intersubjectively real once a critical mass of “believers” subscribe to it. Just because we know that it’s just a story we made up doesn’t make it feel any less real. Even more so, we can believe it because we know we made it up. There is a certain bootstrapping principle at play here that reminds of Alexander Bard’s Syntheos, the created God, and the concept of Hyperstition. Like a collective placebo effect, we might be surprised how real our headless God will feel once enough of us have agreed on a version we could believe in." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/a-headless-god-or-religion-for-our)

> "The moral innovation draws people in. It gives a reason for the society to exist, a purpose that’s distinct from the outside world, a universalist complement to the particularist sense of national consciousness, an ideological mission that others will nod their heads at even if they don’t share. The reason we put such a high priority on a moral innovation is that missionary societies outcompete mercenary ones, not just in theory but in practice." - [The Network State, by Balaji Srinivasan](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states#:~:text=The%20moral%20innovation%20draws,theory%20but%20in%20practice.)

> "Supposing we have a collective purpose, what does collective action towards that purpose look like? This is why the process of building a network state includes a network union. From the very outset it organizes people to work together for the benefit of their chosen community through the familiar interface of their screens. This, again, is quite different from current “social” networks like Twitter, which give individual scores for likes and followers but no team dashboard, no way of setting and achieving tangible goals as a group." - [The Network State, by Balaji Srinivasan](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states#:~:text=supposing%20we%20have,as%20a%20group.)

> "I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world.. without you. A world without rules or controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you." - [Neo, The Matrix](https://www.finestquotes.com/movie_quotes/movie/Matrix/page/0.htm#:~:text=I%20know%20you%27re,leave%20to%20you.)

> "Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." - [Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/924-here-s-to-the-crazy-ones-the-misfits-the-rebels-the)
