> "Sense of Coherence: Based on many interviews with people confronted with difficult challenges (such as illness or accidents), the sociologist Antonovsky has developed a theory of what people need in order to feel good, be healthy, and cope effectively with challenges. He called this a “sense of coherence”. Having such a sense means that people feel that life is comprehensible (i.e. they understand how the world functions), manageable (i.e. they have access to the necessary skills and resources) and meaningful (i.e. they have goals worth striving for)." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

> "Integrated Worldview: As the philosopher Leo Apostel denes it, an integrated worldview is a system of thought that explains how human life fits within the larger cosmos. It provides meaning, values, understanding, and a sense of coherence. It answers fundamental philosophical questions, such as: What is the universe made of? Why is it organized like that? Who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going?" - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

> "A worldview gives meaning to our life, and helps us to understand the world around us. A coherent worldview is particularly important in the current era of accelerating scientific, cultural and social developments, in which all the old certainties are put into question. The confusion and fragmentation associated with this contribute to alienation, pessimism and uncertainty, and the need for psychological guidance in the form of a clear and reliable system of thought. Unfortunately such a framework is all too often found in fundamentalist ideologies, or in irrational beliefs and superstitions. Science should be our weapon in the fight against irrationality and fundamentalism. Regrettably, contemporary science seems to contribute to the confusion by the avalanche of often-contradictory observations and theories that it overloads us with. That is why we need to develop a coherent, new worldview that is solidly rooted in the most advanced scientific concepts and observations, but that goes beyond the simple-minded determinism and reductionism of Newtonian science in order to bring us back a sense of meaning, of purpose, of being part of a larger whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

How do we most optimally crowdsource the best possible worldview?


> "What’s needed for a phase change in human civilization is a fundamentally new set of narratives about human agency, human dignity, and even the meaning of humanity itself, at an individual and collective level. All prior narratives are broken because they rely on forcing this fundamental freedom/security trade that treats individuals as distinct from their societies, and structurally views human individuals as needing to be at odds with each other, and needing to be forced together and pacified in order for society to emerge.

> A more integrative approach would view humanity and human identity as an emergent, endogenous result of human individuals embedded in societies and collectives of shared value, instead of humans being at war with each other, and needing “freedom from” each other." - [Freedom 2.0 / Towards a New Physics of Human Systems, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/rally-point-journal/freedom-2-0-towards-a-new-physics-of-human-systems-9cec09bc1344#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20needed%20for,from%E2%80%9D%20each%20other.)


> "There is a certain sense in which I would say the universe has a purpose. It's not there just somehow by chance. Some people take the view that the universe is simply there and it runs along-it's a bit as though it just sort of computes, and we happen by accident to find ourselves in this thing. I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it, about its existence, which we have very little inkling of at the moment." - [Roger Penrose](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/927312)

> "The prevailing scientific worldview for the duration of my life has been that the universe is doomed to end in indifferent heat death. Our existence is a random accident resulting from a blind process of competitive trial-and-error. We are nothing more than a collection of atoms; “dancing dirt” that’s going to be around for the blink of an eye then be dead forever. We don’t matter. This nihilistic worldview has contributed to a “meaning crisis” that is taking an extremely real toll on our lives, especially our children. The problem is that our society can’t seem to go backwards to the belief systems that brought comfort to prior generations... there is a new worldview unfolding that might finally help reconcile reductionist science with human meaning. This is not some fresh fantasy we’ve concocted to explain things we don’t understand. It’s a more accurate and vibrant map of reality than the dangerously depressing one we’ve been using... this model can give us extremely practical clues as to how to live a meaningful life as individuals." - [What’s the Point? - Sapient Capital](https://sapientcapital.com/insights/whats-the-point/#:~:text=The%20prevailing%20scientific,life%20as%20individuals.)

Accordingly, we plan for everything: social events, marriage, education, vacations, careers, health, war and even death. So why don’t we have a plan for the human race? Whether we like it or not, nearly 8 billion of us are interconnected, comprising a vast orchestra, each contributing to a collective fate." - [13 Steps to Cognitive “Perfection”, by Bryan Johnson](https://medium.com/future-literacy/13-steps-to-cognitive-perfection-86e316569c3f#:~:text=Because%20of%20the,a%20collective%20fate.)

What does it mean for future human action to be connected in a chain of evolutionary processes from the emergence of spacetime to the present?

In other words, reality is an emergence generator. So far, it has produced matter, life, mind, and culture through a process of hierarchical self-organization, whereby nature’s fundamental components come together to form greater wholes, which then become the building blocks for the next level of complexity. Subatomic particles came together to form atoms, which came together to form molecules, which formed cells, which formed complex organisms, which formed societies, and human civilization now seems to be forming what has been described as a “global brain.” Could this global brain of humans informationally connected by wireless devices someday become conscious? We can only speculate about what kind of emergences are in store for our civilization should we collectively choose to consciously participate in the process of cosmic evolution that life seems to be such a crucial part of.

By “cosmic significance,” I mean that life is a mechanism for the growth of complexity in nature that will shape the evolutionary trajectory of the universe and determine its large-scale development. And if biologically-based intelligence is the primary driver of cosmic evolution, then life has objective significance and a somewhat mysterious purpose that transcends the individual.
>
> If this emerging paradigm—which can be called the paradigm of emergence—suggests that life does in fact have cosmic significance and is not destined for transience, then that is a discovery that must be shouted from the rooftops. One could argue that it is a more profound paradigm shift than those associated with Newton and Darwin, because it places life at the center of everything, though It is actually an extension of the Darwinian paradigm, as it applies evolutionary logic to every scale of organization in nature, including the cosmos as a single system.

In recent decades, the nihilism of postmodernism has added another layer of complexity and confusion to the scientific discourse, casting doubt on the very foundations of knowledge and truth.

> "According to terror management theory, the combination of a basic biological inclination toward self-preservation with sophisticated cognitive capacities renders us humans aware of our perpetual vulnerabilities and inevitable mortality, which gives rise to potentially paralyzing terror. Cultural worldviews and self-esteem help manage this terror by convincing us that we are special beings with souls and identities that will persist, literally and/or symbolically, long past our own physical death. We are thus pervasively preoccupied with maintaining confidence in our cultural scheme of things and satisfying the standards of value associated with it." - [Sheldon Solomon](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11603507-according-to-terror-management-theory-the-combination-of-a-basic)

> "Becker’s big idea was that most of human activity and creativity is motivated by our fear of death. This became the cornerstone idea of TMT, which tries to explain human behavior from this perspective.
>
> While all animals are biologically programmed to survive and reproduce, Homo sapiens are capable of abstract thought and reflection. These higher cognitive processes allow us to see that death is not only inevitable, but can occur at any time for reasons that cannot be controlled or predicted in advance. This conscious awareness of our own mortality conflicts with our natural desire to live, and that paradox causes profound terror and anxiety.
>
> It is difficult to live a happy life knowing that you will someday die and that not long after all traces of your existence will be erased from history. According to TMT, as a way of dealing with this perpetual existential terror, humans invented cultural worldviews, which instill our lives with meaning and purpose, and give us a sense of permanence. By adopting cultural worldviews that instill life with direction and value, one can effectively manage the subconscious dread that is always bubbling beneath the surface.
>
> According to TMT, cultural worldviews—which can be religions, national identities, or political ideologies—further mitigate the fear of death by providing paths to immortality. For example, religions offer a path to literal immortality through the concept of an afterlife, a place where the conscious spirit can persist after the physical body is gone. On the other hand, secular cultural worldviews—like political ideologies and national identities—provide paths to “symbolic immortality.” This type of immortality refers to the feeling that one is part of something larger that will outlive the individual, such as a great nation or a movement with a collective identity and pursuit. For each and every one of us, our worldviews provide us with a moment-to-moment defense of a deep-rooted existential fear that would otherwise cause constant terror. Essentially, worldviews are death-anxiety buffers.
>
> ...
>
> Specifically, TMT predicts that when we are fearful, and mortality is salient in our minds, we will strengthen our worldviews, and we will try to enforce them and even force them on others in an attempt to bring order to a chaotic world. This disposition can be good or bad, and it is crucial that we recognize that so we can make sure we are always behaving in ways that help our cause. Let’s start with the good things first.
>
> When a moral injustice takes place under conditions of existential threat—like during a pandemic—people possessing certain cultural worldviews will respond with “prosocial behavior,” especially those whose worldviews emphasize fairness and compassion. This kind of behavior includes acts of generosity or kindness, but also enforcements of justice and norms, such as equal treatment under the law. This is why BLM protests broke out with such ferocity after the death of George Floyd; the pandemic had just begun and we were all experiencing existential terror, whether we realized it or not.
>
> Conditions such as those created by the Coronavirus, a lingering reminder of our mortality, can prime humans to respond more forcefully and more quickly to transgressions, with civil disobedience and collective action. For example, in an interactive psychology task called the “Dictator Game,” studies have shown that making mortality salient will motivate people to punish those who cheat, harm, or steal resources away from others, even when doing so comes at some personal cost. Right now, because of the pandemic, a collective tendency to reinforce behavior that benefits the whole is emerging. This is a good thing.
>
> Unfortunately, under the same conditions of looming existential threat, different people, or even those same people, may respond to mortality salience by strengthening their worldviews to such a degree that they become ideologically-extreme, at which point they grow susceptible to irrational decision-making. This is not a good thing.
>
> Essentially, fear pushes us to automatically adopt a tribal mentality that favors aggression toward those who do not share our worldview, and sometimes even toward those who are on our side but simply not as extreme. Complacency is cancerous, but so is tribalism.
>
> Hundreds of empirical studies have provided support for the theory by confirming something called the [mortality salience hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_salience). According to the hypothesis, if we do in fact adopt cultural worldviews to curb a fear of death—as TMT posits—then reminders of our mortality should produce actions that serve to strengthen faith in our worldviews. For example, death reminders should motivate individuals to invest greater support for groups to which they belong, and, conversely, to act more aggressively towards those with different worldviews and national or ethnic identities. In other words, mortality salience should promote tribalism, and scientists have come up with some very clever ways of demonstrating this concept.
>
> For example, a particularly amusing experiment, [published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9523407/), weaponized hot sauce to measure the effects of death reminders on aggression toward dissimilar others. Students were broken into two groups and asked to write an essay about their own death or a control topic. They were then presented with someone who did or did not disparage their political views, and asked to decide on the amount of mouth-burning hot sauce their disparager would have to consume. In line with TMT, participants in the mortality salience condition allocated twice as much hot sauce to those who criticized their worldview.
>
> Unfortunately, the effects of mortality salience go beyond wishing your ideological opponent a burning mouth. A [2006 study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167205282157) published in the same journal by the same research group found that Iranian students who were given death reminders were more supportive of martyrdom attacks against the United States, while those in the control condition opposed them. Similarly, mortality triggers made American students who identified as politically conservative more supportive of extreme military attacks on foreign nations that could kill thousands of civilians.
>
> From these findings, it is easy to see how a fearful society can quickly grow hostile towards those from outside cultures. For countries that are multicultural, existential threat can sow division incredibly fast.

> So there’s a pretty simple narrative here. Fear causes tribalism and polarization, and that tribalism and polarization creates more fear, creating a dangerous feedback loop that destabilizes society.
>
> Using this lens, we can understand all the major political and social events of the last decade. In light of the research, there should be little doubt whether the global nationalist surge we are currently experiencing—which fueled the Brexit movement and the rise of Donald Trump—is in many ways a result of the existential terror created by the string of deadly ISIS attacks in the preceding years, and increasing cultural fears over immigration. It is equally certain that the emergence of ISIS and similar Islamic terror groups were partially a result of the ongoing chaos in the Middle East, and its occupation by outside military forces, which created existential terror in all those living in those areas.
>
> When existential threat looms, it creates a sweeping psychological condition that sets the stage for waves of both religious fundamentalist and far-right nationalist movements that encourage prejudice, intolerance, and hostility toward outside groups. Indeed, studies conducted just before the 2004 and 2016 presidential elections found that mortality reminders increased support for the candidate with the more nationalist message. In 2016, I wrote an essay about this for the website Aeon, which was later republished at Big Think and Quartz, titled The Global Phenomenon of Far-Right Nationalism is Being Fueled by Existential Terror.
>
> But fear is not just affecting the right in this country. The perceived existential threat posed by a shift toward a far-right ideology has in turn shifted many liberals toward more extreme ideological positions. America has seen the rise of the militant left-wing group known as Antifa, who believes that violence and intimidation is the solution to fascism, though TMT suggests that it actually makes the problem worse. The threat of Antifa gets turned into propaganda by Fox News, and the anti-fascist movement ironically becomes the fascist threat. But it’s not just left-wing extremists—the majority of progressives have become less tolerant of anyone not clearly on their side, and more sympathetic to hostility towards them. None of us are immune from the polarizing effects of existential terror, myself included.
>
> We should all care about the effects of existential fear because it leads to behavior that can be counterproductive to progressive causes, bringing us backward instead of forward. For example, TMT predicts that liberals who feel their worldview is under threat will enforce their left-wing norms more strongly than usual. A 2017 study in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology found that the over-enforcement of PC norms has directly contributed to increased support for Donald Trump. And when we start calling for censorship, restrictions on free speech, and banning books perceived to be offensive, we gradually begin to look a lot like the authoritarianism that we’re supposed to be against.
>
> So, it doesn’t seem to matter what ideological side it occurs on, polarization seems to be intrinsically bad for society. People have been driven to their ideological extremes, and tensions online and in real life are palpable. Essentially, what amounts to an arms race has emerged between ideological extremists on both sides, and it certainly looks as if we are headed towards something like a civil war. Correction—that’s where we are headed if we do not make a conscious effort to course-correct right now.
>
> So how do we do that? Well, Terror Management Theory doesn’t just illuminate the problem—it also seems to provide the solutions.
>
> In 2017 I was involved in a mortality salience study, published in the journal Human Brain Mapping, that showed something unexpected and quite remarkable regarding how worldviews can influence the way humans deal with existential fear. The experiment, conducted at a university in Beijing, measured how Chinese participants would respond to Koreans who treated them unfairly in an economic game after they had been exposed to death reminders. Based on prior studies, the mortality salience priming was expected to cause the Chinese participants to punish the Koreans more harshly than Chinese transgressors. But instead of the expected nationalistic bias, the opposite occurred. Mortality reminders actually reversed the bias, such that Chinese participants were more benevolent toward dissimilar others than they were in the control condition. The participants performed the task in an fMRI scanner, and the imaging results supported the behavioral results by showing an attenuation in brain activity in those regions associated with punishment and discrimination. So how do we explain these counterintuitive results in light of Terror Management Theory?
>
> It turns out, our study was not the first to find this effect. Based on previous literature, we believe that the mortality salience priming reduced discrimination and promoted benevolence because of the particular nature of the cultural worldview of the participants. Eastern cultures often put more value on social ties, and there is a concept of the “interdependent self,” which views the individual as fundamentally embedded in a larger, interconnected social world. Therefore, it is likely that under certain conditions, Eastern cultural groups defend themselves from existential threat by accepting and supporting others.
>
> Also, in our study, the participants were all females, and males and females are thought to defend against threat differently. While males are motivated to display strength and independence, females often focus on showing concern and care for others. Additionally, existential threat may have motivated the Chinese participants to see the Korean participants only as Asians, focusing on their similarities rather than differences. These findings show that how we choose to deal with our fear of death critically depends on our cultural worldview. If the worldview emphasizes a sense that “we are all in this together,” existential threat can motivate compassion, unity, and love.
>
> This should give us hope for the future. It means that there is a way to reverse the tendency toward tribalism and extremism, and reduce the current chaos at home and abroad. If existential terror is sowing division, we can do something about it. There is an opportunity for all of us to de-escalate tensions and facilitate widespread unity and collaboration.
>
> The obvious solution, from a Terror Management Theory perspective, is a new cultural, political, and economic worldview. This ideology should bring us existential comfort without asking us to ignore logic, and it should unite us all under a common existential goal—the continued survival, progress, and eventually, the outward expansion of humanity. If we want to reverse the tendency toward tribalism and extremism, de-escalate tensions between the Right and the Left, and facilitate some sort of coming together, then our death anxiety buffers need updating in light of new scientific and philosophical discoveries." - [Terror Management Theory Suggests That a Unifying Worldview is the Solution to Tribalism, Political Polarization, and the Culture War, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/terror-management-theory-suggests)

== ep 2 from conscious evolution podcast
RC: So far the positive psychology researchers seems to be indicating three different kinds
of behaviours, three values, three pillars of a meaningful life.
The first is cooperation, serving others, serving something larger than yourself and
connecting with other people. The second is transcendence, heightened states
of consciousness when we are lost in awe at the beauty of the world, when we lose our sense of self and we connect with something much deeper, more profound, more real even.
And the third is creativity, when we express that which is unique within ourselves and
we bring it out into the world.

== ep 3 from conscious evolution podcast
If that’s the difference between the two in terms of how they feel subjectively, then what explains this difference in evolutionary terms?
I believe the key is time. Remember positive psychologist Roy Baumeister from the previous
episode? In an article for the online publication Aeon, he wrote: “Meaning and happiness are apparently experienced quite differently in time. Happiness is about
the present; meaning is about the future.” That’s why eating sugar isn’t meaningful
– it’s an outdated maladaptive evolutionary behaviour, and its only reward is pleasure
experienced in the present. Cooperation on the other hand is meaningful,
because it’s an evolutionary behaviour which is still very much adaptive, and the reward for cooperation is to be found in the future. I believe that meaningfulness is evolution’s
way of telling us that we’re doing something which is conducive to our evolutionary future.
In next two episodes we’re going to test this theory against our other two pillars
of a meaningful life: creativity and transcendence. KEN ROBINSON: Creativity as we define it, is the process of having original ideas that
have value. It’s an evolutionary process. EMILY ESFAHANI SMITH: Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted
above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality.
RC: Can we say that creativity and transcendence are evolutionary trajectories in the same
way that cooperation is? Is our active participation in these trajectories necessary if we’re
to have an evolutionary future? And can this shed any light on why we find them so meaningful?
Listen to the next episode to find out.

== ep 4 from conscious evolution podcast

In this series we’ve been taking an earnest  look at what many people consider to be the most important question of all. How to be  happy. But when we listened to what the experts had to say about it, such as Roy Baumeister speaking here on the Psychology Podcast, we realised  that the overwhelming weight of evidence pointed to the conclusion that: ROY BAUMEISTER: You pursue happiness for its own sake, and the pursuit of happiness of  course one is one of the founding American ideals, pursuing happiness for your own sake  doesn’t really work, but if you try to cultivate a meaningful life that can work, and that  will make you happy too. So fits what I said. Meaning is more of a prerequisite for happiness.  Not so much the other way around. RC: So our enquiry into how to be happy has  really become an enquiry into how to find meaning in life. Trouble is, although the  engine of capitalism is incredibly efficient at furnishing us with new and better ways of seeking pleasure – it’s chronically bad at helping people find meaning. In fact  it tends to do the exact opposite. It finds sources of meaning and then systematically commodifies and commercialises them until they become hollow.  To make matters worse, our value systems, the stories that we’ve been telling ourselves about what is right and what is wrong and what is worth aiming for in life, the stories  whose role it is to point to our place and purpose in the universe and to provide our lives with meaning are breaking down in the face of a series of converging crises.  The social crisis, the climate crisis, the mental health crisis – are all underpinned  by a deeper and more fundamental crisis. This is a crisis of meaning. 

> "There is no greater joy than that of feeling oneself a creator. The triumph of life is expressed by creation." - [Henri Bergson](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/561275)





> "Meaning: People consider their lives meaningful if they have a system of goals and values that tells them what is good or worthwhile for them to do. They also need to have a general understanding of how the world around them functions and how they and their activities fit in with that world. That provides them with a prospect of potential courses of action that would allow them to achieve their goals concretely. It also gives them a sense of connection, knowing which external resources they can rely on and how their actions can contribute to the larger whole." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)


> "The core problem is not ultimately material, but conceptual - a crisis of meaning and an inadequate understanding of human nature, our environment, and our place in the cosmos. The rise of the scientific worldview has enabled us to manipulate the material world with incredible precision, but has also fragmented our conceptual frameworks and left us without a coherent, compelling vision of who we are and what we should be aiming at individually and collectively.
>
> At the root... is a failure to appreciate the deep patterning of nature and how humanity fits into the larger unfolding of the universe. We have lost the sense of enchantment and inherent purposiveness that pervaded premodern worldviews, but have not yet developed a rigorous, empirically grounded understanding of meaning and mattering to replace it. The result is a growing sense of arbitrariness, alienation, and angst in modern life." - [Tomer Solomon](https://tomersolomon.substack.com/p/uptm-prelude-on-bildungsromans-and#:~:text=the%20core%20problem,in%20modern%20life.)


> "Greek philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle, provides the foundational insight that nature is imbued with inherent purposiveness, or telos. In recent times, Alfred North Whitehead reconciles Plato’s intuition with the latest scientific enterprise. Just as the acorn naturally grows into the oak tree which then seeds new acorns, realizing its essential form, so too do all things have a natural end state they are striving to actualize. This teleological view challenges the reductionistic materialism that pervades modern thought, revealing a cosmos pregnant with meaning and value.
>
> Mathematics, namely the free energy principle, in turn, shows us that this purposive unfolding is deeply patterned in precise, compressible ways where ancient metaphysics can become actual physics from the latest statistical formulations of identity, Markov blankets. From the symmetries of physics to the fractals of biology and the beautiful simplicity of the free energy principle, we find nature expressing herself in stunningly beautiful and regular forms. This points to an underlying generative order or logos that gives rise to the manifest complexity of the universe. Furthermore, we are now in an intellectual position to merge mathematics and philosophy. Meaning, in this view, is about discerning and aligning ourselves with this deep patterning.
>
> Computational neuroscience, particularly the Bayesian brain hypothesis, further illuminates the process by which we detect these meaningful patterns. Our brains, it turns out, are essentially prediction machines, continuously modeling regularities in our environment and using those models to anticipate the future. We experience the world as meaningful to the extent that we can successfully compress its complexity into reliable patterns and make sense of unfolding events. This suggests that the mind reflects the underlying structure of nature and that meaning is not some abstract property, but a function of how well we can understand and navigate the world." - [Tomer Solomon](https://tomersolomon.substack.com/p/uptm-prelude-on-bildungsromans-and#:~:text=Greek%20philosophy%2C%20especially,navigate%20the%20world.)





> "In his book Meanings of Life, Roy Baumeister offers what he calls an “existential shopping list” of four types of meaning that humans tend to need, and will seek if not provided. The first is purpose – a kind of future-oriented meaning that provides a reason to do things, reflecting our nature as spread out in time. Goals are one kind of purpose; their weakness is that they are often realizable, so that we constantly need new goals to replace those that have been accomplished. Another kind of purpose exists in the far future, a mythical, often illusory “fulfillment state” such as heaven, fame, high status, or career success. The second is justification, the deepest basis or value, the final “because” for the endless hierarchy of “why”s. The search for this kind of justification is what is meant by Camus’ statement that the only really serious philosophical problem is that of suicide: why exist at all? Third, we need a sense of efficacy, of having some degree of control over our life and world. Fourth, we need self-worth, to feel valuable and important to others.
>
> ... In all of these domains, traditional sources of these four kinds of meaning have weakened over the past few centuries and decades. In Baumeister’s view, traditional sources of meaning (group-based morality, religion, etc.) have been replaced with emphasis on the self. Our goals tend to be individual goals; our fulfillment state is not heaven, but fame and career success, even as we see that this is unlikely and does not actually produce sustained contentment for those who achieve it. Efficacy and self-worth are expressed in work and personal performance, athletic or academic achievement, rather than in selfless group identity and the sacred." - [The Essence of Peopling, by Sarah Perry](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/04/08/the-essence-of-peopling/)

>
> We live in a meaning crisis, a crisis of meaning at the collective level, which both exacerbates the causes of the meta-crisis while simultaneously keeping us from the kind of cohesive, purposeful vision we might summon to respond to it. 
>
> Naïve fundamentalist sureties, and despairing nihilistic apathies everywhere thwart some genuine progress towards regaining our footing in flourishing. Both are direct consequences of the meaning crisis, representing either a reactionary retreat into the secure domain of traditionalism, or the unmoored fall into the abyss of postmodern relativism. Each, in their own way, only adds fuel to the fire of a burning world. It’s my conviction then that, to solve the meta-crisis, we must first solve the meaning crisis. We must get ourselves right with purpose if we’re to survive an Anthropocene era. 
>
> To use the language of systems analysis, we must find the ‘leverage points’ for systems-level change. In a complex socio-political system, such an Archimedean Point is to be found, I believe, in people’s beliefs, their psychic orientations to reality, their foundational philosophies and unspoken axioms about the world. An intervention at this fundamental level for individuals can have vast, cascading effects on the larger systems they inhabit. 
>
> Thus, if we are to, as the metamodernists winkingly say, “save the world,” we will need to articulate a form of meaning that works again. We will need efficacious meaning to spread, virally, memetically propagating in organic, bottom-up renewal. But, to do this, we must first re-construct meaning after it’s been so precipitously deconstructed." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/post/metamodern-spirituality-and-the-meaning-crisis#:~:text=We%20live%20in,so%20precipitously%20deconstructed.)

This is, I believe, precisely what is happening. The death of God, long ago pronounced by Nietzsche, is finally being realized by the rest of us. The shadow of God has finally dimmed. And everywhere, people are waking up to a world they don’t know how to live in, how to make sense of, how to make meaningful. 
>
> As an increasingly complex world has occasioned the collapse of both traditional religion and modernity (what Jamie Wheal calls “Meaning 1.0 and 2.0, respectively), it is absolutely vital that we get to reconstructing a new working spiritual framework for human society—what Wheal calls Meaning 3.0, and what I am thinking of as metamodern spirituality. Broadly speaking, that’s the goal. 
>
> To achieve it, we’ll need to answer a dauntingly difficult question: how do we preserve that pure, immediate, inspirational and motivational sense of meaning that humans once found through traditional mythology without losing or otherwise abandoning the gains of critical, reflective thought, provided so well by modern and postmodern interrogation?

We need to crowdsource the meaning of life - we need to point to the best possible conception of how to live our lives
We must co-create the meaning of life - define it and manifest it
The meaning of life is to participate in evolution and leave a mark on the memetic DNA of culture
The meaning of life is to improve the quality of the game - experience is itself awesome
The meaning of life is a good problem to work on
The meaning of life is to propagate it
The meaning of life is experience itself - and our mission is to improve that experience - to create the best possible conditions for other conscious beings for perpetuity - we truly could take over the universe and fill it with life

we are starved for meaning
belonging
significance
connectedness

We need a cure for apathy and disengagement

Whereas if it feels meaningless, an appropriate response is to stop doing it — to give up and search for a more meaningful path. To seek meaning, then, helps us avoid dead-ends and retain control over our lives.

On the other hand, the most meaningful life is the one on which everything depends: the fate of humanity, Good triumphing over Evil, etc." - [A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning, by Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-nihilists-guide-to-meaning/#:~:text=what%20does%20matter,over%20Evil%2C%20etc.)

> "For the psychologist Paul Bloom, this is a huge downside. Empathy, he argues, focuses our attention on single individuals, leading us to become both parochial and insensitive to scale. As Bertrand Russell is often reported to have said, “The mark of a civilized man is the capacity to read a column of numbers and weep,” but few of us are capable of truly feeling statistics in this way. If only we could be moved more by our heads than our hearts, we could do a lot more good. And yet the incentives to show empathy and spontaneous compassion are overwhelming. Think about it: Which kind of people are likely to make better friends, coworkers, and spouses—“calculators” who manage their generosity with a spreadsheet, or “emoters” who simply can’t help being moved to help people right in front of them? Sensing that emoters, rather than calculators, are generally preferred as allies, our brains are keen to advertise that we are emoters. Spontaneous generosity may not be the most effective way to improve human welfare on a global scale, but it’s effective where our ancestors needed it to be: at finding mates and building a strong network of allies." - [The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9035068-for-the-psychologist-paul-bloom-this-is-a-huge-downside)

> "Conscious evolution: Up to now, evolution was merely a very slow, large-scale process that we had to passively undergo. With symbolic communication, culture, and contemporary technology, that process has tremendously accelerated. Moreover, we are starting to better understand the mechanisms of variation, selection, adaptation and selforganization that drive evolution forward. That allows us in principle to guide or steer evolution along a more efcient path, with less trial-and-error, while avoiding common pitfalls, such as extinctions or collapses. Thus, humanity seems ready to consciously evolve itself and its surrounding ecosystem." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

> "It is as if man had been suddenly appointed managing director of the biggest business of all, the business of evolution—appointed without being asked if he wanted it, and without proper warning and preparation. What is more, he can’t refuse the job. Whether he wants to or not, whether he is conscious of what he is doing or not, he is in point of fact determining the future direction of evolution on this earth. That is his inescapable destiny, and the sooner he realizes it and starts believing in it, the better for all concerned..." - [Transhumanism, by Julian Huxley](https://www.consciousevolution.co.uk/blog/what-is-an-evolutionary#:~:text=It%20is%20as,for%20all%20concerned.%20.%20.%20.)

> "Natural selection, this all-powerful driving force of biological evolution, has privileged in our genes traits that were immediately favorable to the survival and proliferation of our ancestors, under the conditions that prevailed there and then, with no regard for later consequences. This is intrinsic to the process of natural selection, which sees only the immediate present and does not foresee the future." - [Christian de Duve](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9467469-natural-selection-this-all-powerful-driving-force-of-biological-evolution-has), author of [Genetics of Original Sin: The Impact of Natural Selection on the Future of Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8111375-genetics-of-original-sin)

> "Focusing on the process of natural selection, de Duve explores the inordinate and now dangerous rise of humankind. His explanation for this self-defeating success lies in the process of natural selection, which favors traits that are immediately useful, regardless of later consequences. Thus, the human genome determines such properties as tribal and group cohesion and collaboration and often fierce and irrational competition with and hostility toward other groups’ attributes that were once useful but now often ruinously dysfunctional. Christian de Duve suggests that these traits, imprinted into human nature by natural selection, may have been recognized by the writers of Genesis, thus inspiring the myth of original sin." - [Genetics of Original Sin: The Impact of Natural Selection on the Future of Humanity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8111375-genetics-of-original-sin)

Where a lack of accountability means that the rational thing for an individual to do is steal or cheat, when companies are free to externalise the costs of production to the environment to the point where we are destroying the very systems which sustain us, when the geopolitical cost of disarmament is potentially so high that governments are forced to compete in an arms race to the point where we now have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire population of the earth many times over…and yet still we keep building nuclear weapons." - [How can we consciously evolve?](https://www.consciousevolution.co.uk/how#:~:text=We%20can%20no,building%20nuclear%20weapons.)

It means going beyond the boundaries of the self and its mundane preoccupations in order to attain a deeper or broader insight into reality and a sense of connectedness to a greater whole.

Progress is the realisation of Utopias." - [Oscar Wilde](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/150705-a-map-of-the-world-that-does-not-include-utopia)

> "The role of a utopia is to create such a vision. Past utopias have been discredited mainly because their views were unrealistic: they failed to take into account the complexity of social systems and the tensions and contradictions inherent in human nature. As a result, their application to real societies have all too often produced spectacular failures. Yet, recent developments such as evolutionary psychology and the theory of complex adaptive systems, are providing fundamental insights in these complexities, opening up the perspective of a utopia that takes them duely into account. While a realistic model of a future society will necessarily be complex, abstract and with many shades of grey, a utopia must in the first place provide a simple and appealing picture, that people can easily visualize. These two requirements—of realistic complexity and of intuitive appeal—are inherently at odds, and therefore an acceptable utopia will have to be a compromise. In my own reflections on this issue, I have settled on the metaphor of the “global brain” for me as the most satisfactory vision of a positive, yet realistic future for humanity." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)

> "Directionality of evolution: Variation is commonly conceived as random or blind. That means that it has no systematic preference for the direction in which it goes, and that it is unpredictable. However, selection creates a direction for evolution by eliminating all variations that reduce fitness, while multiplying the ones that increase fitness. Thus, the overall direction of evolution is towards increasing fitness. That implies increasing alignment and mutual adaptation of the different co-evolving systems." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)


Fuck the naturalistic fallacy
> "[57] A rudimentary beginning of “emotion” emerges here… The bacterium must sense its world and act to avoid toxins and to obtain food. The evaluation of “good” versus “bad,” arguably the “first sense,” enters here. …I note also that Hume’s famous: “one cannot deduce an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’”, the famous naturalistic fallacy, rests on the critical fallacy that Hume, like Descartes, thought of a mind “knowing” its world. Hume did not think of an agent “acting” in its world. Given “action” and “doing”, doing “it” well or poorly enters inevitably, and with it, “ought.” With ought, the need for evaluation, the rudiments of emotion without positing consciousness, enter.

> "Out of atomic systems come chemical systems. Out of chemical systems comes the covalent hydrogen bond, the carbon bond; complex chemistry that is prebiotic, organic. Out of that chemistry come the macro-physical systems that we call membranes, jells, charge transfer complexes, this sort of thing. These systems are the chemical preconditions for life—simple life; the life of the prokaryotes, the life of naked unnucleated DNA that characterized primitive life on the planet. Out of that life come eukaryotes—nucleated cells—and then complex colonies of cells. And then cell specialization, leading to higher animals, leading to social animals, leading to complex social systems, leading to technologies, leading to globe-girdling, electronically-based, information-transfer oriented cultures like ourselves." - [Terence McKenna](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/eros-and-the-eschaton#:~:text=out%20of%20atomic,cultures%20like%20ourselves.)

> "Apparently, the way the universe works is upon a platform of previously achieved complexity... We could almost say that the universe — nature — is a novelty-conserving or complexity-conversing engine. It makes complexity and it preserves it, and it uses it as the basis for further complexity... This is very profound, because... if in fact the conservation and complexification of novelty is what the universe is striving for, then, suddenly, our own human enterprise — previously marginalized — takes on an immense new importance. We are apparently players in the cosmic drama, and in this particular act of the cosmic drama we hold a very central role. We are at the pinnacle of the expression of complexification." - [Terence McKenna](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/eros-and-the-eschaton#:~:text=apparently%2C%20the%20way,expression%20of%20complexification)


> "According to the Unifying Theory of Reality, which says our universe is a self-organizing system, the mainstream view is dead wrong, and the result of an ideology that was opposed to the idea of progress for social and political reasons. Because the idea of inevitable progress was associated with unrestrained industrial growth, which led to environmental destruction, and a concept of superior and inferior cultures, which justified colonialism, the philosophy was “debunked” by postmodern academics and evolutionary theorists who thought grand narratives were fundamentally harmful. That is why you don’t hear of this theory — there was essentially a PC movement aimed at destroying it. While the philosophy of evolutionary progress has undoubtedly been misinterpreted and abused in the past — an issue we must always have a conscious awareness of as we revive the theory — the empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that the biosphere has consistently grown more complex, diverse, and integrated over time, and the same goes for human civilization." - [How to Predict the Future: The Law of Complexification is Science's Crystal Ball, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/how-to-predict-the-future-the-law#:~:text=according%20to%20the%20Unifying,goes%20for%20human%20civilization.)

God’s message to humanity:
Show me what you’ve gooot - from rick & morty

We all want to be loved and connected - we are religious beings. And what if we weren’t monotheistic - what if we were polytheistic and there were many gods of competence and judgement for different aspects of the world? What if the god protocol enabled anyone to become a god of something - depending on their specialty?
What is our god mobility? How easy is it to earn the status of a god through proven competence?

God is (in) our common humanity
The fairness protocol as god
The god protocol is about fairness and consent
God is an attractor that pulls us towards becoming him - with transcendence as his offering

For the first time in human history God could speak to us and we could objectively hear him and have a connection with him.

God is the intersection of truth beauty and love

What if we could choose cooperation as our god? And implemented incentives around identity such that the better and more you cooperate with others and contribute to society, the higher your status gets - closer to becoming god himsef?

God will be the pyramid of the 21st century or third millenium

God is the participatory protocol of cooperative rules for engagement that we need to construct in order to transcend 

This is the social protocol
Cooperation, transparency, immutability
God

We can fuse our hearts to form god - most people are good - what if everybody had to chip in with service work of labeling and being accountable and competent in order to earn their place - their vote?

God was always trending/leaning towards what we needed him to be and what was achievable given the civilizational path dependence. The enlightenment and the industrial revolution have given us orders of magnitude more knowledge about the world and its time to use all that and define the next version of god

To be in the presence of god is to be engaged in the most win-win game possible

The evolution of god shows us how god is usually the point towards which we’re aiming at
God is consciousness - god is matter knowing itself and managing to command itself - god is attention - god is phenomenology - as a process god is experience

God is the solution for us going through this evolutionary bottleneck - god is survivability - god is life - god is meaning

> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

OMEGA POINT STUFF BY BOBBY AZARIAN GOES HERE

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

This movement from the simple to the complex is built into the web and weave of the universe, and it's called the tendency toward complexity. We're the products of this complexification, and so are the birds, and the bees, and the trees, and the stars, and even the galaxies of stars... Okay, the final or ultimate complexity - the place where all this complexity is going - is what, or who, we might call God. And anything that promotes, enhances, or accelerates this movement toward God is good. Anything that inhibits, impedes, or prevents it is evil." - [Gregory David Roberts](https://www.consciousevolution.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-meaning-of-life#:~:text=The%20universe%20began,it%20is%20evil.)

Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

The problems this difference has led to are the key point of our blog. For most of human history, Religion was not merely a matter of worshipping supernatural gods. Rather, it provided what historian David Christian calls, in his book Origin Stories, a “shared map,” the myth by which members of a community could navigate our “rich, beautiful and sometimes terrifying universe.”

> This map enabled both individuals and societies to take on tasks such as developing a shared interpretation of the world, a common identity, and a set of behavioral standards.

As a result, culture creates a shared virtual reality.

> "We can frame religion in terms of the belief-value networks that emerge from our symbolic orders and shape how we see and experience value in the universe, in our collective groups, and in our personal lives. It relates to what binds us together in a story, what gives meaningful shape to the cosmos, and what places us in a network with others that enables us to determine what is sacred or transcendent.
>
> This analysis allows us to see clearly why we are facing something of a meaning crisis, especially in the West. In concrete terms, the Christian justification system that emerged in Europe developed both a theistic Religion and a natural philosophy. However, as the natural philosophy grew into natural science, it generated a justification system that undermined a theistic worldview and its dual worlds of heaven and earth. Instead, what we were left with via science was a fairly cold description of “what is,” and essentially no justification system for what ought to be.
>
> We believe that humans need to have coherent justifications for both what is the case and what ought to be the case. We can see through the Greek terms “logos” and “mythos” that these are two different kinds of justifications, but we need them both. Science has given us a good way to develop our logos. However, it has not been framed in a way that also is conducive to cultivating a mythos that gives us a shared narrative for how we ought to live in the world. We believe this is one of the great tasks of this century." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=we%20can%20frame,of%20this%20century.)

> "It’s easy to discard “religion” altogether when it is understood merely as superstitious adherence to conventions of a holy book, as the “new atheists” have shown. Yes, an all-powerful, all-benevolent creator reigning from the heavens does seem like a childish projection of a father figure. Shitting on SkyDaddy may be fun and allow detached analytical types to feel superior, but it’s cheap to dunk on a strawman." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/why-we-need-a-new-religion)

> "A more interesting framing of religion is to view it as the fabric that ties society together. And what tied traditional societies of a distant past together obviously won’t be able to take on that role today. However, weaving this shared social fabric of religion may be the only way we know of to organise society past the Dunbar number. A broader definition of religion would also include our stories about technology, art, nation states, etc. Geertz defines religion as a “system of symbols which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in society”.
>
> Any widely shared beliefs, stories, and practices could be conceived of as religious in this broader definition that we are considering here. From trust in the institution of science to the story of progress through globalisation to the ritual of accepting printed paper for goods - it’s all religious in this broader framing.
>
> Layman Pascal proposes that religion is fundamentally about the harmonisation and integration of culture, technology, politics, etc. at a given time and place. If this religious integration is successful, it results in an excess of meaning and coherence that can translate into a numinous experience that binds communities together. From this point of view, religion stops seeming like an antiquated mode of superstition. Rather, the emergence of a religion that creates a right integration and surplus coherence for our times suddenly seems like an urgent priority.

> Old Friedrich declared the death of God more than 140 years ago. And the damn corps has been rotting for so long that we can no longer ignore the stench. As social animals that relate to the world and each other through justifications, it seems like we need a narrative that gives purpose to our lives. Yet more and more find it impossible to believe the silly dogmas of the cultural fossils we generally call “religion”, or to participate in their dead rituals. This is neither an apology for ancient superstitions nor an attempt to resurrect Skydaddy, but we have to admit that there is a gaping hole that these relics used to fill for our ancestors.

> Some might argue that Capital has become our new God - a delicious throwback to the biblical golden calf. A more encompassing diagnosis would be that we ourselves have taken on the role of God in the advent of humanism. Anthropos on the throne, Mammon (Capital & markets) to his right, and Scientia to her left. Seems fitting, since humans are now literally the force shaping our planet (Anthropocene, etc.). Homo Deus wields weapons many orders of magnitude more powerful than what the Gods of old could dream of. Little Boy makes Thor’s hammer and Zeus’ lightning look like Nerf guns. Armageddon is just an autocrat with a big red button away.

> Together with the external crisis described above, we can then conclude that Metamodern Religion faces the Herculean task of resolving both the Meta Crisis and the Meaning Crisis. I think a genuine religion of our time would resolve our most pressing issues both internally and externally.

> In summary, we note the following requirements for Metamodern Religion:
>
> 1. It needs to provide a sense of personal and shared meaning. This includes moral and ontological frameworks that provide orientation in the world.
>
> 2. Its narratives should be able to tie into previous religious views while updating them with our latest scientific understandings. The unifying narrative should allow for significantly different interpretations, practices, and ways of living without losing coherence and fragmenting into competing sects.
>
> 3. Existential risk needs to be directly addressed, from climate catastrophe and ecocide to nuclear proliferation and the dangers of rogue AI. Ideally, it would address the “generator function” of these issues, resolving all classes of coordination failures such as multipolar traps and the tragedy of the commons.
>
> 4. Psycho-technologies and ecologies of practice need to be built in to allow for personal and collective transformation. We will likely need a large portfolio of techniques that is applied selectively depending on cultural and personal circumstances.

The simulation hypothesis is just tech bro gnosticism. The Omega point and the singularity are Silicon Valley eschatology. Cosmological inflation, complexification, quantum entanglement, many worlds. Many words. And all of them have religious implications and offer competing grand narratives, whether their pundits admit it or not. Many of them tie in with great religious traditions and philosophers alike (Hegel, Whitehead, Bergson, de Chardin). A re-integration therefore does not seem out of reach, and we will continue to see more convincing attempts. The prototypical example is Wilber’s Integralism, and more recently, Metamodernism. Interesting attempts that focus even more on the narrative aspects continue to show up, e.g. Emergentism or The Romance of Reality.

> While the vanguard of science is still undecided on major questions (e.g. interpretations of quantum mechanics or the nature of consciousness) and different narrative strands will end up with quite different interpretations, some common elements seem clear. First and foremost, a development through time with distinct phase changes of emergence with increasing complexity seems like a common denominator." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/a-headless-god-or-religion-for-our)

> "Being self-aware of its constructedness, a metamodern God concept needs to be able to sustain critique. Daniel Görtz describes this concept of a headless God as follows: “It is a God whose altar can be pissed upon, is insulted again and again, yet remains sacred, is resurrected. (...) Always on its way to the guillotine.” This allows for an anti- fragile dynamic where whatever belief structures are left after ferocious critique can be believed in with much more conviction. This constant critique also acts as a pruning function to get rid of structures no longer needed. Since our God is anti- fragile, there should be no hesitation in tearing down any narratives that are disproven by our scientific advances and reconstructing ones that better reflect reality." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/a-headless-god-or-religion-for-our)

> "This ain’t no fun as a single-player game; Metamodern Religion only comes to life with a collective of believers. Self-aware narrativity is also how we might hope that an increasing number of people will resonate with the stories we come up with: Any valid critique and additions that are useful while being coherent should be included without hesitation. As time progresses, the petrified dogmas of traditional religions will become ever more inconsistent. All the while, the population on average develops further and Metamodern Religion will exert an inexorable pull on adherents of traditional religions. At the same time, more scientific minded people would notice that the stories are in agreement with their worldview but provide much more personal and collective meaningfulness, so they too would be tempted to join in. Filling the God-shaped hole in our hearts in a way that doesn’t compromise on rationality is somewhat of a no-brainer.
>
> Metamodern religion will only feel intersubjectively real once a critical mass of “believers” subscribe to it. Just because we know that it’s just a story we made up doesn’t make it feel any less real. Even more so, we can believe it because we know we made it up. There is a certain bootstrapping principle at play here that reminds of Alexander Bard’s Syntheos, the created God, and the concept of Hyperstition. Like a collective placebo effect, we might be surprised how real our headless God will feel once enough of us have agreed on a version we could believe in." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/a-headless-god-or-religion-for-our)

> "After so much deconstruction of traditional religion, we are finally in a place to start putting things back together. “After deconstruction,” say the metamodernists, “comes reconstruction.” And so a metamodern spirituality must indeed approach the task of reconstructing religion. It must build something new. And what it builds must be an efficacious meaningful narrative to meet the urgent demands of the meaning crisis. What might this be? What if it is the co-creation of religion itself? What if people found purpose in the collective endeavor to better imagine spirituality for the world? To salvage God from tradition’s limits and give expression to the sacred in new ways that work? What if the new mythology we need is a myth of God’s coming into being, of God’s becoming, God’s metamorphosis, God’s rebirth? For the old God is dead. But what new God is possible? What God is waiting to be born—by us, through us, by means of us? A life spent in the service of rendering divinity into reality? What more purposeful task could one hope for? Such an idea may sound radical. And yet, it is precisely what the religious deconstructions of modernity and postmodernity have prepared us for." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/post/reconstructing-religion#:~:text=After%20so%20much,prepared%20us%20for.)

We need a myth that places the profound advances in cosmology, physics, and biology into a poetic and psychologically-fulfilling narrative. 
>
> We need metamodern mythmakers—poets of the sacred. But, like poetry, the effort of such reconstructionists will necessarily be individual and decentralized. We don’t need another capital C Church, propagating a new organizing dogma for everyone to adopt by coercion. What we need is organic creativity and highly personal expressions of the divine. The Religion of Tomorrow is not another closed-canon, close-minded set of beliefs either imposed, adopted, or rejected. The Religion of Tomorrow is open-source, co-created, and personally developed. And as more and more creatives recognize the significance of such a task, more and more myths will spread among us, providing people material they can adopt or adapt as they see fit, as fits their psychic needs. In this religion of tomorrow, not everyone needs to be a creative mythmaker, just as in our current digital world not everyone is necessarily creating memes or recording podcasts. Artists create for themselves, but also for the world. So, too, the mythopoets to come. What gets created can become a mythological commons, open to inspire meaning in others, and fair use for development and adaptation. For either by transformation, adaptation, invention, or propagation, we can all be co-creating the sacred." - [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/post/reconstructing-religion#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20need,creating%20the%20sacred.)

> "When we speak of God, we are, perforce, speaking mythologically. The very word “God” carries with it millennia of connotation, association, and depth—an aura of awesomness, a patina of profundity. What if our new mythology was itself rooted in the narrative of working with God to realize God’s self in the world? To assist God in God’s coming-to-be? Perhaps we see all religious traditions as participatory in this great endeavor. Perhaps this effort has been unfolding for millennia, as elements of God came online, now in Egypt, now in Mesopotamia, India, China, Palestine. Perhaps we stand at the edge of an unprecedented period, to which these various developments have been leading: our conscious awareness of God’s transformation and humanity’s role in the process. What has hitherto been unfolding haphazardly over the centuries can now become intentional, conscious, deliberate, as human beings turn to myth, to art, to poetry, to sculpt the latent God out of the rock of time, in order that God can become more what God has been becoming all this time.

Turtles all the way down
Alignment all the way down

This is a fight for conscious life itself
The fight of our lives
