> "Without improving the systems by which humans collectively navigate the problem of mapping values to actions under shared constraints, that better tech will primarily end up used to destroy humanity, rather than sustainably accelerate it. The belief that better / more capable technological artifacts will alone lead to a better society is just another form of utopian delusion." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1770602256901243331)

> "In the realm of machine learning and AI... the greatest existential threat lies with the emergent human reaction to a rate of functional displacement that exceeds the rate at which humans can adapt. We're quite the adaptive species, but our flexibility is not infinite over finite time horizons, nor is our ability to purposefully redirect our lives an instantaneous property" - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1765499438733386025)

> "We may view the growing attraction to islands of ideological stability as similar to the instinctual clustering of shipwreck survivors around the remaining pieces of flotsam. Like these lost souls, we find ourselves adrift in the rising tide of novel phenomenological complexity that flows from our rivers of hyper-connectivity. Alas, such survivors’ days are numbered, absent outside intervention.

> And herein lies the paradox of this behavior: the probability of outside intervention is zero. We’re part of an emergent system, and therefore if the ship goes down, no one will come to the aid of humanity.

> Thus the primary questions within this time of extreme phenomenological transformation concern the kinds of structures that we may build from the fragments of prior stratified forms, namely: how might we create modes of communication–novel inter-perspectival grammars–capable of sparking cooperation amongst the different clusters of survivors, otherwise adrift and on the clock?" - [On The Phenomenology of Hyper-Connectivity, by Matthew Pirkowski](https://medium.com/@matthewpirkowski/on-the-phenomenology-of-hyper-connectivity-b04d7d191129#:~:text=we%20may%20view,on%20the%20clock%3F)

> 1/ Peer-to-peer systems with skin in the game are exemplified in the Web of Trust concept. The main innovation here is that there is no central object to capture, and every agent speaks only for itself and its connections. With no central "home page" or other global object, [Sybil attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sybil-attack) lose their potency, especially when the agents in the system keep track over time and losing a long-aged/highly-trusted account becomes costly as the agent has to start over from scratch.

> 2. While this kind of approach will get us to a place somewhat similar to Twitter (minus the "trending" centralized object), we want to build a community that is more truth-oriented than Twitter. This is where triangulation and "the motion parallax of time" (aka. predictions) come into play. The shared, un-gameable global object all participants have access to is called "underlying reality", featuring the passage of time... Someone building a predictive record with a history of being more correct than others, creates a hard-to-fake signal for the objective value of this account. And much in the spirit of the ELO rating system in chess, observers can then use these predictions to construct a mostly-objective ranking of the various pundits in their field of vision. It may require them to be able to mostly-correctly identify whose predictions have been correct in the past, but that is a far easier task than predicting the future or choosing between different pundits arguing over an issue without access to prior track records. It's up to each agent to evaluate others' track record, and they have skin in the game to lose.

An upvote or a downvote implies strengthening or weakening the connection of the user to the other user(s) that were the conduits to get any particular item visible to this user. The ultimate result of such a dynamic, distributed, weighted and directed graph would be for the overall system to start operating as a bayesian network. Cycles may occur, and can be resolved using known methods from BN literature." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1450012197262741510)
