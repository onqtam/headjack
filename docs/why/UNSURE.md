> "Reading a tweet is a bit like downloading an (attacker-controlled) executable that you instantly run on your brain. Each one elicits emotions, suggests knowledge, nudges world-view. In the future it might feel surprising that we allowed direct, untrusted information to brain." - [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1766509149297189274)



> "The Internet is to America what America was to Britain. A frontier territory that will ultimately succeed even its worthy progenitor." - [Balaji](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1774529076742754328)


> "Without improving the systems by which humans collectively navigate the problem of mapping values to actions under shared constraints, that better tech will primarily end up used to destroy humanity, rather than sustainably accelerate it. The belief that better / more capable technological artifacts will alone lead to a better society is just another form of utopian delusion." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1770602256901243331)

> "Our ability to match acceleration to the appropriate constraints, as those constraints emerge within view, constitutes the parameter with the highest predictive power concerning adaptive / maladaptive outcomes." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1765499438733386025)

> "In the realm of machine learning and AI... the greatest existential threat lies with the emergent human reaction to a rate of functional displacement that exceeds the rate at which humans can adapt. We're quite the adaptive species, but our flexibility is not infinite over finite time horizons, nor is our ability to purposefully redirect our lives an instantaneous property" - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1765499438733386025)

> "Societal evolution parallels that of biology. The complex structures within animals evolved to mediate internal communication flows over millions of years. In societal terms, the Internet connected all of our people cells, practically overnight. We’re now having a seizure." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/977773224397217792)

> "We will rise or fall to the level of our cultural affordances." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1757530236894552448)

> "We may view the growing attraction to islands of ideological stability as similar to the instinctual clustering of shipwreck survivors around the remaining pieces of flotsam. Like these lost souls, we find ourselves adrift in the rising tide of novel phenomenological complexity that flows from our rivers of hyper-connectivity. Alas, such survivors’ days are numbered, absent outside intervention.

> And herein lies the paradox of this behavior: the probability of outside intervention is zero. We’re part of an emergent system, and therefore if the ship goes down, no one will come to the aid of humanity.
>
> Thus the primary questions within this time of extreme phenomenological transformation concern the kinds of structures that we may build from the fragments of prior stratified forms, namely: how might we create modes of communication–novel inter-perspectival grammars–capable of sparking cooperation amongst the different clusters of survivors, otherwise adrift and on the clock?" - [On The Phenomenology of Hyper-Connectivity, by Matthew Pirkowski](https://medium.com/@matthewpirkowski/on-the-phenomenology-of-hyper-connectivity-b04d7d191129#:~:text=we%20may%20view,on%20the%20clock%3F)
