With no central "home page" or other global object, [Sybil attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sybil-attack) lose their potency, especially when the agents in the system keep track over time and losing a long-aged/highly-trusted account becomes costly as the agent has to start over from scratch.

> 2. While this kind of approach will get us to a place somewhat similar to Twitter (minus the "trending" centralized object), we want to build a community that is more truth-oriented than Twitter. This is where triangulation and "the motion parallax of time" (aka. predictions) come into play. The shared, un-gameable global object all participants have access to is called "underlying reality", featuring the passage of time... Someone building a predictive record with a history of being more correct than others, creates a hard-to-fake signal for the objective value of this account. And much in the spirit of the ELO rating system in chess, observers can then use these predictions to construct a mostly-objective ranking of the various pundits in their field of vision. It may require them to be able to mostly-correctly identify whose predictions have been correct in the past, but that is a far easier task than predicting the future or choosing between different pundits arguing over an issue without access to prior track records. It's up to each agent to evaluate others' track record, and they have skin in the game to lose.
