The belief that better / more capable technological artifacts will alone lead to a better society is just another form of utopian delusion." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://twitter.com/MattPirkowski/status/1770602256901243331)

> "We may view the growing attraction to islands of ideological stability as similar to the instinctual clustering of shipwreck survivors around the remaining pieces of flotsam. Like these lost souls, we find ourselves adrift in the rising tide of novel phenomenological complexity that flows from our rivers of hyper-connectivity. Alas, such survivors’ days are numbered, absent outside intervention.

> And herein lies the paradox of this behavior: the probability of outside intervention is zero. We’re part of an emergent system, and therefore if the ship goes down, no one will come to the aid of humanity.

> Thus the primary questions within this time of extreme phenomenological transformation concern the kinds of structures that we may build from the fragments of prior stratified forms, namely: how might we create modes of communication–novel inter-perspectival grammars–capable of sparking cooperation amongst the different clusters of survivors, otherwise adrift and on the clock?" - [On The Phenomenology of Hyper-Connectivity, by Matthew Pirkowski](https://medium.com/@matthewpirkowski/on-the-phenomenology-of-hyper-connectivity-b04d7d191129#:~:text=we%20may%20view,on%20the%20clock%3F)

> 1/ Peer-to-peer systems with skin in the game are exemplified in the Web of Trust concept. The main innovation here is that there is no central object to capture, and every agent speaks only for itself and its connections. With no central "home page" or other global object, [Sybil attacks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/sybil-attack) lose their potency, especially when the agents in the system keep track over time and losing a long-aged/highly-trusted account becomes costly as the agent has to start over from scratch.

> 2. While this kind of approach will get us to a place somewhat similar to Twitter (minus the "trending" centralized object), we want to build a community that is more truth-oriented than Twitter. This is where triangulation and "the motion parallax of time" (aka. predictions) come into play. The shared, un-gameable global object all participants have access to is called "underlying reality", featuring the passage of time... Someone building a predictive record with a history of being more correct than others, creates a hard-to-fake signal for the objective value of this account. And much in the spirit of the ELO rating system in chess, observers can then use these predictions to construct a mostly-objective ranking of the various pundits in their field of vision. It may require them to be able to mostly-correctly identify whose predictions have been correct in the past, but that is a far easier task than predicting the future or choosing between different pundits arguing over an issue without access to prior track records. It's up to each agent to evaluate others' track record, and they have skin in the game to lose.

> "Brains operate...not by logic but by pattern recognition. This process is not precise, as is logic and mathematics. Instead, it trades off specificity and precision, if necessary, to increase its range. It is likely, for example, that early human thought proceeded by metaphor, which, even with the late acquisition of precise means such as logic and mathematical thought, continues to be a major source of imagination and creativity in adult life." - [Gerald Edelman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7704253-brains-operate-not-by-logic-but-by-pattern-recognition-this-process)


> "Hayek made a quite fruitful suggestion, made contemporaneously by the psychologist Donald Hebb, that whatever kind of encounter the sensory system has with the world, a corresponding event between a particular cell in the brain and some other cell carrying the information from the outside word must result in reinforcement of the connection between those cells. These day, this is known as a Hebbian synapse, but von Hayek quite independently came upon the idea. I think the essence of his analysis still remains with us." - [Gerald Edelman](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1457170)
