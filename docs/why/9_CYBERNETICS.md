> "Relevance is like biological fittedness. It is cognitive fittedness." - [John Vervaeke](https://twitter.com/tomowenmorgan/status/1742174771196866796)

> "You face a problem - in fact it's a meta problem whenever you're trying to do any problem solving - this is the following problem: the amount of information available to you is combinatorily explosive, it is vast, it is overwhelming. The amount of things you could pay attention to in this room - you could look at that spot right there, or that spot, or the relationship between the spots - you can do that, you're capable of it. When you think about it carefully now: the amount of ways you could look at this room and attend to it is combinatorially explosive. It is vast. The amount of information you have in your long-term memory and the possible combinations - it's huge. You could think of an aardvark, you could think of the Aztec empire, you could think of the beginning of the gold standard, and you could possibly even connect them all together. Think of all the ways you can connect all the things in your long-term memory. All the sequences of actions - I'm going to solve a problem - I'm going to start moving my body around, I can move this finger, then this finger could move these two, I could grab I could lift my hands, like oh I can sing - out of all the possible combinations you somehow zero in on the right thing to do, the right thing to pay attention to, and the right things to be remembering right now. You zero in on the relevant information and you ignore most - overwhelmingly most - of the irrelevant information. You frame your cognition and you pay attention only to what's within that frame and you ignore what's outside of that frame. It sounds paradoxical but this is the case - you're intelligent because of your capacity to ignore so much information." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=730)

> "Relevance realization is the name I give to a process which I argue is central to general intelligence. Your general intelligence is your capacity to solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains. For most of the problems you face the interrelated tasks of selecting what you are to pay attention to, what you are going to remember, and what you are going to do. The problem facing attention is that the amount of information available to you is astronomically vast. You have to ignore most of it, which is a lot of information. You cannot just arbitrarily guess what you should attend to nor can you methodically check all the information for that would take more time than your lifetime. There is a similar problem facing memory. Your long term memory stores a vast amount of knowledge, and the number of ways that information can be combined is astronomically vast. Similarly, all the possible sequences of actions which you could undertake is astronomically vast. Yet, moment by moment you are neither guessing nor methodically checking all the information, all your memory, or all the options for action. You are homing in on the relevant information while remembering the information relevant to your situation and selecting a relevant course of action. What is so impressive is how this is all obvious to you, and it is very often relevant to the context you are in and to the problem at hand. You can rely on the obviousness of your experience and that it is reliably sensitive to context. However, cognitive science has to explain how you generate such obviousness such that it is contextually sensitive to solving your problems. Saying that relevance is obvious or depends on context does not solve the problem because this merely renames the problem of relevance realization as the problem of generating a sense of the relevance of information in a contextually sensitive manner, and how do we do that? To say we learn it by experience is not helpful because to say we learn is to say that we zero in on relevant information in order to solve our problems. This learning cannot be arbitrary association nor can it use exhaustive examination of situations. Learning presupposes relevance realization and therefore cannot explain it. I currently have a paper under review, where my coauthors and I argue that relevance realization is probably convergent with the precision weighting at the core of predictive processing models. This convergence adds significant theoretical plausibility to the proposal that relevance realization is central to intelligence." - [John Vervaeke](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-summary-of-relevance-realization-according-to-John-Vervaeke)

> "Somehow problem solvers reliably (but not perfectly) zero in on the relevant information to be investigated. They do not do this abstractly, but in the way they formulate the problem. How individuals represent the initial state, goal state, operations, and path constraints, is the way in which they attempt to zero in on relevant information. Problem formulation is how problem solvers constrain the search space of a particular problem so that heuristics can effectively apply to it. Problem formulation captures what problem solvers deem relevant to a specific problem, and this formulation helps them to intelligently ignore most of the information in the search space. To intelligently ignore means that problem solvers do not even consider most available information, and they find and focus upon information that turns out to be relevant without comparing it to all the irrelevant information that is available." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Consider how we are beset by ill-defined problems all day long such as following and/or joining a conversation successfully, getting and/or telling a joke or telling a story. As such, we frequently have to generate problem formulations in order to both address ill-definedness and to avoid combinatorial explosion. Not only do we have to zero in on relevant information, we often have to generate missing relevant information in order to do so. Problem formulation handles both of these demands and is a primary way in which we do relevance realization within problem solving.
>
> However, sometimes the problem formulation constrains a problem in such a way so that it cannot be solved; the problem formulation itself becomes problematic. In these circumstances, the problem formulations need to be broken up and reformulated. The solver must have an insight: their relevance realization abilities have to be flexibly recursive and self-correcting. They have to realize that they have misformulated the problem and be capable of generating a new relevance profile that then informs a new, more effective formulation." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Truly the ability to determine relevance is foundational to our intelligence and would be central to any SmartData system." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "We never represent all the properties of anything because we are in the finitary predicament. We always only represent a subset of any real world things. This subset of features and how they hang together is an aspect. All representation is aspectual. Yet an aspect is a zeroing in on properties deemed relevant, and a formulation of those properties as highly relevant to each other and to oneself and others. The ability to represent crucially presupposes the ability to realize relevance and therefore cannot serve as a basis of explaining it without circularity." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Relevance realization must be happening at a level of analysis more basic than standard information processing. Yet it cannot be handled by some central processor because that processor would face a combinatorial explosion of information facing it even within the brain’s own processing. The processing of relevance realization has to happen as a constraint on all processing both local and global within the brain. Relevance realization has to be internal, sub-semantic, sub-syntactic, and scale invariant in its operations. Finally, it must be completely self-organizing because it has to be a self-correcting and self-transforming process." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "McKee and Barber note that it is not just any kind of insight that constitutes wisdom. Rather it is some kind of insight through illusion and into reality. Meeks and Jeste indicate that the insight involved in wisdom also has importantly to do with self‐reflection/self‐understanding. The connection here is that illusion is some form of self‐deception, so seeing through illusion and into reality involves important insight into one’s own cognition and how it might be impeding contact with reality." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions. Taken together, combinatorial complexity in problem solving, the largely ill-defined nature of most problems and the consideration of consequences serve to indicate the centrality of our relevance realization machinery. Thus, relevance realization is central; it involves the ability to frame our cognition and, most importantly, to do this flexibly, i.e. to be able to reframe. This ability to reframe how we find things relevant is sometimes experienced as the “aha” moment called insight." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Relevance realization is always a matter of the selective direction of attention, the appraisal of value, and the rationing and commitment of processing resources. Relevance realization is simultaneously attentional, affective, and motivational. Relevance realization largely concerns how you care about and care for information." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Evolutionary processes are constantly redefining from within evolution what it means to be fit. Relevance realization must constantly be redefining from within relevance realization what it means for information to be relevant." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)
