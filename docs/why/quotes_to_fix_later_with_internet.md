Instead of confronting the problems inherent in an oligarchy, democracy denies it exists while practicing it openly. Oligarchy is not necessary, but it can only be overcome in a completely open and transparent system which allows the most widespread participation by all and knowledge for all and recognizes and accommodates expertise and greater levels of knowledge." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Representative democracies do not provide for expertise in governance as representatives are elected by land mass and time span, not system, and are usually elected for charisma, not expertise. Athenian sortition likewise made no attempt at combining expertise with authority. Subjects that the majority is unqualified to speak on are delegated to similarly unqualified political representatives, segregated from other representatives by land mass. These representatives appoint experts who obtain their positions by cronyism with the politician instead of expertise acknowledged by the entire interested population.
>
> The politicians and experts in the current system then provide for no meaningful feedback from users of the system, outside of occasional polls. These polls are conducted on test populations which another group have decided shall be considered representative of the population as a whole and used to provide input on only the questions the experts decide. There is no transparency of any meaningful kind that would allow users of the system to audit what the experts were doing.

> We can do better than this. We can govern by user groups, respect individual rights and global commons, and collaborate using stigmergy. We can belong to overlapping societies voluntarily by acceptance of social contracts.

> "The idea that only a lawyer can understand the law was created to disguise the undermining of the basic principles of society. In order for a social contract to be binding, the principles must be easily taught to anyone, including children.

The discouragement people once faced for obtaining online medical advice, particularly from their peers, is greatly compounded for legal advice. This must change. People must recreate the legal systems to work for them, and that requires direct involvement at every level in the creation and implementation of the laws.

Transparency in its literal sense, not selected pieces of isolated information wrapped up and presented by an official but full transparency, of the kind that would allow any passerby to see exactly what an organization was up to. As the current powers have been asking private individuals for decades, what do they have to hide? The kind of radical transparency that private individuals have been exposed to needs to be turned on all organizations and actions which have any impact on the public.

> "Representative democracies are part of a personality driven celebrity culture where people are encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups in any action they take. This has changed from recent history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated. People were encouraged to choose principles they supported and ensure those principles were met by any action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a personality driven system to those in power is it allows them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than simply negotiating each action on its own merits." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While intellectual property rights need to be abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the copyright or patent holders. Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is as common now as ever for a person with access to powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable to reach the public and use it to enhance their own reputation... Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use their work to glorify another." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While most action based systems can be completely open to participation by anyone, there are situations where an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or engineering are examples of this type of work. While accreditation can and should come from the user group and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in many cases can only be reviewed by those who have attained an above average level of specialized knowledge. In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of expertise attached to specific people, a situation not compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
>
> Idea based systems such as some scientific research, which should be open to all contributions, require extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual users. In many specialized systems such as the pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in every system which affects them, even if that information is completely transparent and available to all. In these systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users qualified to understand them.
>
> It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
>
> In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice must always be left with the entire user group. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only. Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains with the entire user group and the epistemic community is forced to remain completely transparent and permeable. Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user group controls whether those are implemented or created. This authority also provides the incentive for transparency and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "It is the responsibility of each user in an open system to educate themselves to their own level of comfort using the data and user population at each level to inform themselves. Their input and decision making impact would then be commensurate with the expertise they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users.

> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action.

> "Big history could be a chance to develop, eventually, a collective map making process to orient and guide humanity into the deeper future. What does it mean for future human action to be connected in a chain of evolutionary processes from the emergence of spacetime to the present? In this context big history has the opportunity to become simultaneously one story of our shared world as well as an infinite number of stories of how individuals can relate to that world and act in that world... Consequently, big history offers humanity a deeper perspective and an opportunity for cosmic reflection in relation to the meaning of human life from an exploration of the processes that culminated in our existence." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As a general principle, the more faithfully a society can store and transmit cultural information between cultural beings and across cultural generations, the less functional cultural information is lost (i.e. ‘backward slippage’), and the easier it becomes for any given cultural collective to build upon the complexity of inherited cultural knowledge (i.e. ‘ratcheting’). In this sense, the speed of cultural change is a rough function of the qualitative efficiency and quantitative number of conversations (i.e. idea sharing/sex) being conducted within and between individuals and populations." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We need different modes of sociopolitical governance. Complex systems science teaches us that local, bottom-up and distributed coordination are typically the most effective and capable mechanisms for enabling emergent global order in highly complex environments. This is because, in complex systems, there are simply too many differentiated parts for effective top- down mechanisms for coordination to stably function and synergize the whole. Thus any global systems science and serious sociopolitical global development agenda must understand how to maintain a new planetary organization with dynamic and distributed mechanisms that lead to self-organization (as opposed to static and hierarchical historical mechanisms that produce centralized organization)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

According to MST, higher levels of control organization can emerge from the coordination of less ordered subsystems. This type of higher coordination is hypothesized to emerge from the selection for more advanced information processing and communications, which enables previously disparate entities to synergistically coordinate their activities. Consequently, such systemic transitions change the relationship between the parts they are composed of, and (if successful) lead towards new emergent and stable characteristics of the whole, through the exploration of (in our context) new (sociotechnological) connections, new (sociotechnological) distinctions, and consequently, new (sociotechnological) possibility spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We must fundamentally rethink the nature of human controls: without the courage to acknowledge that nation-states are inadequate structures, globalization is ‘just a sham’. Part of the problem is that the psychology of the modern mind has been so fundamentally shaped by the nation-state that it is difficult for most to imagine the structure of a different world. However, remaining symbolically faithful to the nation-state, when its function as a structural control is so clearly endangering socioeconomic and ecological progress is dangerous as many of our most pressing problems related to economics, ecology and social space do not have borders (i.e. they are global, with an earth-space boundary only)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The emergence of the internet has created the foundations for an increasingly global world. In this context we must consider ways to approach a new form of globalization that is shaped by the whole of humanity. This will require a metasystem transition toward a higher level of systems complexity by reinventing the established control hierarchy. This reinvention could allow for the establishment of controls that maximize distributed intelligence and direct democracy within a digital medium that functions from ‘local to global’. Of course, this will require massive control innovation and a cultural revolution committed to radical distribution of concentrated power. Here we can learn from the founders of enlightenment if we have the daring to actually realize their transcendent dreams. There is no reason why control needs to possess a specific physical location in a truly mature information age. Instead, power could be distributed among all interconnected citizens in a multipolar Global Village. Such an organization should allow us to safely navigate the next frontier metasystem of humanity’s evolutionary experiment." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In the democratic form a small group of agents still defines problems and explores opportunities but must undergo constant change and replacement, and also must be subjected to constant feedback processes from the populous as a whole. In the theoretical commons form the center loses its ‘agential dimension’ and instead emerges from the collective interaction of agential consciousness. In this sense the center gains its coherence only from the distributed problem definition and opportunity exploration of the network of agential consciousness in-itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The failure of religious institutions, particular the Abrahamic religious institutions, to become more decentralized and distributed has arguably defined by their controversial existence throughout the industrial era. Indeed the majority of the atheist critique of religion has little to do with serious transcendental arguments related to the existence or nonexistence of God, and much more to do with social system repression, power and control, which is a feature of centralized and hierarchical organizations. Moreover there has been a recent flourishing of spiritual belief systems and spiritual practices that are capable of expressing the human relationship to the divine without the strict adherence to a single text or scripture.
>
> In this nuanced perspective it becomes difficult to know exactly how to interpret the future of religion with any absolute certainty. However, in the challenge propagation framework we can say that the future of spirituality or belief in the supernatural must figure out how to reinvent itself within the context of a structural reorganization of how humans relate to the spirit. Humans have inherent spiritual needs and these needs can manifest in many different ways. In order to foster this spiritual need for faith in a higher power or source or cause of existence the best practice in a challenge propagation framework would be to create the discursive spaces where a real active dialogue about spirituality and faith can emerge. These discursive spaces need not represent one religious leader or one religious domination but allow for conceptual boundaries to be flexible and dynamic and contingent on the needs expressed in the dialogue.
>
> If this model is useful in a prescriptive and predictive context then the future spiritual communities will be built on distributed emergence, without the need for permanent leaders, authorities or denomination. This in fact mirrors the patterns we discussed in regards to the future of governance. In essence, religious organizations need to become more decentralized and distributed so that ideas of how the human spirit or consciousness relates to its existential condition can be expressed with less friction or distortion. This would allow different religious groups or identities to move past any theological divisions and find a common meaning or purpose for the twenty-first century that is more in-line with religion’s core drive which is to provide an outlet for people to explore their relationship to the unknown or unknowable.

> In this context religion can be revived by focusing on the very real dimension of problems for consciousness that have no final or complete answer but are rather fundamental mysteries of the historical process. Some of these very real dimensions include an understanding of universal ethics or morality, the structure of life and death, the design or construction or creation of the universe and the meaning of society and experience in a cosmic context. These dimensions of inquiry are as pressing for contemporary consciousness as they have ever been for consciousness. Thus the possibility for a revived understanding of spirituality and human relation to religion is now an informational potentiality which requires us to rethink a meaningful structure to information control." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The theoretical emphasis in technological singularity literature (i.e. emergence of AGI) almost completely ignores the systemic dynamics of technological revolution in relation to the emerging sociotechnological sphere mediated by the totality of the internet as universal medium. In missing this systemic dynamic the technological singularity literature fails to even confront basic issues of systemic transitions in relation to control, power and hierarchy, and thus basic issues of systemic transitions in terms of social, economic and political life." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the AGI technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on individual machine-learning programs that enter ‘self-recursive cycles’ of exponential intellect improvement towards ‘post-humanity’. However, in the GB technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on collective global issues and metasystemic transitions related to power, control and hierarchy. This is not to say that the GB technological singularity vision totally negates the possibility of the emergence of AGI or even post-humanity, but rather approaches the emerging technological revolution as a phenomenon that must be grounded in the totality of sociotechnological process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In this sense what is wrong with most socioeconomic or sociotechnological thinking today is that it precisely ignores the most important element, i.e. the subjective dimension of socio-processes. At the structural ‘micro-foundations’ of capitalism is the subjective valuation of profit as hegemonic to all other forms of value. Thus, in the same way that a few people thinking in a new way about money and what to do with money due to the rise of new forms of industrial productive potential in the 19th century changed the socioeconomic conditions of the human world (i.e. universal subjective valuation of profit maximization via market exchange over and above all other values), we should again, simply, go back to the ‘micro-foundations’, think new forms of subjective valuation, and draw out their large-scale socioeconomic consequences, i.e. what would be the resulting ‘macro-foundations’ as ‘large-scale political collectives’ that developed due to new ‘micro-foundations’?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom set out to articulate how the ‘state/market’ could be broken with a ‘radical third’ of a commons as ‘institutions for collective action’ with a specific focus on their establishment and management. In other words, instead of systems controlling property and labour (nation-states), or systems producing and consuming commodities (markets), the commons are systems for managing and distributing shared resources and spaces with a core of direct democracy (as opposed to representative democracy). For Ostrom, one of the key notions for the successful establishment and maintenance of a commons based on access is how these systems identify and properly manage ‘Common Pool Resources’ (CPR), which she identifies as resources and spaces that are inherently ‘common’ but also ‘scarce’ and thus ‘rival’. In other words, overcoming the problem of establishing and managing CPRs in a commons is the foundation for ‘de-commodification’ and ‘opening a commonwealth’, and perhaps, the key shift in transforming neoliberal institutions (and the multinational corporations that thrive under their reign) into commons institutions capable of establishing an automated and collaborative commons.
>
> In this frame a resource/space an be generally defined as a CPR if one agent/persons use of the resource/space will subtract from any other agent/persons use and where it is often necessary, but difficult and costly, to exclude another agent/persons use outside the group from using the resource/space. Here there are numerous and extremely diverse examples of such ‘rival/scarce’ resources/spaces that could be classified as a ‘CPR’: fishers, grazing grounds, parks, farms, transportation grids, and so forth. In Ostrom’s analysis of systems for collective action that benefit the common good (i.e. higher levels of cooperation) there are always simple yet fundamental problems related to (Ostrom 1990, p. 27):
>
> A) Coping with free-riding
>
> B) Solving commitment problems
>
> C) Arranging for the supply of new institutions, and
>
> D) Monitoring individual compliance with sets of rules

> Furthermore, Ostrom did not just identify the problems that prevent the emergence and stabilization of commons institutions for collective action, but also identified key ‘design principles’ that can solve these problems, which include (Ostrom 1990, p. 90):
>
> A) Group boundaries clearly defined
>
> B) Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions

>
> The first thing for GB theorists to note here is the difficulty in understanding and implementing the relation between the ‘local’ dimension and the ‘global’ dimension. In other words, although both the automated and collaborative functions of the commons would ideally fall within a universal medium that intelligently satisfied all human necessities - some form of ‘post- monetary’ ‘offer network’ (Goertzel 2015; Heylighen 2016b) - this universal medium must also be nested in order to meet CPR demands on multiple interacting levels, e.g. regional, continental, international and global. On the practical level there are functions of human civilization that operate on different levels of organization, e.g. regional health facilities require different commons demands than do international transportation networks or global environmental problems, etc. But on the second societal and cultural level there is the simple fact that real groups and communities exist at multiple levels with specific needs and desires that cannot be totally ignored and replaced with a totalizing and ideological abstract universalism (i.e. ‘We are all One world community, and so forth’). Thus, the point of Ostrom’s commons ‘design principles’ is that, although they complicate the situation of establishing and maintaining a commons, they are at the same time necessary preconditions for the commons long-term viability as well the growth of pluralism and diversity within a new universal level of organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter- intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self- reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "When we think of the technocultural era in big historical terms we are not so much confronted with the future of ‘humans’ (as we typically think of humans) but the future of self-designed intelligent-spiritual ‘beings’ self-organized towards a higher level of thought... The technological singularity concept forces us to imagine a black hole of experience, an event horizon beyond which we could know nothing for certain about the deep future. In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The combination of higher energy flow, information processing, cultural differentiation and sociopolitical integration could create the foundations for an emergent organization with a far higher possibility space than any historical society. This shift will include a qualitative leap in all of the dimensions of our personal lives, including how we relate to our own mind and life, how we relate to the world, and how we relate to each other (not to mention who we call ‘we’) (Hofstadter 2003). Historically, these dimensions of our experience have been shaped by our evolved biological perceptions, the replication of our symbolic structures, and the sociopolitical structures of historical civilization. However, in a technocultural world the mechanisms for sensory perception, replication of symbolic structures and sociopolitical organization will all have foundationally changed, likely leading towards a planetary network of unprecedented cultural and technological creation: tens of billions of minds in free association, exploring deeper levels of interconnection, and internal/external reflection than possible within a purely biological substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Being are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Beyond immortality the deepest possibilities and surprises of the technocultural world will likely come, not from radical life extension, but from radical life expansion, in terms of cognitive growth and interconnection. Therefore, when we explore the technocultural world experientially, we reach a world of deeply integrated minds in planetary interconnection, and whatever that interconnection will birth." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cyberneticist Valentin Turchin thoughtfully contemplated the possibility of a deeply integrated human super-being (1977, p. 259): “How far will integration of individuals go?

> "Art was a qualitative emergence that resulted from the increased informational transfer abilities acquired through the expansion of the neocortex and the evolution of language. Of course the same goes for the other uniquely human cultural activities like sciences, poetry, philosophy, mathematics, music, etc. Thus in the past we have clear evidence that quantitative increases in brain capacity can lead to the radical emergence of new qualitative properties which then proceed to play a dominant causal role in future evolutionary processes. What new symbolic or mind properties will emerge from a further technological expansion of the neocortex and further evolution of language towards closer mind-to-mind communication? And what will emerge from the new ecosystems of purely technological mind?
>
> Technocultural beings will be able to share extraordinary high levels of information at the speed of light, and via much more reliable mechanisms, likely via direct mind connection with others and with our collective computer networks (i.e. our ‘digital twins’ or ‘personal AIs’) (Kurzweil 2014). That is to say that the (practically) instant transmission of information files (for example: books, movies, music, photographs etc.) could be transferred between minds directly and understood near-instantaneously. All minds would have a dramatically expanded understanding of acquired knowledge, allowing for an unprecedented level of ‘cultural ratcheting’ (Tennie et al. 2009) or ‘collective learning’ (Christian 2004). The generational barriers towards knowledge transfer may even by completely overcome. Beings would also be able to communicate vast reaches of their mind through virtual recreations of any and all varieties in mediums of expression that currently do not exist.

> "A more interesting framing of religion is to view it as the fabric that ties society together. And what tied traditional societies of a distant past together obviously won’t be able to take on that role today. However, weaving this shared social fabric of religion may be the only way we know of to organise society past the Dunbar number. A broader definition of religion would also include our stories about technology, art, nation states, etc. Geertz defines religion as a “system of symbols which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in society”.

> Any widely shared beliefs, stories, and practices could be conceived of as religious in this broader definition that we are considering here. From trust in the institution of science to the story of progress through globalisation to the ritual of accepting printed paper for goods - it’s all religious in this broader framing.

> Layman Pascal proposes that religion is fundamentally about the harmonisation and integration of culture, technology, politics, etc. at a given time and place. If this religious integration is successful, it results in an excess of meaning and coherence that can translate into a numinous experience that binds communities together. From this point of view, religion stops seeming like an antiquated mode of superstition. Rather, the emergence of a religion that creates a right integration and surplus coherence for our times suddenly seems like an urgent priority.

Yet more and more find it impossible to believe the silly dogmas of the cultural fossils we generally call “religion”, or to participate in their dead rituals.

Many of them tie in with great religious traditions and philosophers alike (Hegel, Whitehead, Bergson, de Chardin). A re-integration therefore does not seem out of reach, and we will continue to see more convincing attempts. The prototypical example is Wilber’s Integralism, and more recently, Metamodernism.

Always on its way to the guillotine.” This allows for an anti- fragile dynamic where whatever belief structures are left after ferocious critique can be believed in with much more conviction. This constant critique also acts as a pruning function to get rid of structures no longer needed. Since our God is anti- fragile, there should be no hesitation in tearing down any narratives that are disproven by our scientific advances and reconstructing ones that better reflect reality." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

Self-aware narrativity is also how we might hope that an increasing number of people will resonate with the stories we come up with: Any valid critique and additions that are useful while being coherent should be included without hesitation. As time progresses, the petrified dogmas of traditional religions will become ever more inconsistent. All the while, the population on average develops further and Metamodern Religion will exert an inexorable pull on adherents of traditional religions. At the same time, more scientific minded people would notice that the stories are in agreement with their worldview but provide much more personal and collective meaningfulness, so they too would be tempted to join in.

> Metamodern religion will only feel intersubjectively real once a critical mass of “believers” subscribe to it. Just because we know that it’s just a story we made up doesn’t make it feel any less real. Even more so, we can believe it because we know we made it up. There is a certain bootstrapping principle at play here that reminds of Alexander Bard’s Syntheos, the created God, and the concept of Hyperstition. Like a collective placebo effect, we might be surprised how real our headless God will feel once enough of us have agreed on a version we could believe in." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "How could such a convoluted structure possibly scale to a global religion? The answer is that not everybody has to understand it, they just need to participate in it. I can type these words without knowing how my laptop works. It is much easier to function within a given system than work on the systemic level itself. Only a small part of the population will be called to do the latter and both help Metamodern Religion emerge in the first place and then improve and maintain it. Whoever is called to this work will likely have a certain temperament and a certain level of development in specific areas. Whatever personality typology or developmental frameworks we might apply here, the conclusion will always be that it’s a rather small part of the population. Only these “shamanoid” personalities (as [Bard calls them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9gYpj0WLcg)) would need to understand the functioning of the structure as a whole and likely undergo significant training to take up their role as stewards or “priests” of Metamodern Religion." - [Cosmo-local coordination, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/cosmo-local-coordination)

> "New technology may be changing the relationship between democracy and expertise, affording an opportunity to improve competence by making good information available for better governance. Large-scale knowledge-sharing projects, such as the Wikipedia online encyclopedia, and volunteer software-programming initiatives, such as the Apache Webserver (which runs two-thirds of the websites in the world), demonstrate the inadequacy of our assumptions about expertise in the twenty-first century. Ordinary people, regardless of institutional affiliation or professional status, possess information–serious, expert, fact-based, scientific information–to enhance decision-making, information not otherwise available to isolated bureaucrats. Partly as a result of the simple tools now available for collaboration and partly as a result of a highly mobile labor market of "knowledge workers," people are ready and willing to share that information across geographic, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Speaking truth to power is easiest to do–and more accurate–when spoken not as an individual, but as a group. This has particular application to policymaking: Non-governmental participants have something more to offer than voting once a year–namely, good information. In much the same way that we devise legal procedures to ensure fairness in the courtroom or open deliberation in Congress, we can design technology–and the legal and policy framework to support it–that elicits specific, structured, and manageable input, not from individuals, but from collaborative groups. If we can harness the enthusiasm and knowledge of "netizens" to the legal and political processes generally reserved for citizens, we can produce government decision-making that is both more expert and, at the same time, more democratic." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "It turns out that professional status has much less bearing on the quality of information than we might assume, and that professionals–whether in politics or other domains–are notoriously unsuccessful at making informed predictions. Moreover, the traditional reliance on institutionalized expertise is fraught with political controversy. Sometimes these pre-selected scientists and outside experts are simply lobbyists passing by another name." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "We want to design practices for "collaborative governance," shared processes of responsibility in information-gathering and decision-making that combine the technical expertise of public experts with the legal standards of professional decision-makers. There are plenty of people with expertise to share if their knowledge can successfully be connected to those decision-makers who need it. It is not necessary to pre-select authenticated and known professionals when structures can be put in place to ensure that informational inputs are discernable, specific, well-labeled, and easy to search, sort, and use. An online system will not be without its own problems and abuses, but the assumption is that greater public participation, not in setting values but in supplying information or making sense of and connections between informational sources supplied by others, can substantively improve decision-making." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Our institutions of governance are characterized by a longstanding culture of professionalism in which bureaucrats–not citizens–are the experts. Until recently, we have viewed this arrangement as legitimate because we have not practically been able to argue otherwise. Now we have a chance to do government differently. We have the know-how to create "civic software" that will help us form groups and communities who, working together, can be more effective at informing decision-making than individuals working alone. We know from James Surowiecki’s book, The Wisdom of Crowds, as well as Simon and Schuster’s new MediaPredict project (which encourages readers to guess which manuscripts will become best-sellers), that technology can be used to aggregate predictions. But Peer- to-Patent is teaching us that we can go beyond the tallying of votes. While the general public has good instincts about value-based decisions and could be engaged betterto identify "big mistakes" (such as egregiously unfair media ownership rules), there are specific people out there who possess specific information about patents or trucks or chemicals whom we can now incorporate into our decision-making.
>
> Nor does it have to stop at patents. Scientists who currently give their time to review grant applications might be just as willing to contribute their knowledge to decision-making about the environment, transportation, nuclear power, and agriculture. Frequent travelers have useful information to share with homeland security officials about how to best organize security at airports. Economists, businesspeople, and lawyers know a great deal about financial markets, securities, and consumer protection. State Department officials do not possess better information than select graduate students in computer science about RFID chips for passports. Immigrants and welfare recipients have information based on lived as well as learned experience to contribute.
>
> In order to make it possible for ordinary, busy people to participate, and for government to make use of their knowledge, government must design the practices of public participation to enable groups, not just individuals, to participate. Agencies must crystallize the questions they ask of the public and embed those targeted practices into software. Of course, not even the best-designed civic software is going to stop government from making bad decisions or ignoring–willfully or otherwise–good information dropped in its lap. And there will be manipulation and gaming, to be sure. But these are not reasons to shy away from opening up the practices of governance, especially when those practices can evolve over time to respond to problems that may arise.
>
> Opening up closed decision-making also introduces a greater degree of transparency and accountability than we have had before. For example, even if Peer-to-Patent does not yield good research or prior art every time, many eyeballs on the application still encourage the inventor to do a better job of writing it and produce public debate and discussion about the application. It drives more information into the open and encourages the "liberation" of government data, not for its own sake, but as an enabler for engagement. And public involvement reminds the agency official that he is working for (and being watched by) the public." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "With new forms of digital institution-building, we have an opportunity to increase the legitimacy of governmental decisions. The tools–increasingly cheap, sometimes free–will not replace the professionals. Technology will not, by itself, make complex regulatory problems any more tractable, or eliminate partisan disputes about values. What this next generation of civic software can do, however, is introduce better information by enabling the expert public to contribute targeted information. In doing so, it can make possible practices of governance that are, at once, more expert and more democratic." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "This is the real force behind globalization: the observation that social, economical and cultural processes no longer are impeded by geographical borders or distances, but cover the world as a whole. This is most clear on the Internet, where you can exchange information virtually instantaneously, without being aware whether your correspondent is situated around the corner, or on the other side of the planet." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "The problem of overcoming the conflicts intrinsic to competitive relations is exemplified by the Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons. In different situations, different solutions have typically evolved. However, these solutions are all related, in the sense that they can be viewed as institutions in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. as socially agreed-upon systems of rules and control mechanisms for enforcing them, that regulate and coordinate interactions between agents so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "After a while, the network of trails will have stabilized so that individual animals only need to contribute a minimal effort to its maintenance. Thus, the influence of individual agents on the medium tends to decrease. On the other hand, as the network becomes more reliable and extensive, the influence of the medium on the agents’ activities increases. Eventually, the asymmetry is inverted: where initially we would see the agents as manipulating the medium, now it becomes more parsimonious to see the medium as directing the agents. The medium has turned into a mediator: it coordinates the individual activities so as to minimize friction or conflict, and to maximize synergy. The classic example of such an “active” coordination medium can be found in the pheromone trails that ants create while searching for food. The trail network functions like an external memory or “collective mental map” for the ant colony, directing the individual ants to the different food sources and the nest via the most efficient routes." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "There are limits to the reduction of physical friction: it becomes increasingly difficult to reduce the consumption of matter and energy simply because there is a minimal amount of matter/energy necessary for processes like feeding, movement, and construction. On the other hand, there is no clear limit to the reduction of informational or social friction, in that the losses of frictional interactions (negative - 12 -sum) can be turned into the gains of synergetic interactions (positive sum)." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "The remarkable efficiency of the Internet is at present still mostly physical or informational, not social. The Internet has grown so quickly that it has not had the time to evolve efficient institutions, i.e. collective systems of rules that coordinate individual actions. The result is a messy, confusing and constantly changing information landscape, that in principle offers immense benefits, but in practice only works reliably for a limited number of applications, while producing confusion, information overload, and various forms of “cybercrime”. As a result, an individual discovery published on the net may indeed change the world’s outlook within days, but the more likely outcome is that it will get buried within masses of other, mostly much less relevant information, and not receive the attention it deserves.
>
> In conclusion, the evolutionary dynamics underlying globalization has already led to a relatively efficient physical distribution of matter, energy and information across the globe, but still needs to produce the social institutions that go with it. This is not a very original observation: critics of the globalization of markets have pointed out that the extension of the free trade in goods and services needs to be counterbalanced by the further development of transnational institutions, such as UN, UNESCO, WHO, etc., to protect the rights of children, workers, consumers, cultural groups or the environment. The “stigmergic” theory proposed here, however, suggests a number of complementary mechanisms through which new types of institutions are likely to evolve.
>
> The main idea is that the external interaction medium, a role that is increasingly dominated by the Internet, will evolve into a mediator. This mediator will not only facilitate, but direct, and eventually control, interactions so as to maximize their synergy. To achieve that, the medium needs to develop a form of intelligent management of the communication processes it supports, leading to what may be called collective intelligence or distributed cognition. When this distributed intelligence spans the world, the resulting system may be called the Global Brain." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "The basic mechanism whereby useful paths are gradually reinforced, and less useful ones weakened, provides a very general heuristic to tackle a variety of problems. It can be seen as a quantitative, stigmergic instantiation of the mechanism of evolution itself: maintain and grow the fit (useful); reduce, and eventually eliminate, the unfit...
>
> Furthermore, the same mechanism seems to underlie learning in the brain: neuronal connections that are successfully used become stronger; the others become weaker. It is this analogy that initially inspired me to conceive of the World-Wide Web as a potential Global Brain. The web is a distributed network of documents connected by hyperlinks along which people travel (“surf”) from page to page... when people surfing the web end up in a particularly interesting page, they are likely to create one or more new links from their own pages pointing directly to it, thus shortcutting the long sequence they followed before finding it. This increases the number of links to the page, and the probability that other people would encounter it. The overall effect is captured by Google’s PageRank algorithm, which provides a measure of the importance of a website as determined by the links directly or indirectly pointing to it. This is another example of quantitative stigmergy: the actions of many independent agents (people inserting links) on a shared medium (the web) produce a collective ranking (PageRank) that helps other agents find the options (documents) most likely to be useful to them." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "Agent swarms can perform not only the equivalent of intuitive, subconscious processes of activation spreading through the brain, but of systematic, logical search and deduction. To achieve that, the knowledge in the web needs to be organized according to a consensual ontology, i.e. a formal system of categories and relationships. Developing such ontologies is the goal of the Semantic Web project. Given such a semantic network, a software agent could be programmed with a “grammar” of rules that tell it to only explore or return certain categories of nodes and links. A swarm of such agents should for example be able to find all birds that do not fly, or the most representative researchers (as measured e.g. by PageRank or citation impact) who have written about globalization and evolution, cite publications of Modelski, work in one of the NATO countries and have a PhD, so that you can invite them to your NATO-sponsored workshop.
>
> In conclusion, quantitative stigmergy is able to turn the web from a passive medium for communication and storage of information into an intelligent mediator that uses learning and inference mechanisms similar to those of the human brain to recommend to its users the actions, information sources, or people most likely to be helpful for their aims. To achieve this, the intelligent web draws on the experience and knowledge of its users collectively, as externalized in the “trace” of preferences they leave on the paths they have traveled." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "A major effect of stigmergy is the acceleration of evolution: a solution to an evolutionary problem found by one agent can now, by impressing it upon the medium, be used and improved by other agents. Since the medium benefits all agents’ fitness, there will be a selective pressure on the agents to find solutions that make the medium itself more powerful. The further the medium extends, and the easier it becomes for agents to interact with it, the quicker innovations will spread and undergo further improvements. This leads to a self-reinforcing process: improvement of the medium facilitates further innovation, which in turn helps improve the medium." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "Connectivity implies an increase in the number of agents one is interacting with, and therefore an increase in social complexity, with the concomitant threats of competition, conflict, and confusion. These problems too can be conceptualized most generally as a form of friction, i.e. the (generally unintended) obstruction of one agent’s actions by one or more other agents’ actions. As in the case of technological progress, the trial-and-error of evolution will tend to reduce this social friction by creating adapted institutions. Institutions, or more generally mediators, are systems that coordinate the activities of different agents so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy.
>
> A largely overlooked, but very powerful, mechanism for the spontaneous evolution of mediators is stigmergy, which relies on the medium or environment shared by the agents. Stigmergic interaction means that the change produced by one agent to the medium stimulates another agent to perform a complementary action, promoting their collective benefit even without any conscious intention to cooperate. Stigmergic activity will gradually reshape the passive medium into an active mediator, which elicits and directs the agents’ actions.
>
> The most “ephemeralized” example of the technological infrastructure underlying global connectivity is the Internet. A quick inspection shows that it provides a near ideal medium for stigmergic interaction: it instantaneously connects people all across the planet, is nearly always and everywhere available, can be used virtually without cost, is plastic enough to accommodate practically any “shape” or information that is imprinted upon it, while it will accurately register and store this information for as long as necessary. What it still lacks are the more evolved mediator functions. Yet, there already exist several examples of Internet services—such as the Google search engine or the Wikipedia website—that very successfully apply stigmergic principles to coordinate individual activities, thus offering their users a form of distributed intelligence well beyond the capabilities of a single individual.
>
> A straightforward extrapolation of this evolution that injects ever more intelligence into the Internet leads me to expect a near-term shift from World-Wide Web to Global Brain. The “Global Brain” is more than a fancy term for a large-scale intelligent system, though: the analogy runs much deeper. An analysis of the stigmergic mechanisms that seem most effective in supporting such distributed intelligence shows that they are virtually identical to the mechanisms used by the human brain. The quantitative stigmergy exemplified by “ant algorithms” is nearly identical to the process of Hebbian or reinforcement learning that differentially strengthens connections between neurons in the brain. The “ants” that trace and explore the quantitatively weighted network formed in this way correspond to human or software agents searching the web, or to bursts of activation spreading across the brain. Qualitative stigmergy, which is the true motor of innovation, can be seen as the basis of symbolic consciousness in the brain. It is exemplified on the web by a variety of collaborative, “open access” sites where people freely improve on each other’s contributions." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

Fortunately, this system is also unnecessary given advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) and the emergence of Web 2.0 features that enhance collective intelligence on the Internet. Several theorists have proposed alternative models of governance that can broadly be categorized as “e-­‐democracies”. These models have been met with incredulity and resistance from policymakers, despite impressive theoretical developments, practical demonstrations, and empirical testing of their ability to maximize the collective intelligence of our societies. Broadly speaking, most “e-­‐ democracy” models are built within a framework of three pillars: (1) distributed decision-­‐making, (2) digitally-­‐based social mediums, and (3) a new paradigm of collaborative democracy. Therefore, the dominant models proposed to replace our current democratic systems can be referred to as a Distributed Digital Democracy (DDD)." - [Distributed Digital Democracy (DDD), by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/distributed-digital-democracy.pdf)

> "Mathematically, one may say that human beings’ value systems are “partial orderings” – they allow a person to say whether X is more valuable than Y, in a certain context. But money requires something stronger than this – it requires the arrangement of all entities to be valued in a “total ordering”, so that any X and Y can be compared as to their relative values. This has the merit of simplicity; it allows values to be arranged along a number line, so that one can assign each entity whose value is of concern a single number representing its value. But it has the shortcoming of not actually agreeing with the way human minds think and feel about values. In a partial ordering, mathematically, two entities X and Y may simply be incommensurable. NRdimensional vectors (for N>1) are like this; it doesn’t always mean something to say that vector X is “greater than” vector Y. In a value system that is a partial but not total ordering, there may be entities X and Y whose values are incommensurable – there is no clear answer regarding whether X is more valuable than Y or vice versa.

> "Why are we willing to work so hard at things we don’t like doing, in order to buy so many things we don’t need?

And part of the answer is social status. Having a lot of money is itself an indicator of high social status; and money can be used to buy other status indicators. A tremendous amount of money is spent on status symbols of one sort or another. Of course, money is not the only status indicator.

This is a fixed-length or iterated sequence of actions that need to be performed on the initial state, until the state they produce satisfies the condition for being a solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The view of problem solving as computation or as heuristic search seems to imply a sequential process, in which the different steps are performed one by one. A first step in our intended generalization towards distributed, parallel processes is the reinterpretation of problem solving as information processing. The initial state or problem statement can be interpreted as a piece of information received by the agent. The solution of the problem is a new piece of information produced by the agent in response to the problem statement. The task of the intelligent agent is then to transform or process the input information (problem, initial state, “question”) via a number of intermediate stages into the output information (solution, goal state, “answer”)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Compared to the sequential models of intelligence, neural networks have two big advantages:
>
> 1) processing happens in a parallel, distributed manner, making it more robust and flexible;
>
> 2) the network does not need an explicit program to know how it should function: it can learn from experience.
>
> The distributed character of neural networks means that its information and “knowledge” are not localized in a single component: they are spread out across all the nodes and links, which together contribute to the final solution. This makes the processing much more robust: individual components may be missing, malfunctioning or contain errors; yet, the disturbances this introduces to the process are drowned out by the contributions from the other components when everything is aggregated. In a sequential process, on the other hand, every step or component through which the process passes constitutes a bottleneck: if that component breaks down, the process may never recover.
>
> The learning happens via a general “reward” or reinforcement mechanism: links that have been successfully used in producing a good solution become stronger; the others become weaker. After many experiences of successful or failed processing, the relative strengths of the different connections will have shifted so that the probability of overall success has become much larger. This intrinsically simple mechanism only works for complex problems because of the distributed character of the processing: if only the process as a whole could be rewarded or punished, this would not produce enough information for it to learn a complex, subtle procedure consisting of many different actions collaborating towards a global solution. Because the process is distributed, its components can learn individually, so that the one can be reinforced at the same time as its neighbor is weakened, thus rebalancing their relative contributions." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The view of intelligence as a capability for problem solving or information processing runs into a fundamental issue: what is a meaningful problem, or meaningful information? Why should an intelligent agent address certain problems or process certain information, and disregard others? In other words, how does an agent decide what to do or pay attention to? In the approach of traditional artificial intelligence (AI), this issue is ignored, as AI programs are conceived essentially as question-answering systems: the user or programmer introduces the question (problem, query, input), and the program responds with an answer (solution, output).
>
> On the other hand, the issue becomes inevitable once you start to design autonomous systems, i.e. systems that should be able to act intelligently in the absence of an instructor telling them what to do. Such a system should at least have a value system, i.e. a set of explicit or implicit criteria that allow it distinguish “good” outcomes from “bad” ones. Given the ability to evaluate or value phenomena, the agent can then itself decide what aspects of its situation are “problematic” and therefore require some solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The difference between positive (growth) and negative (deficiency) values roughly corresponds to the difference between positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions (e.g. fear, anger, or sadness) occur when a need is frustrated or threatened, i.e. when the agent encounters a perturbation that it may not be able to compensate. Positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, curiosity) on the other hand, function to broaden your domain of interest and build up cognitive, material, or social resources. In other words, they motivate you to connect, explore, play, seek challenges, learn, experience, etc. Negative emotions tend to narrowly focus your attention to the problem at hand, so that you can invest all your resources in tackling that problem; positive emotions tend to widen your field of attention so that it becomes open to discovering new opportunities for growth.
>
> A general theory of values should encompass both positive or growth values, and negative or deficiency values. The present paper will not further develop such a theory. Yet, it is worth pointing out that such a theory would be an important contribution to a general model of intelligence and of the global brain, and therefore definitely worth investigating. Some inspiration can be found in the various psychological theories of motivation or needs, which include fundamental needs/values such as security, social affiliation, achievement and knowledge. More generally, from an evolutionary perspective, all values can be derived from the fundamental value of fitness (survival, development, and reproduction), since natural selection has ensured that agents that did not successfully strive for fitness have been eliminated from the scene." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Valence can be understood as the subjective appreciation by an agent of the global utility, well-being or fitness offered by a particular phenomenon or situation. It can be formalized as a scalar variable, which is larger than zero for positive situations, smaller than zero for negative ones, and zero for neutral or indifferent ones." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "A challenge is a situation that carries valence for an agent, so that the agent is inclined to act, in the case of negative valence by suppressing the perceived disturbance(s), in the case of positive valence by exploring or exploiting the perceived opportunity(ies). More concisely, we can define a challenge as a phenomenon that invites action from an agent. Negative challenges correspond to what we have called problems; positive challenges represent affordances for growth or progress. But note that these are not opposites but independent dimensions, since a challenge can carry both positive and negative valences. For example, for a hunter, encounter with a wild boar is both an opportunity, since a wild boar has tasty meat, and a problem, since a wild boar is dangerous. For a company, a free trade agreement can be both positive, since it gives access to new clients, and negative, since it opens the door to new competitors. A challenge incites action because it represents a situation in which not acting will lead to an overall lower fitness than acting—because the agent gains fitness by taking action, loses fitness by not taking action, or both. Thus, a challenge can be seen as a promise of fitness gain for action relative to inaction.
>
> However, a challenge merely inspires or stimulates action, it does not impose it. The reason is that a complex situation will typically present many challenging phenomena, and the agent will not be able to act on all of them. For example, someone surfing the web typically encounters many pages that seem worth investigating, but obviously cannot read all of them. We may assume that an agent is intrinsically capable of choice, and that this choice will be determined partly by subjective preferences, partly by situational influences, partly by chance, i.e. intrinsically unpredictable, “random” fluctuations. Therefore, it is in general impossible to determine exactly how an agent will react to a situation, although it should be possible to derive statistical regularities about the most common choices. The implication for modeling is that an agent should not be represented as a deterministic automaton, but as a stochastic system, which may make different decisions in apparently identical cases, but where it is meaningful to specify conditional probabilities for the different choices, so that in a given condition e.g. 50% of agents can be expected to make choice A, 30% choice B, and 20% choice C.
>
> One of the reasons for this unpredictability is that agents have bounded rationality19: they normally never have all the information or cognitive abilities necessary to evaluate the different challenges. They, therefore have to make “informed guesses” about the best course of action to take. Moreover, assuming that similar agents tend to look for similar resources, it is worth making a choice different from the choice of the others, so as to avoid competition for scarce resources. In addition to positivity and negativity, other dimensions worth considering in order to compare challenges are:
>
> - prospect (in how far can the agent foresee the different aspects or implications of the challenge?),
>
> - difficulty (how much effort would be involved in tackling the challenge?), and
>
> - mystery (in how far would tackling this challenge increase the agent’s prospect concerning other challenges?)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "A difference between simple relaxation models and challenge models is that intelligent agents (as living or artificial systems), unlike physical systems, must remain in a far-from-equilibrium state: they are constantly active, consuming energy, and trying to avoid at all costs a complete standstill (i.e. death). Therefore, while they are inclined to relax existing challenges, they will also seek new challenges (affordances, resources, opportunities), unlike physical systems. In that sense, a “challenge relaxing” dynamics only describes part of their behavior, and must be complemented by a “challenge seeking” dynamics that is better described by some form of active exploration. This is the equivalent of what we have called positive or growth values. It is illustrated in the brain by the fact that thinking never stops: activation does not simply diffuse until it fades away; action potentials are continuously generated by the brain itself, even in the absence of outside stimuli that play the role of challenges needing to be relaxed." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The challenge seeking dynamics can be represented by the fact that the agents are constantly confronted by a variety of new challenges, and that they are motivated to pick out the most challenging one of those as soon as the previous challenge has been relaxed. These challenges have an external origin: they are produced by the agent’s environment (which includes other agents as well as the natural and technological environment). We may assume that this environment is in a constant flux, so that agents are “showered” with challenging phenomena. Each of those is an opportunity to extract valence by acting." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Challenges have been defined as “invitations” to act, which means that the agent is not forced to take up the invitation. This is necessary because in general many challenges vie for an agent’s attention, and not all can be taken up. This becomes particularly clear if we imagine a hunter-gatherer exploring a stretch of rain forest with its thousands of varied stimuli, or a person surfing the web with it millions of potentially interesting pages. The agent’s capabilities for cognitive processing and action are limited, and therefore a selection must be made between these myriads of potentially important challenges. A model of challenge propagation ideally should include a system of selection criteria and mechanisms that help the agent single out the most significant challenges—however, without assuming that there is a single most important one.
>
> Some work that may be of help here is Baars’s model of consciousness, which assumes that within the brain many stimuli and thoughts compete for attention. However, only a single one can be amplified to the degree that it comes to dominate the “global workspace” that interconnects all the more specialized brain regions. From this workspace, the thoughts selected to be most important for conscious attention are “broadcasted” to the whole brain. This model presupposes a positive feedback mechanism where strongly activated thoughts become even stronger, while suppressing weaker ones, until a single “winner” remains. This is an example of the “winner-takes-it-all” dynamic common in non-linear, self- organizing systems. The suppression requires a mechanism of neural inhibition that may use some form of negative activation.
>
> Research on attention and consciousness (see my lecture notes on “Cognitive Systems” for a review) points to unexpectedness and valence as major criteria for winning the competition: stimuli that are surprising, and/or that are highly relevant for the present goal tend to attract most attention. The valence criterion is most obvious, as challenges that promise a higher reward than others deserve more attention." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "We are left with three fundamental criteria for deciding which challenges are most worth attending to: valence, surprise, and clarity. An agent is most likely to act on a challenge that entails high value (large potential gains or losses), that is mysterious, unusual or surprising, and where there is minimal uncertainty or ambiguity about how to act. Note that the surprise/mystery and clarity criteria at first sight may appear to be opposite. However, the uncertainty implied by surprise is one about the nature of the challenge (what is its true valence?), while the certainty implied by clarity is one about the choice of action (how should I deal with this challenge?). These are not contradictory, as an uncertain challenge (e.g. a mysterious envelope left on your doorstep) may well incite a clear action (e.g. open the envelope to see what it contains). It is clear that in such a case the challenge will have a high priority even though its valence is as yet unknown: you are likely to immediately open the envelope, even though you may be disappointed to see that it contains merely some irrelevant publicity. " - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Each agent dealing with a challenge will normally extract some benefit from it, while reducing some components, and leaving some others invariant. If we focus only on the invariant components, we get a model of information transmission similar to the spreading of memes: messages are passed on from agent to agent, without undergoing much change, until they have reached everyone that may be interested in the message. This could for example be a model of the diffusion of a particular innovation, fashion, or scientific theory.
>
> If we focus on the variable components, we get a model of the self-organization of workflow and division of labor: different agents perform different tasks that are part of a common challenge, and then pass on the remaining challenge to others with different skills and/or needs, up to the point where nothing of value is left to extract, i.e. all tasks have been done. To better understand such distributed processing of a challenge we will need to investigate the dynamics of propagation from agent to agent." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "There are two paradigmatic cases of challenge propagation: stigmergy and propagation across a network. In the case of stigmergy, a challenge remains available in a public medium or workspace that all agents can access. If an agent decides to take on the challenge, it will perform some actions that change the state of the challenge and then leaves the modified challenge in the medium. At a later stage, some other agent may pick up the modified challenge, and perform some further work on it, again leaving the “traces” of its work in the medium—where it can function as a challenge for some further agent. Here, the changes in the challenge in a sense propagate in time, but not in space, as they always remain available in the same place. The medium either has a trivial topology (there is only one “place”), or its topology does not directly affect the propagation from agent to agent.
>
> The other paradigmatic case is a social or neural network, in which a challenge moves from agent to agent by following the available links in the network. Here, the topology of the network (which node is connected to which other nodes) fundamentally determines the propagation process: a challenge can move directly from agent A to agent B only if there exists a link A → B in the network. In the stigmergic case, the challenge can move from any agent X to any agent Y, without constraints. The only requirement is that Y should “visit” the shared medium some time after X deposited its modified challenge there. An Internet example of stigmergy is Wikipedia, where any person can modify any page at any stage independently of which other person has contributed to that page. An Internet example of networked propagation is email, where A can pass a challenge on to B only if A has B’s email address, and B has enough trust in A to take on challenges from A—which typically only happens if A and B have a social or organizational connection." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "As a general rule of thumb, the most interesting networks to explore will be those that are most similar in structure to the “natural” networks that we find in social networks, the Internet, or the brain. These all tend to have the following properties:
>
> - recurrent (links are directed but can form loops or cycles)
>
> - small-world (two arbitrary nodes tend to be separated by not more than a small number of links)
>
> - clustering (two neighbors of a node tend to be connected to each other)
>
> - power-law (many nodes with few links, few nodes with many links)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The connection strength of a (multi)link expresses the probability that a challenge will be successfully propagated across that link, i.e. that an agent in the output set would take up the challenge proposed by an agent in the input set. Link strength can be formalized most simply as the conditional probability P(B|A) that agent B would take on a challenge received from agent A.
>
> This probability can depend on different properties of the communicative connection between agents, including: trust (the degree to which the receiving agent takes challenges coming via the link from the sending agent seriously), power (the degree to which the sending agent can compel the sending agent to act), friendship (the degree to which the receiving agent is eager to do something for the sending agent independently of any power relationships), friction (the effort or energy that it costs to transmit the challenge across the link) and bandwidth (the detail and clarity with which information can be transmitted along the link). Link strength therefore may represent any and all of these properties." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Note that the success of the crossing (i.e. whether the receiving agent effectively addresses the challenge) depends first of all on that agent itself, that is, its selection criteria for relevance, and its capabilities for processing the challenge. The link strength merely represents the social-communicative aspect of the process, namely the relationship between sending and receiving agent determining in how far the receiving agent is likely to pay attention to the other’s challenges. If the two agents have a very weak relationship (like in two agents who don’t know each other but who both have read the same Wikipedia page), the probability of one picking up a challenge left by the other is a priori very low, and will be determined almost exclusively by the properties of the challenge and of the agents rather than by their relationship. However, this low probability may be compensated by the fact that the multilink connects a very large number of agents, so that at least one agent in the output set is likely to pick up the challenge." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The intelligence of the network could then be equated with the speed of decrease in the average length for all challenge vectors present in the network: the more quickly the network can “relax” its various challenges, the smarter it is. This now allows us to compare many different variations of the model to see which ones exhibit most intelligence. Some obvious variations to investigate are:
>
> - different criteria used by the agents to select which challenges to address
>
> - different cognitive architectures (e.g. production rules or neural networks) for the agents
>
> - different hypergraph topologies (e.g. stigmergy vs. binary graphs)
>
> - different network topologies (e.g. hierarchical, clustering, power-law, etc.)
>
> - different rules for propagating the challenges across the links
>
> - different learning rules for changing the link weights in the network" - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "While the development of such a model will still require a lot of research, the present analysis makes the problem much more tractable, by subdividing it into separate elements (such as challenge, agent and multilink), structures (such as topology of the network, or organization of the agents), processes (such as challenge selection, challenge processing, and challenge propagation), and measures (such as degree of relaxation, priority of a challenge, and overall intelligence)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Offer networks can also implement a more flexible form of social governance that has been called “libertarian paternalism”, “nudging”, or “mobilization”. The principle here is that there are no absolute obligations or prohibitions: everyone has the freedom to choose from the full range of available options. However, the options are arranged in such a way that the ones that are most beneficial to society (e.g. consuming vegetables, or taking courses) become easiest, most apparent or most attractive to choose, while those that are least beneficial (e.g. consuming tobacco, junk food or fossil fuels) require some special effort or motivation to go beyond the default choice. Socially beneficial “nudging” can be achieved by adding soft constraints that represent externalities, i.e. the costs and benefits to others of a transaction between private parties. These additional constraints would affect the order or priority of the solutions suggested by the offer network. For example, a less polluting option would get a higher priority even though it may fit the request somewhat less accurately. Like all other rules in the network, both legally binding and “nudging” rules should be made public and explicit, so that anyone can scrutinize them, evaluate them, criticize them, and if necessary propose alternatives." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

Second, when a system becomes truly useful, people become increasingly motivated to learn to use it in the most effective way, putting in the necessary time and effort to assimilate all the tips and tricks. Third, such usage eventually becomes part of general education—just like reading and writing evolved from highly technical activities performed by a small elite of experts to general skills expected from everybody. Finally, we already alluded to the virtuous cycle of stigmergy: the partial products (such as an incomplete Wikipedia article) of some, when clearly expressed in a common medium, stimulate and guide others to add their own contributions.

This is where Internet technologies can play a crucial role. They make it in principle possible for any agent (human or artificial) to interact in real-time with any other agent, while keeping a detailed trace of such interactions and their outcomes. This makes it easier to find, select and reinforce the interactions that are most effective in tackling problems, while eliminating the less useful ones.

This creates a sense of achievement, as players can graduate into increasingly advanced “levels” of expertise in the game. While these gaming applications may seem rather frivolous, the underlying psychological mechanism of flow makes a real contribution to people’s level of happiness. Moreover, this mechanism can be extended by techniques such as “gamification” to tasks that are very serious indeed, such as studying mathematics, or increasing fitness.

Unfortunately such a framework is all too often found in fundamentalist ideologies, or in irrational beliefs and superstitions. Science should be our weapon in the fight against irrationality and fundamentalism. Regrettably, contemporary science seems to contribute to the confusion by the avalanche of often-contradictory observations and theories that it overloads us with. That is why we need to develop a coherent, new worldview that is solidly rooted in the most advanced scientific concepts and observations, but that goes beyond the simple-minded determinism and reductionism of Newtonian science in order to bring us back a sense of meaning, of purpose, of being part of a larger whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

In self-organization there is no centralized control, no separable agent that directs the actions of the others.

There are presently so many issues that clamor for our attention that we often do not know anymore what to focus on, but instead jump from the one thing to the next without giving anything the attention it deserves, or simply procrastinate and wait for things to be imposed from the outside.

This is the basic “research support” module, which helps individual researchers to discover and resolve the remaining gaps in their understanding.
>
> - A discussion module that would support reaching consensus about as yet unresolved issues, not only via traditional free-form “forums”, but via structured networks of arguments and counterarguments. Here, the systems’ analysis of the network would help the users to identify the weakest arguments, thus stimulating their authors to either change their position, or propose better arguments to defend it. This module further supports research, but now at the level of the dialogue between researchers who have different perspectives on the issue.
>
> - An educational subnetwork of “guided tours” or paths within the conceptual network, functioning as suggested sequences for learners to study the knowledge that start from easier concepts and build up towards more advanced ones depending on the interests of the learner. This would help a student to quickly advance into a complex knowledge domain without getting confused by the variety and complexity of the knowledge that is available. To make this most effective, the guidance should be adapted individually to the interests and skills of each student. This can be achieved with the following assessment module. Moreover, the system would learn from the way it is being used, so that later students would get recommendations that take into account the experiences of previous students.
>
> - A system that generates questions about the knowledge in the network. Most of these questions should be easy to answer by someone who knows the domain, and thus could be used to test the knowledge of the users. This is the module for teaching and assessment on the basis of “inverted learning”. The procedure starts by asking the users a question in order to stimulate or challenge them to reflect about the domain. It then gives them the right answer on the basis of what is contained in the knowledge base (feedback). Depending on how well a user scores on different parts of the curriculum, the system would recommend a further study of particular parts of the knowledge network, thus acting as a kind of tutor to a student. When a question does not have a satisfactory answer within the knowledge base or the user disagrees with the answer that is offered, the user will be stimulated to mark out and—ideally— resolve this knowledge gap. This connects the teaching and assessment module to the research module: depending on how easy or ambiguous the question is, answering it can be more a questions of assessment of existing knowledge or of stimulating the creation of new knowledge.
>
> Like Wikipedia, such a knowledge network should be able to grow indefinitely, so as to encompass all the relevant knowledge about a particular domain. Moreover, the system would automate the social and organizational functions of a university by stimulating users to develop their knowledge, assessing their progress, giving them feedback about how well they are doing, proposing concrete goals for their next study or research, and thus mobilizing and coordinating their cognitive efforts as efficiently as possible towards an ever increasing understanding of the domain. If such a system were deployed at a global level, like Wikipedia, it would provide an invaluable aid to the cognitive development of the world population." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Regulation (or control): the process by which an agent continually neutralizes deviations from its goals, by effectively counteracting disturbances. Regulation implements negative feedback: deviations in one direction are compensated by reactions that push the state in the opposite direction, so as to reduce their effect. The classic example of regulation is the functioning of a thermostat, which switches on the heating as soon as the temperature moves below its set temperature or goal, and switches off the heating as soon as the temperature moves above the goal temperature." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Navigation: the process by which an agent constantly adjusts its course of action so as to dynamically maximize its advance in utility while taking into account the diversions it encounter. This means that the agent should optimally allocate its effort in simultaneously counteracting disturbances (regulation), finding affordances (exploration), and making use of the affordances it has found (exploitation). Navigating means that the agent needs to set out a well-thought out, but flexible course, using a combination of planning (to deal with known disturbances and affordances) and improvisation (to deal with new diversions)." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Variety of action: the number of actions that an agent can potentially execute. The larger an agent’s variety of action, the larger the variety of diversions that the agent can deal with, because different types of diversions typically require different types of actions. This is a generalization of Ashby’s well-known “law of requisite variety”. However, while increasing the variety of actions makes the agent potentially more powerful in achieving its goals, it also makes it more difficult for the agent to select the most appropriate action." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Cognition: the acquisition, processing, storage, and use of information and knowledge to support intelligent decision-making.

> "Rationality: the hypothetical desire and ability of an agent to always choose the best action. In reality, rationality is restricted or bounded, as an agent never has enough information, knowledge or intelligence to accurately determine the utility of all possible courses of action. Bounded rationality implies that there is always an element of uncertainty or trial-and-error involved in making decisions; no decision can be a priori proven to be the best one." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Collective intelligence: the degree to which the agents in a system collectively can make good decisions as to their future course of action; in particular, the degree to which the agents collectively can make better decisions than any of them individually. Collective intelligence typically arises from the pooling of knowledge: since each agent’s knowledge is slightly different from the knowledge of the others, all agents together will have access to a larger pool of more diverse knowledge. Therefore, collective intelligence can be amplified by increasing the diversity of knowledge among the agents." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Distributed cognition: the acquisition, storage and use of information and knowledge distributed over different agents in a system, so as to support their collective intelligence. This requires mechanisms to communicate information across the different agents in a coordinated manner, so that the right information is gathered at the right place at the right time. Examples of such supporting mechanisms for the exchange of information are pheromones (smell signals), language, books, signs, computers and the Internet." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Coordination: the arrangement or mutual alignment of actions so as to maximize synergy and minimize friction in their overall pattern of activity. It implies that any two actions performed simultaneously or subsequently are selected so as to maximally complement and minimally obstruct each other. This requires a minimization of the uncertainty that otherwise would dissipate resources in needless trial-and-error, and therefore the imposition of appropriate constraints or bonds that drive the action in the right direction. There are two types of basic relational constraints between actions: parallel, specifying which actions could or should go on simultaneously, and sequential, specifying which action could or should follow which other action." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Self-organization: the spontaneous emergence or evolution of coordination in a complex adaptive system. Self-organization reduces variety or uncertainty, and thus imposes constraint. The driving force behind self-organization is the co-evolution or mutual adaptation between the different agents in the system: actions and reactions produce a continuously changing configuration of interactions (variation); however, the more synergetic a configuration, the more "satisfied" the agents will be with the situation, and thus the less they will act to produce further changes (selective retention or preference for synergetic configurations); vice versa, the more friction there is, the more the agents will be pressured to intervene and change course in order to increase their utility (elimination of high friction configurations). Thus, self-organization is merely an application of the evolutionary dynamic of variation (because of actions triggering further actions) and natural selection (because of the implicit preference of agents for the more synergetic patterns of action)." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Organization: a stabilized network of interactions between agents that functions to ensure the coordination of their actions. This structure specifies the specific roles of and interactions between the system's agents. Its function is to maximize synergy and minimize friction (including transaction costs) in their further interactions. For example, in a human organization the different individuals each have their own responsibilities, and the rules of the organization specify who interacts with whom in what way. This minimizes transaction costs, since it is no longer necessary to search for partners, negotiate with them, or strictly monitor whether they do what they are expected to do. An organization can be imposed from the outside (like in a system engineered by a designer or controlled by a manager), or emerge from self-organization." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Stigmergy: a form of indirect coordination via the medium, where the trace left by an action in the medium stimulates the performance of a subsequent action, thus building further on the work that has already been done. Examples of stigmergic interaction are termites collectively building a termite hill by adding mud to heaps left by other termites, ants mapping out their territory by leaving trails of pheromone that lead other ants to food sources, and people adding their insights to the writings of others, thus collaboratively developing an encyclopedia (Wikipedia) on the web. Stigmergy is typically the result of the self-organization of a mediator out of the medium. It is probably the simplest way to achieve coordination in a complex system because it does not make any cognitive demands on the agents (such as remembering who is to do what when), and therefore functions even with agents of very low intelligence, such as insects. It also does not require any relationship, communication or even direct interaction between the agents: contributors to a Wikipedia page typically have no idea who the other contributors are, yet their contributions are seamlessly integrated into the emerging whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Evolution of cooperation: the general tendency for interactions to become more synergetic through variation and selection, thus reducing competition and conflict. The biggest obstacle to the evolution of cooperation is the problem of “free riders”: agents that profit from the collaborative effort of other agents but without contributing themselves. Since free riders typically extract more benefit from the cooperation than the cooperators themselves, they risk outcompeting the cooperators, thus destroying any tendency to cooperation. This problem can be overcome via the evolution of a mediator that makes free riding impossible, or at least less attractive than true cooperation." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "According to some estimates, in our present economic system more than half of economic value generated is lost to transaction costs. A fundamental source of transaction costs is uncertainty: since the agent does not know what transaction to enter into, what to agree upon, or what to expect, it will need to spend a lot of energy in search, negotiation, and enforcement of agreements." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "The potential for theoretical explanation and practical application of the stigmergy concept is much larger still than hitherto assumed. What (Parunak, 2006) noted about human institutions, that the more difficult issue is to find examples where stigmergy does not apply, extends to complex systems in general, and in particular to systems that exhibit some form of cognition, cooperation, or organization that is the result of evolution. When properly defined, the mechanism of stigmergy appears to be nearly ubiquitous, and able to illuminate a variety of conceptual problems in a non-trivial manner." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Compared to traditional methods of organization, stigmergy makes absolutely minimal demands on the agents. In particular, in stigmergic collaboration there is no need for:
>
> • planning or anticipation: agents only need to know the present state of the activity; the overall goal, next step or end result is irrelevant for their present work. In Wikipedia, there is no plan specifying which information should be added to the encyclopedia when.
>
> • memory: agents do not need to remember their previous activity; no information about the state of the work needs to be stored anywhere except in the medium.
>
> • communication: no information needs to be transferred between the agents, except via the work done in the medium; there is in particular no need for the agents to negotiate about who does what.
>
> • mutual awareness: each agent works independently; it does not even need to know that others participate. For example, contributors to Wikipedia generally do not know each other or communicate with each other.
>
> • simultaneous presence: there is in general no need for the agents to be present at the same time or at the same place; tasks are registered in the medium so that they can be picked up by agents whenever and wherever they are available. That is how worldwide communities can collaborate on a single software project.
>
> • imposed sequence: actions are performed automatically in the right order, since an action will not be started until the right condition is in place; the workflow emerges spontaneously, as the completion of one task triggers the initiation of the next task(s)
>
> • imposed division of labor: each agent will only perform the actions for which it has the required competence, i.e. for which it possesses adequate condition-action rules; normally, the more “confident” the agent is about the right action (i.e. the stronger the connection between condition and action), the more it will be stimulated by the condition, and the quicker it will be to start the job; in this way, tasks are automatically assigned to the most competent agents
>
> • commitment: agents do no need to commit to a particular task (in contradiction to what (Jennings, 1993) claims about multi-agent coordination); an agent decides on the spot what work it should do, depending on opportunity and other contingent conditions; an agent that quits or otherwise becomes unavailable is automatically replaced by another one
>
> • centralized control or supervision: errors or perturbations are automatically corrected, as they merely create a new condition stimulating new actions to deal with the challenge; the activity is self-organizing: global organization emerges from local interactions, without any centralized control directing the activity.

> "Stigmergy exhibits another fundamental “signature” of self-organization: positive feedback. Error-controlled regulation assumes negative feedback: the reduction of deviations away from the goal. However, goal-directed action can also make use of positive feedback: the amplification of movements towards the goal." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The number of agents collaborating on a stigmergic project is actually much less fundamental than it may seem. The essence of the activity is always the same. Assuming that the agents have the same competencies, adding more agents merely increases manpower and therefore the size of the problem that can be tackled, the speed of advance, or the eventual magnitude of the achievement. Only when the agents are diverse can an increase in their number produce a qualitative improvement in the solution.
>
> The only complication added is that agents may get in each other's way, in the sense that similar individuals perceiving the same stimulus are likely to move to the same place at the same time, thus obstructing each other's actions. This problem is easily tackled by an additional rule, which is already implicit in individual work but likely to become reinforced during collaborative work: keep a minimum distance from obstacles— including other agents. This rule is a well-known ingredient in the many successful simulations of collectively moving animals, such as flocks, schools or swarms, allowing densely packed groups of agents to follow complex, synchronized trajectories without ever bumping into each other." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Quantitative vs. qualitative stigmergy:
>
> Quantitative stigmergy refers to perceived conditions that differ in strength or degree, and where stronger traces typically elicit more forceful (intense, frequent, …) actions. This quantitative variation is perhaps best captured using my definition of stimulation in terms of conditional probability: the stronger the trace, the larger the probability of a certain action given that trace. Over an extended period, higher probability implies more frequent actions by more numerous agents, and therefore more intense overall activity. The two paradigmatic cases of stigmergy, termite nest-building and ant trail-laying, follow this quantitative logic. The higher the emerging heap of mud (stronger trace), the more an individual termite is attracted to it, and therefore the larger the probability or frequency of mud being added. The stronger the scent of pheromone on a trail, the less likely an ant is to deviate from that trail, and therefore the higher the probability that it too will reinforce the trail with additional pheromone. These are typical examples of the positive feedback that efficiently amplifies positive developments.
>
> But quantitative stigmergy can also be exemplified by negative feedback, where a stronger trace leads to less activity. A human example can be found in the market mechanism. Extensive buying of a good (action) reduces the supply and thus increases the price, which is a quantitative trace left by the collective buying and selling activity. A higher price will normally reduce the probability that someone would buy additional stock of that good (negative stimulation). Thus, a higher price reduces demand, which in turn will reduce the price. This mechanism of self-organizing, distributed control implements the “invisible hand” of the market. It stabilizes prices and efficiently allocates production capacity to the goods that are most in demand.
>
> Qualitative stigmergy refers to conditions and actions that differ in kind rather than in degree. In this case, a different trace stimulates a different type of action. An example can be found in the different stages of the building of a funnel-shaped nest by the solitary wasp that we discussed, where each stage requires a particular type of building action. A human example can be found in “wiki” websites that are edited by their own readers. A paragraph that contains a semantic mistake (e.g. in the definition of a word) will elicit a corrective action (e.g. writing a new definition). Different types of errors, vagueness, or lack of information will stimulate different types of additions and corrections." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "This type of indirect stimulation, not by the work itself but by a specially evolved “side-effect”, has been called marker-based stigmergy. The evolution of markers is an obvious method to make stigmergy more efficient, by more reliably focusing the agents' attention on the most relevant aspects of the work that needs to be done. However, it entails an extra cost and complication in that individuals need to perform the task of manufacturing markers in addition to the work itself. A human example can be found in the Wikipedia encyclopedia on the web. Readers are stimulated to improve existing pages either directly, by reading the text and noticing its shortcomings, or indirectly, by reading comments that summarize the tasks that still need to be done—such as adding references, clarifying ambiguous sections, or checking facts. The direct method exemplifies sematectonic stigmergy, the indirect one marker-based stigmergy. The “markers” in this case are the various “to do” notes that attract the attention to the problems that still require work. A marker can be seen as an abstract, conventional sign, intentionally representing the work to be done instead of mechanically registering its effects. In Peirce's semiotic taxonomy of signs, a marker is a symbol, while a sematectonic trace is an index. As such, a marker may seem to belong to a higher-order semiotic or communicative category of phenomena—a “meta-level” compared to the “object level” of the work itself. However, as in all phenomena produced by evolution, there is an essential continuity between the more primitive and the more “advanced” versions." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "This is the same phenomenon of selective “forgetting” that characterizes memory in the brain: neural connections that are no longer reinforced will gradually lose their strength relative to recently reinforced ones. The speed of this forgetting depends on the learning parameter, as defined in neural networks. A large value of the parameter means that new changes in connection strength are large relative to the cumulative effect of previous ones, thus promoting the speedy establishment of new memory traces—but also the quick obsolescence of older traces. A small value, on the other hand, means that older learning episodes continue to exert a strong effect. A similar parameter probably controls the external memory of ants as laid down in pheromone trails: newly added pheromone should be strong enough to allow trails towards newly found food sources to eventually become more attractive than previously found ones; yet, it should not be so strong that some recent journeys by ants carrying food from a new, unproven source can overpower the signals pointing to an older source whose reliability is evidenced by hundreds of successful journeys. Given that what counts is the relative attractiveness of different options for action, the “learning” parameter, which determines the intensity of new contributions to the trace, is in practice equivalent to a “forgetting” parameter, which determines the rate of decay of the existing trace. The optimal value of this parameter will depend on the speed with which information becomes obsolete." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "No sharp distinction can be made between persistent and transient traces used in stigmergy: these are merely the opposite ends of a continuum. Yet, the distinction may be useful for conceptual clarification. Persistent traces lead to what may be called asynchronous stigmergy: the different agents or productions do not need to be present at the same time, since the trace remains to guide them at any later time. Asynchronous communication can be illustrated by media such as print, email, or websites. Its advantage is that information remains available, so that it can be processed at the most appropriate occasion, and can accumulate and mature over the longer term. Transient traces lead to synchronous stigmergy: the agents need to be simultaneously present for the coordination to succeed.
>
> Synchronous communication may be exemplified by media such as telephone and Internet “chat”. Its advantage is that interaction, and therefore feedback, is instantaneous, so that disturbances and coordination errors can be corrected without delay. Synchronous communication is rarely conceived as stigmergic, since it is typically used for direct interaction, such as conversation or discussion. Yet, a warning cry or a chemical signal exemplify indirect interaction: they are targeted at no one in particular but merely “released” in the medium. Examples of stigmergy in synchronous interaction are even clearer when the signal is sematectonic. For example, a bird spotting a danger (condition) will start to fly (action), and by this example (transient trace) set off the whole flock to fly away (subsequent action). Synchronous stigmergy may be best exemplified by the collective movement in herds, flocks or swarms, where the agents are continually adjusting their trajectory on the basis of real-time perceptions of the movements of other agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "A one-dimensional, quantitative aspect: the range or scope of the stigmergic process. The scope represents the size of the “neighborhood” across which a stigmergic signal is perceivable. The two poles of the scope continuum may be called broadcast and narrowcast. Broadcasted traces can be perceived by all agents involved. Narrowcasted traces are perceivable by only one or a few agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The situation becomes more complex—but also more interesting—when different actions or agents have a different scope, so that A's traces e.g. may reach B, C and D, while D's traces reach B and E. In this case, the topology of the stigmergic medium becomes equivalent to a network where different nodes (A, B, C…) each are connected to (i.e. can deposit traces perceivable by) different other nodes. The implication is that the network paradigm—which is increasingly popular for modeling various complex and self-organizing systems such as neural networks, social networks, citation networks, etc.—could be viewed as a special case of the stigmergic paradigm, albeit a rather complicated one." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Next to its general function of coordination, stigmergy in particular supports cognition and cooperation. Traditionally, cognition has been viewed as the processing of information inside the brain. More recent approaches, however, note that both the information and the processing often reside in the outside world—or what we have called the medium. For example, documents function as an external memory for storing knowledge and data, while calculations are typically performed on a piece of paper or on a calculator. Without such supporting media, most advanced reasoning—as performed e.g. in science and technology—would be simply impossible. Thus, the human mind extends into the environment, “outsourcing” some of its functions to external support systems. The reason is that our memory and information processing capabilities have rather strict limitations—most famously the “magical number 7 plus or minus 2” which denotes the maximum number of items we can hold in short-term memory. Books and computers are relatively recent inventions. However, the use of an external medium for supporting cognition is probably as old as cognition itself. More precisely, our mental capabilities can be seen as an interiorization of what were initially stigmergic interactions with the environment." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "In the stigmergic paradigm, the common good (e.g. Wikipedia, or a network of trails and roads connecting common destinations) is gradually built up via the cooperation implicit in stigmergically coordinated actions. Free riders may profit from this common good without putting in any effort in return. However, the benefit derived from a stigmergic trace does not in general reduce the value of that trace. For example, an ant that follows a pheromone trace laid by others without adding pheromone of its own does not by that action make the pheromone trace less useful to the other ants. Similarly, a person who downloads a piece of open source software without contributing to the development of that software does not impose any burden on the software developers. Thus, in a situation of stigmergy, a free rider or “defector” does not weaken the cooperators, in contrast to situations like the Prisoners’ dilemma or Tragedy of the Commons.
>
> In a sense, by not contributing the free riding agent merely weakens its own position, because it passes by the opportunity to adapt the trace to its own preferences. As we saw, the stigmergic trace is the aggregate of many independent actions, each of which helps the agent that performed it to achieve its goals. The ant that finds food but does not leave a pheromone trace on its way back to the nest not only does not help others to get to that food: it also does not help itself, because without the trace it is very unlikely to find the same food source again. The trace is both an individual and a collective “mental map” that indicates effective actions. Not leaving a trace makes your own future work harder than it needs to be." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "In the short run, the free rider may seem to have the benefit over the cooperator of spending less energy establishing and maintaining the trace. However, the cooperator collects other benefits. First, as we noted with the ant leaving pheromone or the hiker breaking off branches, the cooperating agent helps itself by creating a trace. Second, the stigmergic interaction will boost the benefits of that individual trace by stimulating others to expand on it. For example, an ant creating a trail to a new food source will incite others to explore the neighborhood of that source, potentially discovering even better sources or shorter trails. Similarly, the hiker who partially cleared a path will thus increase the probability of others following that same path while performing further clearing themselves. This is the positive feedback of actions eliciting more actions that makes stigmergy so effective. The free rider simply misses out on this potential amplification of its actions." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Virtually all evolved processes that require coordination between actions rely at some level on stigmergy, in the sense that subsequent actions are stimulated by the trace left by previous actions in some observable and manipulable medium. The trace functions like a registry and map, indicating which actions have been performed and which still need to be performed. It is shared by all agents that have access to the medium, thus allowing them to coordinate their actions without need for agent-to-agent communication. It also allows individual agents to perform complex sequences of actions without need for a memory or plan that keeps track of which action needs to be performed when...
>
> Stigmergy can be seen as a fundamental mechanism of self-organization: it allows global, coordinated activity to emerge out of local, independent actions. Like self- organization in general, stigmergy relies on feedback: action elicits action, via the intermediary of the trace. This feedback is typically positive, in that actions intensify and elaborate the trace, thus eliciting more intense and diverse further actions. The resulting virtuous cycle explains in part why stigmergic organization is so surprisingly effective, enabling the construction of complex structures—such as a termite hill, a network of trails, or a world encyclopedia—in a very short time, even when starting from scratch. When necessary, feedback can also be negative: errors, disturbances or “overshoots” that make the trace deviate from its ideal shape will elicit actions that correct the deviation.
>
> We have examined different variations on this theme by distinguishing basic aspects or dimensions in which the process can vary. The number of agents involved turns out to be less fundamental than is generally assumed. Increasing that number will qualitatively enhance the result only if the agents are sufficiently diverse in the actions they contribute, yet sufficiently aligned in their strategies so that they do not hinder each other. Like the number of agents, the difference between qualitative and quantitative stigmergy does not seem essential, given that the notion of “stimulation” entails a quantitative aspect of intensity or probability, while the actions that are stimulated more or less intensively differ qualitatively. The difference between sematectonic traces—the concrete, observable results of work performed—and markers—traces left to guide subsequent actions, but without contributing to the work itself—is important but subtle. The use of markers allows a more fine-grained control of stigmergic coordination, but demands an advanced level of collective evolution, in which certain traces have acquired a conventional meaning among the agents that use them. The transience of the trace is crucial in order to ensure that the list of “to do’s” remains up to date: in a quickly changing environment, actions need to adapt in time to new circumstances, which means that an outdated trace should decay before it would elicit too much useless activity; in a more stable environment, on the other hand, persistent traces enable the accumulation of a long and detailed memory. A final dimension of variation, the broadcast-narrowcast continuum, is as yet insufficiently investigated. Nevertheless, it hints at an essential continuity between stigmergic mechanisms of self-organization (using a typically broadcasted trace) and the better-known, local interaction mechanisms, where the result of an action only affects linked or neighboring agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

Only 9% of Americans like it, suggesting a [lower approval rating than](http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html) cockroaches, head lice, or traffic jams. However, [62% of people](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162362/americans-down-congress-own-representative.aspx) who know who their own Congressional representative is approve of them. In theory, it should be really hard to have a democratically elected body that maintains a 9% approval rating for more than one election cycle. In practice, every representative’s incentive is to appeal to his or her constituency while throwing the rest of the country under the bus – something at which they apparently succeed. From a god’s-eye-view, every Congressperson ought to think only of the good of the nation.

> "A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse." - [Meditations on Moloch, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)

> "Like all good mystical experiences, it happened in Vegas. I was standing on top of one of their many tall buildings, looking down at the city below, all lit up in the dark. If you’ve never been to Vegas, it is really impressive. Skyscrapers and lights in every variety strange and beautiful all clustered together. And I had two thoughts, crystal clear:
>
> - It is glorious that we can create something like this.
>
> - It is shameful that we did.
>
> Like, by what standard is building gigantic forty-story-high indoor replicas of Venice, Paris, Rome, Egypt, and Camelot side-by-side, filled with albino tigers, in the middle of the most inhospitable desert in North America, a remotely sane use of our civilization’s limited resources?
>
> And it occurred to me that maybe there is no philosophy on Earth that would endorse the existence of Las Vegas. Even Objectivism, which is usually my go-to philosophy for justifying the excesses of capitalism, at least grounds it in the belief that capitalism improves people’s lives. Henry Ford was virtuous because he allowed lots of otherwise car-less people to obtain cars and so made them better off. What does Vegas do? Promise a bunch of shmucks free money and not give it to them.
>
> Las Vegas doesn’t exist because of some decision to hedonically optimize civilization, it exists because of a quirk in dopaminergic reward circuits, plus the microstructure of an uneven regulatory environment, plus Schelling points. A rational central planner with a god’s-eye-view, contemplating these facts, might have thought “Hm, dopaminergic reward circuits have a quirk where certain tasks with slightly negative risk-benefit ratios get an emotional valence associated with slightly positive risk-benefit ratios, let’s see if we can educate people to beware of that.” People within the system, following the incentives created by these facts, think: “Let’s build a forty-story-high indoor replica of ancient Rome full of albino tigers in the middle of the desert, and so become slightly richer than people who didn’t!”
>
> Just as the course of a river is latent in a terrain even before the first rain falls on it – so the existence of Caesar’s Palace was latent in neurobiology, economics, and regulatory regimes even before it existed. The entrepreneur who built it was just filling in the ghostly lines with real concrete.
>
> So we have all this amazing technological and cognitive energy, the brilliance of the human species, wasted on reciting the lines written by poorly evolved cellular receptors and blind economics, like gods being ordered around by a moron.

> "I know that “capitalists sometimes do bad things” isn’t exactly an original talking point. But I do want to stress how it’s not equivalent to “capitalists are greedy”. I mean, sometimes they are greedy. But other times they’re just in a sufficiently intense competition where anyone who doesn’t do it will be outcompeted and replaced by people who do. Business practices are set by Moloch, no one else has any choice in the matter...
>
> And as well understood as the capitalist example is, I think it is less well appreciated that democracy has the same problems. Yes, in theory it’s optimizing for voter happiness which correlates with good policymaking. But as soon as there’s the slightest disconnect between good policymaking and electability, good policymaking has to get thrown under the bus...
>
> Turning “satisfying customers” and “satisfying citizens” into the outputs of optimization processes was one of civilization’s greatest advances and the reason why capitalist democracies have so outperformed other systems.

> "The two active ingredients of government are laws plus violence – or more abstractly agreements plus enforcement mechanism. Many other things besides governments share these two active ingredients and so are able to act as coordination mechanisms to avoid traps...
>
> Social codes, gentlemens’ agreements, industrial guilds, criminal organizations, traditions, friendships, schools, corporations, and religions are all coordinating institutions that keep us out of traps by changing our incentives.
>
> But these institutions not only incentivize others, but are incentivized themselves. These are large organizations made of lots of people who are competing for jobs, status, prestige, et cetera – there’s no reason they should be immune to the same multipolar traps as everyone else, and indeed they aren’t. Governments can in theory keep corporations, citizens, et cetera out of certain traps, but as we saw above there are many traps that governments themselves can fall into...

> The libertarian-authoritarian axis on the Political Compass is a tradeoff between discoordination and tyranny. You can have everything perfectly coordinated by someone with a god’s-eye-view – but then you risk Stalin.

> "One is redundancy: in all of these sites, many of the ideas represent minor variations of each other. When there are thousands of posts submitted, manually pruning this list to consolidate equivalent posts is a massive undertaking. In Google’s case, for example, the company had to recruit 3,000 employees to filter and consolidate the 150,000 ideas they received in a process that put them 9 months behind their original schedule. Another issue is non- collaborativeness. Idea-sharing sites tend to elicit many fairly simple ideas. The ideas generated by the google project, for example, (e.g. make government more transparent, help social entrepreneurs, support public transport, create user-generated news services) were in large part not novel and light on detail. Surely that massive amount of effort could have been used to compose a smaller number of more deeply-considered ideas, but idea-sharing sites provide little support (or incentive) for this, because people can not collaboratively refine submitted ideas." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> The simple argument map scheme we use represents a tradeoff between expressiveness and ease-of-use. It does not formally capture, for example, such concepts as:
>
> • Inter-dependencies: often the solution to a complex problem consists of a package of component solutions that have to fit together well for the complete solution to be a good one. This could be handled, for example, by having ideas that consist of packages of other ideas, along with “fits with” links between these component ideas to which we can attach pro and con arguments.
>
> • Relative valuations: often people wish to discuss the relative, rather than the absolute merits of ideas (e.g. “carbon tax is better than cap-and-trade because …”). This could be handled by having “better than” links between ideas that can in turn be linked to pro and con arguments.
>
> • Warrants vs antecedents: the current formalism doesn’t allow one to deliberate separately about the antecedents and warrant for an argument. If someone claims, for example, that “global warming is bunk because the weather was cold today”, you can’t argue for or against the warrant (i.e. “a cold day debunks global warming”) separately from the antecedent (“today was a cold day”). This could be handled by allowing one to attach arguments to the links between other arguments, or (equivalently) by being able to specify when the children of an argument have a conjunctive semantics as opposed to the default disjunctive semantics.
>
> We have experimented with extending our formalism to cover these cases, but our experience to date has been that every additional bit of formal complexity seems to substantially increase the possibility for user confusion, and therefore represents a potential barrier to widespread participation. We are thus taking a very incremental approach to adding new formal structures, and are studying how to do so in a way that works both for novice and more expert users." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "A set of community conventions (similar to those that underlie other social computing systems like Wikipedia and Slashdot) help ensure that the argument map is well-organized. Each post should represent a single issue, idea, pro, or con, should not replicate a point that has been made elsewhere in the argument map, and should be attached to the post it logically refers to. A central tenet is the “live and let live” rule: if one disagrees with an idea or argument, the user should not change that post to undermine it, but should rather create new posts that present their alternative ideas or counter-arguments. Every individual can thus present their own point of view, using the strongest arguments they can muster, without fear of sabotage by anyone else. This process is supported by capabilities that have proven invaluable in other social computing systems, including rating (to help the community encourage and identify important issues, ideas and arguments), watchlists (which automatically notify users of changes to posts they have registered interest in), version histories (to allow users to roll-back an post to a previous version if it has been “damaged” by an edit), and home pages (which allows users to develop an online presence). The system also provides multiple forms of social translucence (i.e. visual cues concerning who is doing what in the system), thereby fostering a sense of belonging as well as enabling self-organized attention mediation by the community...
>
> Because good argument-mapping skills are not universal, moderators help ensure that new posts are correctly structured. Their job is part education, and part quality control. Posts, when initially created, are given a “pending” status and can only be viewed by other authors. If a post doesn’t adequately follow the argument map conventions, moderators will either fix it or leave comments explaining what needs to be done. Once a moderator has verified that a post follows the conventions, the post is “certified” and becomes available to be viewed, edited, commented on, or rated by the general user population. The certification process helps ensures well- structured maps, and provides incentives for users to learn the argument formalism. Moderators serve a relatively modest role in all this: their role is not to evaluate the merits of a post, but simply to work with authors to ensure that the content is structured in a way that maximizes its utility to the community at large.
>
> We estimate, based on our experience to date, that there needs to be about 1 moderator for every 20 active authors, to ensure that posts are checked and certified in a timely fashion without undue burden on each moderator. This figure is well within the bounds of the percentage of “power users” that are a common feature of social computing systems. Experienced authors, with a track record of successful argument map creation, can be selected to join the moderator pool. There is already, in addition, a substantial world-wide community of people with argument mapping skills. One organization alone (cognexus.org) has trained and certified hundreds of people on argument mapping techniques. Argument mapping is, in addition, a natural skill for lawyers, philosophers, mathematicians, library scientists, debaters, and others who frequently create taxonomies, arguments or proofs. Such individuals may be inspired by the opportunity to contribute their skills to deliberations about complex critical challenges, even if they do not have substantial content expertise in that area.
>
> While this has not happened in our evaluations to date, it is of course possible that moderators may undercut the deliberations by imposing their own biases when deciding which posts to certify. There are many ways to address this concern. For example, moderators can double-check each others’ decisions, especially when authors complain that a post of theirs was inappropriately left uncertified. We can also provide a moderator rating system so that the user community can identify consistently poor moderators, plus a voting process for deciding when to remove moderator privileges from such individuals. Such a “meta-moderation” model has worked successfully with such systems as Wikipedia and Slashdot.
>
> Another potential problem is that the community’s understanding of a topic may shift, so that the initial formulation of the deliberation (as captured by the set of key issues being discussed) may need to change after considerable effort has been invested deliberating about the old set of issues. At worse, all affected posts might have to be de-certified and go through a new certification process to make sure they get fit properly into the new structure. This has also not happened in our evaluations to date – the core questions have been clear-cut from the start - but it does suggest that the participants in a deliberation should frame the “skeleton” of initial issues carefully so this problem can be avoided as much as possible." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "It has been found that users are motivated by two key benefits when contributing to social computing systems: (1) finding their tribe (i.e. getting connected with people who share their interests) and (2) becoming a hero (having a substantive positive impact on a community they care about)...
>
> The larger the user community, therefore, the more potential redundancy there is, and thus the more value argument mapping offers in terms of improving the signal to noise ratio. There is widespread disaffection with the low signal-to-noise ratio of current social media tools. We can thus expect that, as the scale of the discussion grows, users will increasingly recognize the opportunity to “become a hero” by contributing something (i.e. creating a value-rich deliberation map) that is highly valued by the community. Argument mapping also increases user’s chances of “finding their tribe”. While contributing to unstructured discussions is easier, the high volume and redundancy of such discussions means that most posts will probably be overlooked by most readers. In an argument map, by contrast, if you have a unique point to make, it has a muchgreater chance of being seen. We can thus expect the benefits of argument mapping, to a contributor, will increase rapidly with the size of the user community.
>
> We can also expect, moreover, that the costs of participation for a contributor will grow only slowly as the community scales. Contributing to a deliberation map incurs two main costs:
>
> 1) unbundling the contribution into its constituent issues, ideas, and arguments
>
> 2) locating the proper place to place these elements in the map
>
> The cost of unbundling a contribution is independent, of course, of the size of the map. The cost of locating a contribution should increase with the size of the map, but only slowly. Remember that a deliberation map is structured like a tree. To find the right place to put a post in a tree, you just have to pick the right top-level branch to place it, the right sub-branch under that, and so on, until you reach the place where it belongs. If the average branching factor (number of sub-branches per branch) of a tree is N, then the average number of steps needed to locate a post is no more than the Nth logarithm of the tree size...
>
> The benefits of adding to an argument map grow rapidly as the community scales, in proportion to how much the signal-to-noise ratio is improved, roughly exponentially, The costs of adding toan argument map grow only logarithmically with scale. At some point, we can expect, the benefits to individual authors will greatly exceed the costs, thereby providing compelling incentives for participation.
>
> Technological and process refinements can further improve this picture by reducing authoring and moderation costs. One option, for example, is “wisdom of the crowds” moderation, wherein the full user community, performing simplified moderation “micro-tasks”, substitutes for a relatively small cadre of expert moderators. There is good reason to believe that such an approach can work. It has been shown many times that large numbers of people with even modest skills can, in the aggregate, perform judgment tasks better than experts. It has also been shown, by such systems as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, that large number of people are willing to perform such micro-tasks cheaply, or even for free if they believe in the project.
>
> While these results are promising, our work has led us to conclude that, to fully realize argumentation technology’s potential for supporting large-scale deliberations, we need to address the critical challenge of attention allocation. For the kinds of topics that most require large-scale deliberation, even a user community of moderate size can quickly generate large and rapidly growing argument maps. How can we help users identify the portions of the map that can best benefit from their contributions, in maps with hundreds or thousands of posts? How can the stakeholders assess whether the deliberations are progressing well, whether some intervention is needed to help the deliberations work more effectively, and when the results are mature and ready to “harvest”? Can we foster, for large-scale deliberations, the understanding that participants in small-scale discussions typically have about where the discussion has gone, what remains to be addressed, and where they can best contribute. Without this kind of big picture, we run the risk of severely under-utilizing the collective intelligence potentially provided by large- scale social media." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "I believe that all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and that these principles now apply to capitalism. While the pursuit of profit is usually an effective motivator and resource allocator for creating productivity and for providing those who are productive with buying power, it is now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap to the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in jeopardy. That is because capitalism is now working in a way in which people and companies find it profitable to have policies and make technologies that lessen their people costs, which lessens a large percentage of the population’s share of society’s resources. Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children... As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

> "Not spending money on educating our children well might be good from a budget perspective, but it’s really stupid from an investment perspective. Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesn’t lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic picture—e.g., it doesn’t take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good “double bottom line” return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns)." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

Computer scientist Viktoras Veitas and philosopher David Weinbaum recently proposed a futuristic evolutionary paradigm, the ‘World of Views’, which may be useful to help us situate an exploration of the technocultural world. The ‘World of Views’ attempts to understand a post- scarcity, post-singularity, evolutionary landscape where the primary driver of change is the “multiplicity of unique, modular, and open co-evolving worldviews” (Veitas & Weinbaum 2015, p. 504)

TODO: the good regulator theorem (aka the Internal Model Principle) by Ross Ashby - any system that regulates/controls another system must have a model of that system ==> organisms model their environment
The law of requisite variety - tells us something about the computational sophistication of the internal model - the complexity of the model must be as complex as the challenges of the niche

evolution is an inference engine 
the organisms that persist are the models that are best able to predict the environment

TODO: landauer/landawer limit? written about at SFI by David someone - about energy efficiency

we can use the dynamics of a system on one level to predict/model the dynamics of the system on another level - all complex adaptive systems have some similar patterns
isomorphic relationship between different levels of emergence/complexity?
the principle of consequence capture is one such example that can be found on all levels

Bobby Azarian twitter DM: just listened to your 3rd appearance on the active inference channel where you talk about the isomorphism of some of the patterns of different levels of complex adaptive systems and I couldn't stop thinking about John Stewart's concept of consequence capture from his book Evolution's Arrow which is required for full alignment and for free riders to not outcompete altruists. Also Stigmergy.

SCREENSHOTS !!!





The modern research community knows they aren’t producing the best science they could be. There’s lots of
publication bias, statistics are done in a confusing and misleading way out of sheer inertia, and replications often
happen very late or not at all. And sometimes someone will say something like “I can’t believe people are too
dumb to fix Science. All we would have to do is require early registration of studies to avoid publication bias,
turn this new and powerful statistical technique into the new standard, and accord higher status to scientists who
do replication experiments. It would be really simple and it would vastly increase scientific progress. I must just
be smarter than all existing scientists, since I’m able to think of this and they aren’t.”
And yeah. That would work for the Science God. He could just make a Science Decree that everyone has to use
the right statistics, and make another Science Decree that everyone must accord replications higher status.
But things that work from a god’s-eye view don’t work from within the system. No individual scientist has an
incentive to unilaterally switch to the new statistical technique for her own research, since it would make her
research less likely to produce earth-shattering results and since it would just confuse all the other scientists.
They just have an incentive to want everybody else to do it, at which point they would follow along. And no
individual journal has an incentive to unilaterally switch to early registration and publishing negative results,
since it would just mean their results are less interesting than that other journal who only publishes ground-
breaking discoveries. From within the system, everyone is following their own incentives and will continue to do
so.
