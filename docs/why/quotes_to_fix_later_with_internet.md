Instead of confronting the problems inherent in an oligarchy, democracy denies it exists while practicing it openly. Oligarchy is not necessary, but it can only be overcome in a completely open and transparent system which allows the most widespread participation by all and knowledge for all and recognizes and accommodates expertise and greater levels of knowledge." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Representative democracies do not provide for expertise in governance as representatives are elected by land mass and time span, not system, and are usually elected for charisma, not expertise. Athenian sortition likewise made no attempt at combining expertise with authority. Subjects that the majority is unqualified to speak on are delegated to similarly unqualified political representatives, segregated from other representatives by land mass. These representatives appoint experts who obtain their positions by cronyism with the politician instead of expertise acknowledged by the entire interested population.
>
> The politicians and experts in the current system then provide for no meaningful feedback from users of the system, outside of occasional polls. These polls are conducted on test populations which another group have decided shall be considered representative of the population as a whole and used to provide input on only the questions the experts decide. There is no transparency of any meaningful kind that would allow users of the system to audit what the experts were doing.

> We can do better than this. We can govern by user groups, respect individual rights and global commons, and collaborate using stigmergy. We can belong to overlapping societies voluntarily by acceptance of social contracts.

> "The idea that only a lawyer can understand the law was created to disguise the undermining of the basic principles of society. In order for a social contract to be binding, the principles must be easily taught to anyone, including children.

The discouragement people once faced for obtaining online medical advice, particularly from their peers, is greatly compounded for legal advice. This must change. People must recreate the legal systems to work for them, and that requires direct involvement at every level in the creation and implementation of the laws.

Transparency in its literal sense, not selected pieces of isolated information wrapped up and presented by an official but full transparency, of the kind that would allow any passerby to see exactly what an organization was up to. As the current powers have been asking private individuals for decades, what do they have to hide? The kind of radical transparency that private individuals have been exposed to needs to be turned on all organizations and actions which have any impact on the public.

> "Representative democracies are part of a personality driven celebrity culture where people are encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups in any action they take. This has changed from recent history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated. People were encouraged to choose principles they supported and ensure those principles were met by any action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a personality driven system to those in power is it allows them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than simply negotiating each action on its own merits." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While intellectual property rights need to be abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the copyright or patent holders. Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is as common now as ever for a person with access to powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable to reach the public and use it to enhance their own reputation... Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use their work to glorify another." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While most action based systems can be completely open to participation by anyone, there are situations where an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or engineering are examples of this type of work. While accreditation can and should come from the user group and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in many cases can only be reviewed by those who have attained an above average level of specialized knowledge. In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of expertise attached to specific people, a situation not compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
>
> Idea based systems such as some scientific research, which should be open to all contributions, require extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual users. In many specialized systems such as the pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in every system which affects them, even if that information is completely transparent and available to all. In these systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users qualified to understand them.
>
> It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
>
> In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice must always be left with the entire user group. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only. Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains with the entire user group and the epistemic community is forced to remain completely transparent and permeable. Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user group controls whether those are implemented or created. This authority also provides the incentive for transparency and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "It is the responsibility of each user in an open system to educate themselves to their own level of comfort using the data and user population at each level to inform themselves. Their input and decision making impact would then be commensurate with the expertise they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users.

> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action.

> "Big history could be a chance to develop, eventually, a collective map making process to orient and guide humanity into the deeper future. What does it mean for future human action to be connected in a chain of evolutionary processes from the emergence of spacetime to the present? In this context big history has the opportunity to become simultaneously one story of our shared world as well as an infinite number of stories of how individuals can relate to that world and act in that world... Consequently, big history offers humanity a deeper perspective and an opportunity for cosmic reflection in relation to the meaning of human life from an exploration of the processes that culminated in our existence." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As a general principle, the more faithfully a society can store and transmit cultural information between cultural beings and across cultural generations, the less functional cultural information is lost (i.e. ‘backward slippage’), and the easier it becomes for any given cultural collective to build upon the complexity of inherited cultural knowledge (i.e. ‘ratcheting’). In this sense, the speed of cultural change is a rough function of the qualitative efficiency and quantitative number of conversations (i.e. idea sharing/sex) being conducted within and between individuals and populations." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We need different modes of sociopolitical governance. Complex systems science teaches us that local, bottom-up and distributed coordination are typically the most effective and capable mechanisms for enabling emergent global order in highly complex environments. This is because, in complex systems, there are simply too many differentiated parts for effective top- down mechanisms for coordination to stably function and synergize the whole. Thus any global systems science and serious sociopolitical global development agenda must understand how to maintain a new planetary organization with dynamic and distributed mechanisms that lead to self-organization (as opposed to static and hierarchical historical mechanisms that produce centralized organization)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

According to MST, higher levels of control organization can emerge from the coordination of less ordered subsystems. This type of higher coordination is hypothesized to emerge from the selection for more advanced information processing and communications, which enables previously disparate entities to synergistically coordinate their activities. Consequently, such systemic transitions change the relationship between the parts they are composed of, and (if successful) lead towards new emergent and stable characteristics of the whole, through the exploration of (in our context) new (sociotechnological) connections, new (sociotechnological) distinctions, and consequently, new (sociotechnological) possibility spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We must fundamentally rethink the nature of human controls: without the courage to acknowledge that nation-states are inadequate structures, globalization is ‘just a sham’. Part of the problem is that the psychology of the modern mind has been so fundamentally shaped by the nation-state that it is difficult for most to imagine the structure of a different world. However, remaining symbolically faithful to the nation-state, when its function as a structural control is so clearly endangering socioeconomic and ecological progress is dangerous as many of our most pressing problems related to economics, ecology and social space do not have borders (i.e. they are global, with an earth-space boundary only)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The emergence of the internet has created the foundations for an increasingly global world. In this context we must consider ways to approach a new form of globalization that is shaped by the whole of humanity. This will require a metasystem transition toward a higher level of systems complexity by reinventing the established control hierarchy. This reinvention could allow for the establishment of controls that maximize distributed intelligence and direct democracy within a digital medium that functions from ‘local to global’. Of course, this will require massive control innovation and a cultural revolution committed to radical distribution of concentrated power. Here we can learn from the founders of enlightenment if we have the daring to actually realize their transcendent dreams. There is no reason why control needs to possess a specific physical location in a truly mature information age. Instead, power could be distributed among all interconnected citizens in a multipolar Global Village. Such an organization should allow us to safely navigate the next frontier metasystem of humanity’s evolutionary experiment." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In the democratic form a small group of agents still defines problems and explores opportunities but must undergo constant change and replacement, and also must be subjected to constant feedback processes from the populous as a whole. In the theoretical commons form the center loses its ‘agential dimension’ and instead emerges from the collective interaction of agential consciousness. In this sense the center gains its coherence only from the distributed problem definition and opportunity exploration of the network of agential consciousness in-itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The failure of religious institutions, particular the Abrahamic religious institutions, to become more decentralized and distributed has arguably defined by their controversial existence throughout the industrial era. Indeed the majority of the atheist critique of religion has little to do with serious transcendental arguments related to the existence or nonexistence of God, and much more to do with social system repression, power and control, which is a feature of centralized and hierarchical organizations. Moreover there has been a recent flourishing of spiritual belief systems and spiritual practices that are capable of expressing the human relationship to the divine without the strict adherence to a single text or scripture.
>
> In this nuanced perspective it becomes difficult to know exactly how to interpret the future of religion with any absolute certainty. However, in the challenge propagation framework we can say that the future of spirituality or belief in the supernatural must figure out how to reinvent itself within the context of a structural reorganization of how humans relate to the spirit. Humans have inherent spiritual needs and these needs can manifest in many different ways. In order to foster this spiritual need for faith in a higher power or source or cause of existence the best practice in a challenge propagation framework would be to create the discursive spaces where a real active dialogue about spirituality and faith can emerge. These discursive spaces need not represent one religious leader or one religious domination but allow for conceptual boundaries to be flexible and dynamic and contingent on the needs expressed in the dialogue.
>
> If this model is useful in a prescriptive and predictive context then the future spiritual communities will be built on distributed emergence, without the need for permanent leaders, authorities or denomination. This in fact mirrors the patterns we discussed in regards to the future of governance. In essence, religious organizations need to become more decentralized and distributed so that ideas of how the human spirit or consciousness relates to its existential condition can be expressed with less friction or distortion. This would allow different religious groups or identities to move past any theological divisions and find a common meaning or purpose for the twenty-first century that is more in-line with religion’s core drive which is to provide an outlet for people to explore their relationship to the unknown or unknowable.

> In this context religion can be revived by focusing on the very real dimension of problems for consciousness that have no final or complete answer but are rather fundamental mysteries of the historical process. Some of these very real dimensions include an understanding of universal ethics or morality, the structure of life and death, the design or construction or creation of the universe and the meaning of society and experience in a cosmic context. These dimensions of inquiry are as pressing for contemporary consciousness as they have ever been for consciousness. Thus the possibility for a revived understanding of spirituality and human relation to religion is now an informational potentiality which requires us to rethink a meaningful structure to information control." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The theoretical emphasis in technological singularity literature (i.e. emergence of AGI) almost completely ignores the systemic dynamics of technological revolution in relation to the emerging sociotechnological sphere mediated by the totality of the internet as universal medium. In missing this systemic dynamic the technological singularity literature fails to even confront basic issues of systemic transitions in relation to control, power and hierarchy, and thus basic issues of systemic transitions in terms of social, economic and political life." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the AGI technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on individual machine-learning programs that enter ‘self-recursive cycles’ of exponential intellect improvement towards ‘post-humanity’. However, in the GB technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on collective global issues and metasystemic transitions related to power, control and hierarchy. This is not to say that the GB technological singularity vision totally negates the possibility of the emergence of AGI or even post-humanity, but rather approaches the emerging technological revolution as a phenomenon that must be grounded in the totality of sociotechnological process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In this sense what is wrong with most socioeconomic or sociotechnological thinking today is that it precisely ignores the most important element, i.e. the subjective dimension of socio-processes. At the structural ‘micro-foundations’ of capitalism is the subjective valuation of profit as hegemonic to all other forms of value. Thus, in the same way that a few people thinking in a new way about money and what to do with money due to the rise of new forms of industrial productive potential in the 19th century changed the socioeconomic conditions of the human world (i.e. universal subjective valuation of profit maximization via market exchange over and above all other values), we should again, simply, go back to the ‘micro-foundations’, think new forms of subjective valuation, and draw out their large-scale socioeconomic consequences, i.e. what would be the resulting ‘macro-foundations’ as ‘large-scale political collectives’ that developed due to new ‘micro-foundations’?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Is there not a way to organize the human world with a more distributed and open-ended understanding of subjective valuation so that the homogenizing dimension of ‘profit-maximization as human nature’ could be replaced with a multi-dimensional and processual understanding of human nature?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "An ‘offer network’ as a basic mechanic for the collaborative commons would be described as ‘fields of societal exchange facilitating the self-organization of goods/services built on the foundation of trust and reputation as a primary bonding mechanisms’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Can the Global Brain as a ‘universal coordination medium’ that ‘self-organizes on a planetary level’ function to inscribe a world that operates on ‘Global Commons’ logic (systems of access and democratic management) over and above both market and state logic? Would this not be a world where ‘automated smart systems’ and ‘distributed social/offer networks’ become universalized towards serving humanist-ecological use value?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom set out to articulate how the ‘state/market’ could be broken with a ‘radical third’ of a commons as ‘institutions for collective action’ with a specific focus on their establishment and management. In other words, instead of systems controlling property and labour (nation-states), or systems producing and consuming commodities (markets), the commons are systems for managing and distributing shared resources and spaces with a core of direct democracy (as opposed to representative democracy). For Ostrom, one of the key notions for the successful establishment and maintenance of a commons based on access is how these systems identify and properly manage ‘Common Pool Resources’ (CPR), which she identifies as resources and spaces that are inherently ‘common’ but also ‘scarce’ and thus ‘rival’. In other words, overcoming the problem of establishing and managing CPRs in a commons is the foundation for ‘de-commodification’ and ‘opening a commonwealth’, and perhaps, the key shift in transforming neoliberal institutions (and the multinational corporations that thrive under their reign) into commons institutions capable of establishing an automated and collaborative commons.
>
> In this frame a resource/space an be generally defined as a CPR if one agent/persons use of the resource/space will subtract from any other agent/persons use and where it is often necessary, but difficult and costly, to exclude another agent/persons use outside the group from using the resource/space. Here there are numerous and extremely diverse examples of such ‘rival/scarce’ resources/spaces that could be classified as a ‘CPR’: fishers, grazing grounds, parks, farms, transportation grids, and so forth. In Ostrom’s analysis of systems for collective action that benefit the common good (i.e. higher levels of cooperation) there are always simple yet fundamental problems related to (Ostrom 1990, p. 27):
>
> A) Coping with free-riding
>
> B) Solving commitment problems
>
> C) Arranging for the supply of new institutions, and
>
> D) Monitoring individual compliance with sets of rules
>
> Furthermore, Ostrom did not just identify the problems that prevent the emergence and stabilization of commons institutions for collective action, but also identified key ‘design principles’ that can solve these problems, which include (Ostrom 1990, p. 90):
>
> A) Group boundaries clearly defined
>
> B) Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions
>
> C) Most individuals affected by these rules can participate in modifying the rules
>
> D) The rights of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
>
> E) A system for monitoring member’s behaviour exists; the community members themselves undertake this monitoring
>
> F) A graduate system of sanctions is used
>
> G) Community members have access to low-cost conflict resolution mechanisms
>
> H) For CPRs that are parts of larger systems: appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises
>
> The first thing for GB theorists to note here is the difficulty in understanding and implementing the relation between the ‘local’ dimension and the ‘global’ dimension. In other words, although both the automated and collaborative functions of the commons would ideally fall within a universal medium that intelligently satisfied all human necessities - some form of ‘post- monetary’ ‘offer network’ (Goertzel 2015; Heylighen 2016b) - this universal medium must also be nested in order to meet CPR demands on multiple interacting levels, e.g. regional, continental, international and global. On the practical level there are functions of human civilization that operate on different levels of organization, e.g. regional health facilities require different commons demands than do international transportation networks or global environmental problems, etc. But on the second societal and cultural level there is the simple fact that real groups and communities exist at multiple levels with specific needs and desires that cannot be totally ignored and replaced with a totalizing and ideological abstract universalism (i.e. ‘We are all One world community, and so forth’). Thus, the point of Ostrom’s commons ‘design principles’ is that, although they complicate the situation of establishing and maintaining a commons, they are at the same time necessary preconditions for the commons long-term viability as well the growth of pluralism and diversity within a new universal level of organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter- intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self- reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "When we think of the technocultural era in big historical terms we are not so much confronted with the future of ‘humans’ (as we typically think of humans) but the future of self-designed intelligent-spiritual ‘beings’ self-organized towards a higher level of thought... The technological singularity concept forces us to imagine a black hole of experience, an event horizon beyond which we could know nothing for certain about the deep future. In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The combination of higher energy flow, information processing, cultural differentiation and sociopolitical integration could create the foundations for an emergent organization with a far higher possibility space than any historical society. This shift will include a qualitative leap in all of the dimensions of our personal lives, including how we relate to our own mind and life, how we relate to the world, and how we relate to each other (not to mention who we call ‘we’) (Hofstadter 2003). Historically, these dimensions of our experience have been shaped by our evolved biological perceptions, the replication of our symbolic structures, and the sociopolitical structures of historical civilization. However, in a technocultural world the mechanisms for sensory perception, replication of symbolic structures and sociopolitical organization will all have foundationally changed, likely leading towards a planetary network of unprecedented cultural and technological creation: tens of billions of minds in free association, exploring deeper levels of interconnection, and internal/external reflection than possible within a purely biological substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Being are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Beyond immortality the deepest possibilities and surprises of the technocultural world will likely come, not from radical life extension, but from radical life expansion, in terms of cognitive growth and interconnection. Therefore, when we explore the technocultural world experientially, we reach a world of deeply integrated minds in planetary interconnection, and whatever that interconnection will birth." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cyberneticist Valentin Turchin thoughtfully contemplated the possibility of a deeply integrated human super-being (1977, p. 259): “How far will integration of individuals go? There is no doubt that in the future (and perhaps not too far in the future) direct exchange of information among nervous systems of individual people (leading to their physical integration) will become possible.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Art was a qualitative emergence that resulted from the increased informational transfer abilities acquired through the expansion of the neocortex and the evolution of language. Of course the same goes for the other uniquely human cultural activities like sciences, poetry, philosophy, mathematics, music, etc. Thus in the past we have clear evidence that quantitative increases in brain capacity can lead to the radical emergence of new qualitative properties which then proceed to play a dominant causal role in future evolutionary processes. What new symbolic or mind properties will emerge from a further technological expansion of the neocortex and further evolution of language towards closer mind-to-mind communication? And what will emerge from the new ecosystems of purely technological mind?
>
> Technocultural beings will be able to share extraordinary high levels of information at the speed of light, and via much more reliable mechanisms, likely via direct mind connection with others and with our collective computer networks (i.e. our ‘digital twins’ or ‘personal AIs’) (Kurzweil 2014). That is to say that the (practically) instant transmission of information files (for example: books, movies, music, photographs etc.) could be transferred between minds directly and understood near-instantaneously. All minds would have a dramatically expanded understanding of acquired knowledge, allowing for an unprecedented level of ‘cultural ratcheting’ (Tennie et al. 2009) or ‘collective learning’ (Christian 2004). The generational barriers towards knowledge transfer may even by completely overcome. Beings would also be able to communicate vast reaches of their mind through virtual recreations of any and all varieties in mediums of expression that currently do not exist.
>
> But these are the quantitative aspects of future mind. The qualitative aspects are much harder to describe and anticipate, as they will be emergent in their very nature, potentially enabling new forms of game, adventure, exploration, ecstasy and mystery in physical spaces, but also intersubjective virtual spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

Computer scientist Viktoras Veitas and philosopher David Weinbaum recently proposed a futuristic evolutionary paradigm, the ‘World of Views’, which may be useful to help us situate an exploration of the technocultural world. The ‘World of Views’ attempts to understand a post- scarcity, post-singularity, evolutionary landscape where the primary driver of change is the “multiplicity of unique, modular, and open co-evolving worldviews” (Veitas & Weinbaum 2015, p. 504)
