Instead of confronting the problems inherent in an oligarchy, democracy denies it exists while practicing it openly. Oligarchy is not necessary, but it can only be overcome in a completely open and transparent system which allows the most widespread participation by all and knowledge for all and recognizes and accommodates expertise and greater levels of knowledge." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Representative democracies do not provide for expertise in governance as representatives are elected by land mass and time span, not system, and are usually elected for charisma, not expertise. Athenian sortition likewise made no attempt at combining expertise with authority. Subjects that the majority is unqualified to speak on are delegated to similarly unqualified political representatives, segregated from other representatives by land mass. These representatives appoint experts who obtain their positions by cronyism with the politician instead of expertise acknowledged by the entire interested population.
>
> The politicians and experts in the current system then provide for no meaningful feedback from users of the system, outside of occasional polls. These polls are conducted on test populations which another group have decided shall be considered representative of the population as a whole and used to provide input on only the questions the experts decide. There is no transparency of any meaningful kind that would allow users of the system to audit what the experts were doing.

> We can do better than this. We can govern by user groups, respect individual rights and global commons, and collaborate using stigmergy. We can belong to overlapping societies voluntarily by acceptance of social contracts.

> "The idea that only a lawyer can understand the law was created to disguise the undermining of the basic principles of society. In order for a social contract to be binding, the principles must be easily taught to anyone, including children.

The discouragement people once faced for obtaining online medical advice, particularly from their peers, is greatly compounded for legal advice. This must change. People must recreate the legal systems to work for them, and that requires direct involvement at every level in the creation and implementation of the laws.

Transparency in its literal sense, not selected pieces of isolated information wrapped up and presented by an official but full transparency, of the kind that would allow any passerby to see exactly what an organization was up to. As the current powers have been asking private individuals for decades, what do they have to hide? The kind of radical transparency that private individuals have been exposed to needs to be turned on all organizations and actions which have any impact on the public.

> "Representative democracies are part of a personality driven celebrity culture where people are encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups in any action they take. This has changed from recent history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated. People were encouraged to choose principles they supported and ensure those principles were met by any action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a personality driven system to those in power is it allows them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than simply negotiating each action on its own merits." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While intellectual property rights need to be abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the copyright or patent holders. Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is as common now as ever for a person with access to powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable to reach the public and use it to enhance their own reputation... Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use their work to glorify another." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While most action based systems can be completely open to participation by anyone, there are situations where an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or engineering are examples of this type of work. While accreditation can and should come from the user group and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in many cases can only be reviewed by those who have attained an above average level of specialized knowledge. In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of expertise attached to specific people, a situation not compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
>
> Idea based systems such as some scientific research, which should be open to all contributions, require extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual users. In many specialized systems such as the pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in every system which affects them, even if that information is completely transparent and available to all. In these systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users qualified to understand them.
>
> It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
>
> In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice must always be left with the entire user group. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only. Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains with the entire user group and the epistemic community is forced to remain completely transparent and permeable. Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user group controls whether those are implemented or created. This authority also provides the incentive for transparency and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "It is the responsibility of each user in an open system to educate themselves to their own level of comfort using the data and user population at each level to inform themselves. Their input and decision making impact would then be commensurate with the expertise they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users.

> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action.

> "Big history could be a chance to develop, eventually, a collective map making process to orient and guide humanity into the deeper future. What does it mean for future human action to be connected in a chain of evolutionary processes from the emergence of spacetime to the present? In this context big history has the opportunity to become simultaneously one story of our shared world as well as an infinite number of stories of how individuals can relate to that world and act in that world... Consequently, big history offers humanity a deeper perspective and an opportunity for cosmic reflection in relation to the meaning of human life from an exploration of the processes that culminated in our existence." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As a general principle, the more faithfully a society can store and transmit cultural information between cultural beings and across cultural generations, the less functional cultural information is lost (i.e. ‘backward slippage’), and the easier it becomes for any given cultural collective to build upon the complexity of inherited cultural knowledge (i.e. ‘ratcheting’). In this sense, the speed of cultural change is a rough function of the qualitative efficiency and quantitative number of conversations (i.e. idea sharing/sex) being conducted within and between individuals and populations." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We need different modes of sociopolitical governance. Complex systems science teaches us that local, bottom-up and distributed coordination are typically the most effective and capable mechanisms for enabling emergent global order in highly complex environments. This is because, in complex systems, there are simply too many differentiated parts for effective top- down mechanisms for coordination to stably function and synergize the whole. Thus any global systems science and serious sociopolitical global development agenda must understand how to maintain a new planetary organization with dynamic and distributed mechanisms that lead to self-organization (as opposed to static and hierarchical historical mechanisms that produce centralized organization)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

According to MST, higher levels of control organization can emerge from the coordination of less ordered subsystems. This type of higher coordination is hypothesized to emerge from the selection for more advanced information processing and communications, which enables previously disparate entities to synergistically coordinate their activities. Consequently, such systemic transitions change the relationship between the parts they are composed of, and (if successful) lead towards new emergent and stable characteristics of the whole, through the exploration of (in our context) new (sociotechnological) connections, new (sociotechnological) distinctions, and consequently, new (sociotechnological) possibility spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We must fundamentally rethink the nature of human controls: without the courage to acknowledge that nation-states are inadequate structures, globalization is ‘just a sham’. Part of the problem is that the psychology of the modern mind has been so fundamentally shaped by the nation-state that it is difficult for most to imagine the structure of a different world. However, remaining symbolically faithful to the nation-state, when its function as a structural control is so clearly endangering socioeconomic and ecological progress is dangerous as many of our most pressing problems related to economics, ecology and social space do not have borders (i.e. they are global, with an earth-space boundary only)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The emergence of the internet has created the foundations for an increasingly global world. In this context we must consider ways to approach a new form of globalization that is shaped by the whole of humanity. This will require a metasystem transition toward a higher level of systems complexity by reinventing the established control hierarchy. This reinvention could allow for the establishment of controls that maximize distributed intelligence and direct democracy within a digital medium that functions from ‘local to global’. Of course, this will require massive control innovation and a cultural revolution committed to radical distribution of concentrated power. Here we can learn from the founders of enlightenment if we have the daring to actually realize their transcendent dreams. There is no reason why control needs to possess a specific physical location in a truly mature information age. Instead, power could be distributed among all interconnected citizens in a multipolar Global Village. Such an organization should allow us to safely navigate the next frontier metasystem of humanity’s evolutionary experiment." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In the democratic form a small group of agents still defines problems and explores opportunities but must undergo constant change and replacement, and also must be subjected to constant feedback processes from the populous as a whole. In the theoretical commons form the center loses its ‘agential dimension’ and instead emerges from the collective interaction of agential consciousness. In this sense the center gains its coherence only from the distributed problem definition and opportunity exploration of the network of agential consciousness in-itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The failure of religious institutions, particular the Abrahamic religious institutions, to become more decentralized and distributed has arguably defined by their controversial existence throughout the industrial era. Indeed the majority of the atheist critique of religion has little to do with serious transcendental arguments related to the existence or nonexistence of God, and much more to do with social system repression, power and control, which is a feature of centralized and hierarchical organizations. Moreover there has been a recent flourishing of spiritual belief systems and spiritual practices that are capable of expressing the human relationship to the divine without the strict adherence to a single text or scripture.
>
> In this nuanced perspective it becomes difficult to know exactly how to interpret the future of religion with any absolute certainty. However, in the challenge propagation framework we can say that the future of spirituality or belief in the supernatural must figure out how to reinvent itself within the context of a structural reorganization of how humans relate to the spirit. Humans have inherent spiritual needs and these needs can manifest in many different ways. In order to foster this spiritual need for faith in a higher power or source or cause of existence the best practice in a challenge propagation framework would be to create the discursive spaces where a real active dialogue about spirituality and faith can emerge. These discursive spaces need not represent one religious leader or one religious domination but allow for conceptual boundaries to be flexible and dynamic and contingent on the needs expressed in the dialogue.
>
> If this model is useful in a prescriptive and predictive context then the future spiritual communities will be built on distributed emergence, without the need for permanent leaders, authorities or denomination. This in fact mirrors the patterns we discussed in regards to the future of governance. In essence, religious organizations need to become more decentralized and distributed so that ideas of how the human spirit or consciousness relates to its existential condition can be expressed with less friction or distortion. This would allow different religious groups or identities to move past any theological divisions and find a common meaning or purpose for the twenty-first century that is more in-line with religion’s core drive which is to provide an outlet for people to explore their relationship to the unknown or unknowable.

> In this context religion can be revived by focusing on the very real dimension of problems for consciousness that have no final or complete answer but are rather fundamental mysteries of the historical process. Some of these very real dimensions include an understanding of universal ethics or morality, the structure of life and death, the design or construction or creation of the universe and the meaning of society and experience in a cosmic context. These dimensions of inquiry are as pressing for contemporary consciousness as they have ever been for consciousness. Thus the possibility for a revived understanding of spirituality and human relation to religion is now an informational potentiality which requires us to rethink a meaningful structure to information control." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The theoretical emphasis in technological singularity literature (i.e. emergence of AGI) almost completely ignores the systemic dynamics of technological revolution in relation to the emerging sociotechnological sphere mediated by the totality of the internet as universal medium. In missing this systemic dynamic the technological singularity literature fails to even confront basic issues of systemic transitions in relation to control, power and hierarchy, and thus basic issues of systemic transitions in terms of social, economic and political life." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the AGI technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on individual machine-learning programs that enter ‘self-recursive cycles’ of exponential intellect improvement towards ‘post-humanity’. However, in the GB technological singularity vision humanity’s attention becomes focused on collective global issues and metasystemic transitions related to power, control and hierarchy. This is not to say that the GB technological singularity vision totally negates the possibility of the emergence of AGI or even post-humanity, but rather approaches the emerging technological revolution as a phenomenon that must be grounded in the totality of sociotechnological process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In this sense what is wrong with most socioeconomic or sociotechnological thinking today is that it precisely ignores the most important element, i.e. the subjective dimension of socio-processes. At the structural ‘micro-foundations’ of capitalism is the subjective valuation of profit as hegemonic to all other forms of value. Thus, in the same way that a few people thinking in a new way about money and what to do with money due to the rise of new forms of industrial productive potential in the 19th century changed the socioeconomic conditions of the human world (i.e. universal subjective valuation of profit maximization via market exchange over and above all other values), we should again, simply, go back to the ‘micro-foundations’, think new forms of subjective valuation, and draw out their large-scale socioeconomic consequences, i.e. what would be the resulting ‘macro-foundations’ as ‘large-scale political collectives’ that developed due to new ‘micro-foundations’?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom set out to articulate how the ‘state/market’ could be broken with a ‘radical third’ of a commons as ‘institutions for collective action’ with a specific focus on their establishment and management. In other words, instead of systems controlling property and labour (nation-states), or systems producing and consuming commodities (markets), the commons are systems for managing and distributing shared resources and spaces with a core of direct democracy (as opposed to representative democracy). For Ostrom, one of the key notions for the successful establishment and maintenance of a commons based on access is how these systems identify and properly manage ‘Common Pool Resources’ (CPR), which she identifies as resources and spaces that are inherently ‘common’ but also ‘scarce’ and thus ‘rival’. In other words, overcoming the problem of establishing and managing CPRs in a commons is the foundation for ‘de-commodification’ and ‘opening a commonwealth’, and perhaps, the key shift in transforming neoliberal institutions (and the multinational corporations that thrive under their reign) into commons institutions capable of establishing an automated and collaborative commons.
>
> In this frame a resource/space an be generally defined as a CPR if one agent/persons use of the resource/space will subtract from any other agent/persons use and where it is often necessary, but difficult and costly, to exclude another agent/persons use outside the group from using the resource/space. Here there are numerous and extremely diverse examples of such ‘rival/scarce’ resources/spaces that could be classified as a ‘CPR’: fishers, grazing grounds, parks, farms, transportation grids, and so forth. In Ostrom’s analysis of systems for collective action that benefit the common good (i.e. higher levels of cooperation) there are always simple yet fundamental problems related to (Ostrom 1990, p. 27):

>
> A) Group boundaries clearly defined
>
> B) Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions

> The first thing for GB theorists to note here is the difficulty in understanding and implementing the relation between the ‘local’ dimension and the ‘global’ dimension. In other words, although both the automated and collaborative functions of the commons would ideally fall within a universal medium that intelligently satisfied all human necessities - some form of ‘post- monetary’ ‘offer network’ (Goertzel 2015; Heylighen 2016b) - this universal medium must also be nested in order to meet CPR demands on multiple interacting levels, e.g. regional, continental, international and global. On the practical level there are functions of human civilization that operate on different levels of organization, e.g. regional health facilities require different commons demands than do international transportation networks or global environmental problems, etc. But on the second societal and cultural level there is the simple fact that real groups and communities exist at multiple levels with specific needs and desires that cannot be totally ignored and replaced with a totalizing and ideological abstract universalism (i.e. ‘We are all One world community, and so forth’). Thus, the point of Ostrom’s commons ‘design principles’ is that, although they complicate the situation of establishing and maintaining a commons, they are at the same time necessary preconditions for the commons long-term viability as well the growth of pluralism and diversity within a new universal level of organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter- intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self- reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "When we think of the technocultural era in big historical terms we are not so much confronted with the future of ‘humans’ (as we typically think of humans) but the future of self-designed intelligent-spiritual ‘beings’ self-organized towards a higher level of thought... The technological singularity concept forces us to imagine a black hole of experience, an event horizon beyond which we could know nothing for certain about the deep future. In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The combination of higher energy flow, information processing, cultural differentiation and sociopolitical integration could create the foundations for an emergent organization with a far higher possibility space than any historical society. This shift will include a qualitative leap in all of the dimensions of our personal lives, including how we relate to our own mind and life, how we relate to the world, and how we relate to each other (not to mention who we call ‘we’) (Hofstadter 2003). Historically, these dimensions of our experience have been shaped by our evolved biological perceptions, the replication of our symbolic structures, and the sociopolitical structures of historical civilization. However, in a technocultural world the mechanisms for sensory perception, replication of symbolic structures and sociopolitical organization will all have foundationally changed, likely leading towards a planetary network of unprecedented cultural and technological creation: tens of billions of minds in free association, exploring deeper levels of interconnection, and internal/external reflection than possible within a purely biological substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Being are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Beyond immortality the deepest possibilities and surprises of the technocultural world will likely come, not from radical life extension, but from radical life expansion, in terms of cognitive growth and interconnection.

> "Cyberneticist Valentin Turchin thoughtfully contemplated the possibility of a deeply integrated human super-being (1977, p. 259): “How far will integration of individuals go?

> "Art was a qualitative emergence that resulted from the increased informational transfer abilities acquired through the expansion of the neocortex and the evolution of language. Of course the same goes for the other uniquely human cultural activities like sciences, poetry, philosophy, mathematics, music, etc. Thus in the past we have clear evidence that quantitative increases in brain capacity can lead to the radical emergence of new qualitative properties which then proceed to play a dominant causal role in future evolutionary processes. What new symbolic or mind properties will emerge from a further technological expansion of the neocortex and further evolution of language towards closer mind-to-mind communication? And what will emerge from the new ecosystems of purely technological mind?
>
> Technocultural beings will be able to share extraordinary high levels of information at the speed of light, and via much more reliable mechanisms, likely via direct mind connection with others and with our collective computer networks (i.e. our ‘digital twins’ or ‘personal AIs’) (Kurzweil 2014). That is to say that the (practically) instant transmission of information files (for example: books, movies, music, photographs etc.) could be transferred between minds directly and understood near-instantaneously. All minds would have a dramatically expanded understanding of acquired knowledge, allowing for an unprecedented level of ‘cultural ratcheting’ (Tennie et al. 2009) or ‘collective learning’ (Christian 2004). The generational barriers towards knowledge transfer may even by completely overcome. Beings would also be able to communicate vast reaches of their mind through virtual recreations of any and all varieties in mediums of expression that currently do not exist.

> "The difficulty we face in trying to evaluate [the future of intelligence] at our current scale of intelligence would be similar to the challenge facing an intelligent bacterium in our gut that is trying to make sense of the social interactions we engage in." - [John Stewart](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most simple and common definition of intelligence is the ability to solve problems. A problem can be defined as a difference between the present situation (the initial state), and an ideal or desired situation (the goal state or solution). Problem solving then means finding a path through the “problem space” that leads from the initial state (say, x) to the goal (say, y). This requires determining the right sequence of steps that leads from x to y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Intelligence is highly context-dependent: more important than the absolute number of problems you can solve, is whether you can solve the most significant problems in your present environment. Adding the capability to solve some purely theoretical problems that are of no use in your present or future environment will in general not increase your fitness (i.e. probability of long-term survival)—and may even decrease it if it would make you waste time on contemplating irrelevant issues." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The simplest model of intelligence is a look-up table or mapping. This is a list of condition-action rules, of the form: if your problem is x, then the (action you need to perform to attain the) solution is y. In short: if x, then y, or, even shorter: x → y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The next, more complex model of intelligence is a deterministic algorithm. This is a fixed-length or iterated sequence of actions that need to be performed on the initial state, until the state they produce satisfies the condition for being a solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The view of problem solving as computation or as heuristic search seems to imply a sequential process, in which the different steps are performed one by one. A first step in our intended generalization towards distributed, parallel processes is the reinterpretation of problem solving as information processing. The initial state or problem statement can be interpreted as a piece of information received by the agent. The solution of the problem is a new piece of information produced by the agent in response to the problem statement. The task of the intelligent agent is then to transform or process the input information (problem, initial state, “question”) via a number of intermediate stages into the output information (solution, goal state, “answer”)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Compared to the sequential models of intelligence, neural networks have two big advantages:
>
> 1) processing happens in a parallel, distributed manner, making it more robust and flexible;
>
> 2) the network does not need an explicit program to know how it should function: it can learn from experience.
>
> The distributed character of neural networks means that its information and “knowledge” are not localized in a single component: they are spread out across all the nodes and links, which together contribute to the final solution. This makes the processing much more robust: individual components may be missing, malfunctioning or contain errors; yet, the disturbances this introduces to the process are drowned out by the contributions from the other components when everything is aggregated. In a sequential process, on the other hand, every step or component through which the process passes constitutes a bottleneck: if that component breaks down, the process may never recover.
>
> The learning happens via a general “reward” or reinforcement mechanism: links that have been successfully used in producing a good solution become stronger; the others become weaker. After many experiences of successful or failed processing, the relative strengths of the different connections will have shifted so that the probability of overall success has become much larger. This intrinsically simple mechanism only works for complex problems because of the distributed character of the processing: if only the process as a whole could be rewarded or punished, this would not produce enough information for it to learn a complex, subtle procedure consisting of many different actions collaborating towards a global solution. Because the process is distributed, its components can learn individually, so that the one can be reinforced at the same time as its neighbor is weakened, thus rebalancing their relative contributions." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The view of intelligence as a capability for problem solving or information processing runs into a fundamental issue: what is a meaningful problem, or meaningful information? Why should an intelligent agent address certain problems or process certain information, and disregard others? In other words, how does an agent decide what to do or pay attention to? In the approach of traditional artificial intelligence (AI), this issue is ignored, as AI programs are conceived essentially as question-answering systems: the user or programmer introduces the question (problem, query, input), and the program responds with an answer (solution, output).
>
> On the other hand, the issue becomes inevitable once you start to design autonomous systems, i.e. systems that should be able to act intelligently in the absence of an instructor telling them what to do. Such a system should at least have a value system, i.e. a set of explicit or implicit criteria that allow it distinguish “good” outcomes from “bad” ones. Given the ability to evaluate or value phenomena, the agent can then itself decide what aspects of its situation are “problematic” and therefore require some solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The difference between positive (growth) and negative (deficiency) values roughly corresponds to the difference between positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions (e.g. fear, anger, or sadness) occur when a need is frustrated or threatened, i.e. when the agent encounters a perturbation that it may not be able to compensate. Positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, curiosity) on the other hand, function to broaden your domain of interest and build up cognitive, material, or social resources. In other words, they motivate you to connect, explore, play, seek challenges, learn, experience, etc. Negative emotions tend to narrowly focus your attention to the problem at hand, so that you can invest all your resources in tackling that problem; positive emotions tend to widen your field of attention so that it becomes open to discovering new opportunities for growth.
>
> A general theory of values should encompass both positive or growth values, and negative or deficiency values. The present paper will not further develop such a theory. Yet, it is worth pointing out that such a theory would be an important contribution to a general model of intelligence and of the global brain, and therefore definitely worth investigating. Some inspiration can be found in the various psychological theories of motivation or needs, which include fundamental needs/values such as security, social affiliation, achievement and knowledge. More generally, from an evolutionary perspective, all values can be derived from the fundamental value of fitness (survival, development, and reproduction), since natural selection has ensured that agents that did not successfully strive for fitness have been eliminated from the scene." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Valence can be understood as the subjective appreciation by an agent of the global utility, well-being or fitness offered by a particular phenomenon or situation. It can be formalized as a scalar variable, which is larger than zero for positive situations, smaller than zero for negative ones, and zero for neutral or indifferent ones." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "A challenge is a situation that carries valence for an agent, so that the agent is inclined to act, in the case of negative valence by suppressing the perceived disturbance(s), in the case of positive valence by exploring or exploiting the perceived opportunity(ies). More concisely, we can define a challenge as a phenomenon that invites action from an agent. Negative challenges correspond to what we have called problems; positive challenges represent affordances for growth or progress. But note that these are not opposites but independent dimensions, since a challenge can carry both positive and negative valences. For example, for a hunter, encounter with a wild boar is both an opportunity, since a wild boar has tasty meat, and a problem, since a wild boar is dangerous. For a company, a free trade agreement can be both positive, since it gives access to new clients, and negative, since it opens the door to new competitors. A challenge incites action because it represents a situation in which not acting will lead to an overall lower fitness than acting—because the agent gains fitness by taking action, loses fitness by not taking action, or both. Thus, a challenge can be seen as a promise of fitness gain for action relative to inaction.
>
> However, a challenge merely inspires or stimulates action, it does not impose it. The reason is that a complex situation will typically present many challenging phenomena, and the agent will not be able to act on all of them. For example, someone surfing the web typically encounters many pages that seem worth investigating, but obviously cannot read all of them. We may assume that an agent is intrinsically capable of choice, and that this choice will be determined partly by subjective preferences, partly by situational influences, partly by chance, i.e. intrinsically unpredictable, “random” fluctuations. Therefore, it is in general impossible to determine exactly how an agent will react to a situation, although it should be possible to derive statistical regularities about the most common choices. The implication for modeling is that an agent should not be represented as a deterministic automaton, but as a stochastic system, which may make different decisions in apparently identical cases, but where it is meaningful to specify conditional probabilities for the different choices, so that in a given condition e.g. 50% of agents can be expected to make choice A, 30% choice B, and 20% choice C.
>
> One of the reasons for this unpredictability is that agents have bounded rationality19: they normally never have all the information or cognitive abilities necessary to evaluate the different challenges. They, therefore have to make “informed guesses” about the best course of action to take. Moreover, assuming that similar agents tend to look for similar resources, it is worth making a choice different from the choice of the others, so as to avoid competition for scarce resources. In addition to positivity and negativity, other dimensions worth considering in order to compare challenges are:
>
> - prospect (in how far can the agent foresee the different aspects or implications of the challenge?),
>
> - difficulty (how much effort would be involved in tackling the challenge?), and
>
> - mystery (in how far would tackling this challenge increase the agent’s prospect concerning other challenges?)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "A difference between simple relaxation models and challenge models is that intelligent agents (as living or artificial systems), unlike physical systems, must remain in a far-from-equilibrium state: they are constantly active, consuming energy, and trying to avoid at all costs a complete standstill (i.e. death). Therefore, while they are inclined to relax existing challenges, they will also seek new challenges (affordances, resources, opportunities), unlike physical systems. In that sense, a “challenge relaxing” dynamics only describes part of their behavior, and must be complemented by a “challenge seeking” dynamics that is better described by some form of active exploration. This is the equivalent of what we have called positive or growth values. It is illustrated in the brain by the fact that thinking never stops: activation does not simply diffuse until it fades away; action potentials are continuously generated by the brain itself, even in the absence of outside stimuli that play the role of challenges needing to be relaxed." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The challenge seeking dynamics can be represented by the fact that the agents are constantly confronted by a variety of new challenges, and that they are motivated to pick out the most challenging one of those as soon as the previous challenge has been relaxed. These challenges have an external origin: they are produced by the agent’s environment (which includes other agents as well as the natural and technological environment). We may assume that this environment is in a constant flux, so that agents are “showered” with challenging phenomena. Each of those is an opportunity to extract valence by acting." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Challenges have been defined as “invitations” to act, which means that the agent is not forced to take up the invitation. This is necessary because in general many challenges vie for an agent’s attention, and not all can be taken up. This becomes particularly clear if we imagine a hunter-gatherer exploring a stretch of rain forest with its thousands of varied stimuli, or a person surfing the web with it millions of potentially interesting pages. The agent’s capabilities for cognitive processing and action are limited, and therefore a selection must be made between these myriads of potentially important challenges. A model of challenge propagation ideally should include a system of selection criteria and mechanisms that help the agent single out the most significant challenges—however, without assuming that there is a single most important one.
>
> Some work that may be of help here is Baars’s model of consciousness, which assumes that within the brain many stimuli and thoughts compete for attention. However, only a single one can be amplified to the degree that it comes to dominate the “global workspace” that interconnects all the more specialized brain regions. From this workspace, the thoughts selected to be most important for conscious attention are “broadcasted” to the whole brain. This model presupposes a positive feedback mechanism where strongly activated thoughts become even stronger, while suppressing weaker ones, until a single “winner” remains. This is an example of the “winner-takes-it-all” dynamic common in non-linear, self- organizing systems. The suppression requires a mechanism of neural inhibition that may use some form of negative activation.
>
> Research on attention and consciousness (see my lecture notes on “Cognitive Systems” for a review) points to unexpectedness and valence as major criteria for winning the competition: stimuli that are surprising, and/or that are highly relevant for the present goal tend to attract most attention. The valence criterion is most obvious, as challenges that promise a higher reward than others deserve more attention." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "We are left with three fundamental criteria for deciding which challenges are most worth attending to: valence, surprise, and clarity. An agent is most likely to act on a challenge that entails high value (large potential gains or losses), that is mysterious, unusual or surprising, and where there is minimal uncertainty or ambiguity about how to act. Note that the surprise/mystery and clarity criteria at first sight may appear to be opposite. However, the uncertainty implied by surprise is one about the nature of the challenge (what is its true valence?), while the certainty implied by clarity is one about the choice of action (how should I deal with this challenge?). These are not contradictory, as an uncertain challenge (e.g. a mysterious envelope left on your doorstep) may well incite a clear action (e.g. open the envelope to see what it contains). It is clear that in such a case the challenge will have a high priority even though its valence is as yet unknown: you are likely to immediately open the envelope, even though you may be disappointed to see that it contains merely some irrelevant publicity. " - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Each agent dealing with a challenge will normally extract some benefit from it, while reducing some components, and leaving some others invariant. If we focus only on the invariant components, we get a model of information transmission similar to the spreading of memes: messages are passed on from agent to agent, without undergoing much change, until they have reached everyone that may be interested in the message. This could for example be a model of the diffusion of a particular innovation, fashion, or scientific theory.
>
> If we focus on the variable components, we get a model of the self-organization of workflow and division of labor: different agents perform different tasks that are part of a common challenge, and then pass on the remaining challenge to others with different skills and/or needs, up to the point where nothing of value is left to extract, i.e. all tasks have been done. To better understand such distributed processing of a challenge we will need to investigate the dynamics of propagation from agent to agent." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "There are two paradigmatic cases of challenge propagation: stigmergy and propagation across a network. In the case of stigmergy, a challenge remains available in a public medium or workspace that all agents can access. If an agent decides to take on the challenge, it will perform some actions that change the state of the challenge and then leaves the modified challenge in the medium. At a later stage, some other agent may pick up the modified challenge, and perform some further work on it, again leaving the “traces” of its work in the medium—where it can function as a challenge for some further agent. Here, the changes in the challenge in a sense propagate in time, but not in space, as they always remain available in the same place. The medium either has a trivial topology (there is only one “place”), or its topology does not directly affect the propagation from agent to agent.
>
> The other paradigmatic case is a social or neural network, in which a challenge moves from agent to agent by following the available links in the network. Here, the topology of the network (which node is connected to which other nodes) fundamentally determines the propagation process: a challenge can move directly from agent A to agent B only if there exists a link A → B in the network. In the stigmergic case, the challenge can move from any agent X to any agent Y, without constraints. The only requirement is that Y should “visit” the shared medium some time after X deposited its modified challenge there. An Internet example of stigmergy is Wikipedia, where any person can modify any page at any stage independently of which other person has contributed to that page. An Internet example of networked propagation is email, where A can pass a challenge on to B only if A has B’s email address, and B has enough trust in A to take on challenges from A—which typically only happens if A and B have a social or organizational connection." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "As a general rule of thumb, the most interesting networks to explore will be those that are most similar in structure to the “natural” networks that we find in social networks, the Internet, or the brain. These all tend to have the following properties:
>
> - recurrent (links are directed but can form loops or cycles)
>
> - small-world (two arbitrary nodes tend to be separated by not more than a small number of links)
>
> - clustering (two neighbors of a node tend to be connected to each other)
>
> - power-law (many nodes with few links, few nodes with many links)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The connection strength of a (multi)link expresses the probability that a challenge will be successfully propagated across that link, i.e. that an agent in the output set would take up the challenge proposed by an agent in the input set. Link strength can be formalized most simply as the conditional probability P(B|A) that agent B would take on a challenge received from agent A.
>
> This probability can depend on different properties of the communicative connection between agents, including: trust (the degree to which the receiving agent takes challenges coming via the link from the sending agent seriously), power (the degree to which the sending agent can compel the sending agent to act), friendship (the degree to which the receiving agent is eager to do something for the sending agent independently of any power relationships), friction (the effort or energy that it costs to transmit the challenge across the link) and bandwidth (the detail and clarity with which information can be transmitted along the link). Link strength therefore may represent any and all of these properties." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "Note that the success of the crossing (i.e. whether the receiving agent effectively addresses the challenge) depends first of all on that agent itself, that is, its selection criteria for relevance, and its capabilities for processing the challenge. The link strength merely represents the social-communicative aspect of the process, namely the relationship between sending and receiving agent determining in how far the receiving agent is likely to pay attention to the other’s challenges. If the two agents have a very weak relationship (like in two agents who don’t know each other but who both have read the same Wikipedia page), the probability of one picking up a challenge left by the other is a priori very low, and will be determined almost exclusively by the properties of the challenge and of the agents rather than by their relationship. However, this low probability may be compensated by the fact that the multilink connects a very large number of agents, so that at least one agent in the output set is likely to pick up the challenge." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "The intelligence of the network could then be equated with the speed of decrease in the average length for all challenge vectors present in the network: the more quickly the network can “relax” its various challenges, the smarter it is. This now allows us to compare many different variations of the model to see which ones exhibit most intelligence. Some obvious variations to investigate are:
>
> - different criteria used by the agents to select which challenges to address
>
> - different cognitive architectures (e.g. production rules or neural networks) for the agents
>
> - different hypergraph topologies (e.g. stigmergy vs. binary graphs)
>
> - different network topologies (e.g. hierarchical, clustering, power-law, etc.)
>
> - different rules for propagating the challenges across the links
>
> - different learning rules for changing the link weights in the network" - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

> "While the development of such a model will still require a lot of research, the present analysis makes the problem much more tractable, by subdividing it into separate elements (such as challenge, agent and multilink), structures (such as topology of the network, or organization of the agents), processes (such as challenge selection, challenge processing, and challenge propagation), and measures (such as degree of relaxation, priority of a challenge, and overall intelligence)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen]()

https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/why-we-need-a-new-religion

> "Rather than being dictated top down, we can only hope that the religion of tomorrow will emerge and evolve bottom up. Religion seems to be very much like language, and we’ve seen plenty of failed top-down invented “better” languages as well as religions." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "It’s easy to discard “religion” altogether when it is understood merely as superstitious adherence to conventions of a holy book, as the “new atheists” have shown. Yes, an all-powerful, all-benevolent creator reigning from the heavens does seem like a childish projection of a father figure. Shitting on SkyDaddy may be fun and allow detached analytical types to feel superior, but it’s cheap to dunk on a strawman." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "A more interesting framing of religion is to view it as the fabric that ties society together. And what tied traditional societies of a distant past together obviously won’t be able to take on that role today. However, weaving this shared social fabric of religion may be the only way we know of to organise society past the Dunbar number. A broader definition of religion would also include our stories about technology, art, nation states, etc. Geertz defines religion as a “system of symbols which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in society”.
>
> Any widely shared beliefs, stories, and practices could be conceived of as religious in this broader definition that we are considering here. From trust in the institution of science to the story of progress through globalisation to the ritual of accepting printed paper for goods - it’s all religious in this broader framing.
>
> Layman Pascal proposes that religion is fundamentally about the harmonisation and integration of culture, technology, politics, etc. at a given time and place. If this religious integration is successful, it results in an excess of meaning and coherence that can translate into a numinous experience that binds communities together. From this point of view, religion stops seeming like an antiquated mode of superstition. Rather, the emergence of a religion that creates a right integration and surplus coherence for our times suddenly seems like an urgent priority.
>
> Old Friedrich declared the death of God more than 140 years ago. And the damn corps has been rotting for so long that we can no longer ignore the stench. As social animals that relate to the world and each other through justifications, it seems like we need a narrative that gives purpose to our lives. Yet more and more find it impossible to believe the silly dogmas of the cultural fossils we generally call “religion”, or to participate in their dead rituals. This is neither an apology for ancient superstitions nor an attempt to resurrect Skydaddy, but we have to admit that there is a gaping hole that these relics used to fill for our ancestors.
>
> Alexander Bard asserts that we are inherently tribal and religious and that our reaching for a unifying mythos is non-negotiable, even automatic. Even if God is dead, we can’t help but create a new one, even if unconsciously.
>
> > Modern society was never atheist, it just pushed its pantheon into the unconscious, glossed it over with science, money, and status - subconsciously worshipping Gucci God and Mammon.
>
> Some might argue that Capital has become our new God - a delicious throwback to the biblical golden calf. A more encompassing diagnosis would be that we ourselves have taken on the role of God in the advent of humanism. Anthropos on the throne, Mammon (Capital & markets) to his right, and Scientia to her left. Seems fitting, since humans are now literally the force shaping our planet (Anthropocene, etc.). Homo Deus wields weapons many orders of magnitude more powerful than what the Gods of old could dream of. Little Boy makes Thor’s hammer and Zeus’ lightning look like Nerf guns. Armageddon is just an autocrat with a big red button away.
>
> As Daniel Schmachtenberger diagnosed astutely, a civilization with godly power but lacking in wisdom will self-terminate inexorably. And even if we don’t blow ourselves up, we will eventually degrade the very substrate we depend on in our mindless strive for (economic) growth and progress, as mandated by the archangels of consumerist humanism.
>
> Our unconscious global religion not only fails to put us in right relationship with each other and the planet, but it also can’t answer our call for meaning. We are left trapped in a state of the Absurd - feeling atomized, alienated, and nihilistic." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "The religion of tomorrow needs to resolve these existential issues and falls short if it does not address these coordination failures at the root cause. Because all of these issues are global in nature, we need a religion of global scope. Returning humans to their proper place as the nervous system of Gaia instead of cancer eating away at the very substrate that sustains it. " - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "In addition to these “objective” crises, we are facing a “subjective” crisis of meaning. From Marx to Byung-Chul Han, the persistent alienation and atomization of “modern man” has been diagnosed to death without being able to shift us out of the predicament. Whether we call it “left brain chauvinism” (McGilchrist etc.) or the “tyranny of the propositional” (Vervaeke), there seems to be something off at the very core of our culture. Vervaeke’s work is probably the most complete in outlining an actual solution: The process of relevance realization, if liberated from parasitic processing, can return us to a multi-modal connectedness to the world around us and one another. All [4 kinds of knowing](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202101/john-vervaeke-s-brilliant-4p3r-metatheory-cognition#:~:text=With%20his%204P%20model%2C%20he,procedural%3B%20and%204)%20propositional.) need to be honed in ecologies of practices to afford an “optimal grip” on reality characterized by flow and insight cascades." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "Metamodern Religion needs to provide ecologies of practices that can return us to the right relationship with each other and the world and protect us from intersubjective parasites.
>
> Together with the external crisis described above, we can then conclude that Metamodern Religion faces the Herculean task of resolving both the Meta Crisis and the Meaning Crisis. I think a genuine religion of our time would resolve our most pressing issues both internally and externally.
>
> In summary, we note the following requirements for Metamodern Religion:
>
> 1. It needs to provide a sense of personal and shared meaning. This includes moral and ontological frameworks that provide orientation in the world.
>
> 2. Its narratives should be able to tie into previous religious views while updating them with our latest scientific understandings. The unifying narrative should allow for significantly different interpretations, practices, and ways of living without losing coherence and fragmenting into competing sects.
>
> 3. Existential risk needs to be directly addressed, from climate catastrophe and ecocide to nuclear proliferation and the dangers of rogue AI. Ideally, it would address the “generator function” of these issues, resolving all classes of coordination failures such as multipolar traps and the tragedy of the commons.
>
> 4. Psycho-technologies and ecologies of practice need to be built in to allow for personal and collective transformation. We will likely need a large portfolio of techniques that is applied selectively depending on cultural and personal circumstances.
>
> 5. Last but not least, it should prevent the failure modes of previous religions, including weaponization for controlling the population and petrification into outdated dogma." - [Why we need a new religion, by Octopusyarn]()

> "The task at hand is to decidedly reject the toxic tendencies of religions (dogma and institutionalized power structures) while exapting their social functions in a way that works for a specific time and place." - [The anatomy of religions, by Octopusyarn]()

> "New atheists didn’t get Chesterton’s fence. They missed how important religion is for social cohesion and a sense of meaning. This is ironic, given Dawkins’ work on Memetics is explicitly about the adaptive fitness of ideas." - [Redeeming Christian concepts, by Octopusyarn]()

> "It makes sense to think of the Devil as a transpersonal being, an egregore. Evil, in turn, is a relational process that creates suffering, not a fixed characteristic. The Devil rises from social conditions that foster Evil." - [Redeeming Christian concepts, by Octopusyarn]()

> "What would religion be without a concept of God? Even though it's arguable the term may carry too much historical baggage, it seems an equivalent concept as a pointer of ultimate value is critical for the overall function of the system." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "God emerges from an ever-evolving, interconnected net of relations." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "Traditionally religious speculations have already been coming back as hypotheses wrapped in “science-y” language for the past decades already (see the demarcation problem). The simulation hypothesis is just tech bro gnosticism. The Omega point and the singularity are Silicon Valley eschatology. Cosmological inflation, complexification, quantum entanglement, many worlds. Many words. And all of them have religious implications and offer competing grand narratives, whether their pundits admit it or not. Many of them tie in with great religious traditions and philosophers alike (Hegel, Whitehead, Bergson, de Chardin). A re-integration therefore does not seem out of reach, and we will continue to see more convincing attempts. The prototypical example is Wilber’s Integralism, and more recently, Metamodernism. Interesting attempts that focus even more on the narrative aspects continue to show up, e.g. Emergentism or The Romance of Reality.
>
> While the vanguard of science is still undecided on major questions (e.g. interpretations of quantum mechanics or the nature of consciousness) and different narrative strands will end up with quite different interpretations, some common elements seem clear. First and foremost, a development through time with distinct phase changes of emergence with increasing complexity seems like a common denominator. " - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "Being self-aware of its constructedness, a metamodern God concept needs to be able to sustain critique. Daniel Görtz describes this concept of a headless God as follows: “It is a God whose altar can be pissed upon, is insulted again and again, yet remains sacred, is resurrected. (...) Always on its way to the guillotine.” This allows for an anti- fragile dynamic where whatever belief structures are left after ferocious critique can be believed in with much more conviction. This constant critique also acts as a pruning function to get rid of structures no longer needed. Since our God is anti- fragile, there should be no hesitation in tearing down any narratives that are disproven by our scientific advances and reconstructing ones that better reflect reality." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "This ain’t no fun as a single-player game; Metamodern Religion only comes to life with a collective of believers. Self-aware narrativity is also how we might hope that an increasing number of people will resonate with the stories we come up with: Any valid critique and additions that are useful while being coherent should be included without hesitation. As time progresses, the petrified dogmas of traditional religions will become ever more inconsistent. All the while, the population on average develops further and Metamodern Religion will exert an inexorable pull on adherents of traditional religions. At the same time, more scientific minded people would notice that the stories are in agreement with their worldview but provide much more personal and collective meaningfulness, so they too would be tempted to join in. Filling the God-shaped hole in our hearts in a way that doesn’t compromise on rationality is somewhat of a no-brainer.
>
> Metamodern religion will only feel intersubjectively real once a critical mass of “believers” subscribe to it. Just because we know that it’s just a story we made up doesn’t make it feel any less real. Even more so, we can believe it because we know we made it up. There is a certain bootstrapping principle at play here that reminds of Alexander Bard’s Syntheos, the created God, and the concept of Hyperstition. Like a collective placebo effect, we might be surprised how real our headless God will feel once enough of us have agreed on a version we could believe in." - [A Headless God or religion for our times, by Octopusyarn]()

> "How could such a convoluted structure possibly scale to a global religion? The answer is that not everybody has to understand it, they just need to participate in it. I can type these words without knowing how my laptop works. It is much easier to function within a given system than work on the systemic level itself. Only a small part of the population will be called to do the latter and both help Metamodern Religion emerge in the first place and then improve and maintain it. Whoever is called to this work will likely have a certain temperament and a certain level of development in specific areas. Whatever personality typology or developmental frameworks we might apply here, the conclusion will always be that it’s a rather small part of the population. Only these “shamanoid” personalities (as [Bard calls them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9gYpj0WLcg)) would need to understand the functioning of the structure as a whole and likely undergo significant training to take up their role as stewards or “priests” of Metamodern Religion." - [Cosmo-local coordination, by Octopusyarn](https://octopusyarn.substack.com/p/cosmo-local-coordination)

> "What a treat to be thinking about how to address societies’ biggest problems with a complex system of interlocking holons that have a transformative impact across ontologies to solve global coordination, install new universal values, guide behavior, and create a fractal stack of personal meaning. Right? A new global religion is emerging, and we’re early to the party.
>
> The exciting thing is that all of these aspects mapped to the different spheres are coming into being. Now. The galaxy brains linked throughout this text are busy tackling different aspects and are gathering communities and resources around themselves. Powerful psycho-technologies from yoga to meditation and psychedelics are entering the mainstream. More beautiful (and truthful) narratives than the old “infected monkeys on a small speck of dust lost in an infinity of empty space” are gaining hold. The AI community has realized that human alignment is the true alignment problem.

Computer scientist Viktoras Veitas and philosopher David Weinbaum recently proposed a futuristic evolutionary paradigm, the ‘World of Views’, which may be useful to help us situate an exploration of the technocultural world. The ‘World of Views’ attempts to understand a post- scarcity, post-singularity, evolutionary landscape where the primary driver of change is the “multiplicity of unique, modular, and open co-evolving worldviews” (Veitas & Weinbaum 2015, p. 504)
