TOK 101 - Justification Systems Theory
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoIGnQI6aAQ


> "• Justification refers to the reasons we give to legitimize our claims and actions.
>
> • Rationalizations and analytic explanations that are accurate are both justifications.
>
> • The process of justifying was the central process that transformed us from primates into persons.
>
> ... justifications are the reasons we give for doing things. They are also the reasons we have for believing things, and justifying is the process by which we try to get other people to see our reasons for our claims and actions.
>
> ... Epistemology is a term in philosophy that refers to how we know and what we deem to be true knowledge... processes of justification emerge when human language gets organized into propositions. The reason is that propositions set the stage for questions about the extent to which they are justifiable. This generates a "question-answer dynamic" that builds systems of justification.
>
> ... Ontology refers to what is real or one’s theory of reality... UTOK gives us a new perspective on justification. In addition to noting the epistemological aspects of justification, UTOK allows us to see clearly the ontology of justification systems. That is, UTOK's "Justification Systems Theory" frames justification processes and systems as real things in the world. In fact, justification processes and systems are the glue that binds together what UTOK identifies as the “Culture-Person” plane of existence. That is, our propositional knowledge is bound together, structurally and functionally, by systems and processes of justification. And, as children, we are socialized to become fully functioning adult persons by learning what is and what is not justifiable in our culture, community, and family." - [Is Justification the Most Important Word in Human Language? by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202310/is-justification-the-most-important-word-in-human-language)



> "Justification systems are the interlocking network of propositions that create a shared sense of understanding what is and what ought to be... Your self-conscious justifications for who you are and why you do what you do live in an intersubjective, cultural space. That is, you learned to talk in an intersubjective field, and words and sentences flow through the skin and into the world of cultured persons and back again without losing their form. While another cannot directly see your subject conscious experience, you can directly share the propositional thoughts you have about your experience with others.
>
> As you grew up, you were socialized into a network of justification systems that existed prior to you and at different levels of social organization. There was a macro-level that framed the key assumptions, values, and narrative arc of your culture at large. These are the broadest level of justification systems and represent the superstructure that frames the worldview that functions to provide shared reasons for the governance and values of the society in which you were raised. There were also intermediate, meso-level justification systems that framed and coordinated the structure of the groups, institutions, and communities in which you lived. Finally, there were the micro-level justification systems that framed the rules and roles of your family and immediate relationships. These nested, socially constructed justification systems make up what UTOK calls the Culture-Person plane of existence." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)


> "Propositional language spawned “question-answer dynamics,” which is the generative conversational processes by which humans construct systems of justification. Systems of justification are networks of propositions that afford explicit sense-making and coordinate populations of people in a shared cultural story and understanding for what is legitimate.
>
> Justification systems evolve over time. In the Western tradition, we can locate the Greek trio of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as being a transition into a more refined system of justification that we call Western philosophy. More specifically, the Socratic method represents a sophisticated form of questioning that reveals the arbitrariness of much of what constitutes the social construction of reality. Plato and Aristotle both attempted to develop refined philosophical systems that could be justified in the light of a Socratic reflection.
>
> The ToK System depicts science emerging out of the Culture-Person plane... Following the trail from the Greeks into Western Europe approximately 500 years ago, it grows as a justification system designed to identify and control for subjective and social biases and build explanatory networks that factor out the human knower as much as possible to leave behind more objective descriptions of the unfolding wave of behavior. We can also place the postmodern critique in this evolution of justification systems." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)


> "UTOK frames the intersubjective knowledge vector as consisting of the shared systems of justification that coordinate people and yoke together both what is and what ought to be. It also characterizes the Culture-Person plane of existence as being organized by large-scale systems of justification. These systems of justification emerge in socio-historical contexts and operate at different levels of scope and abstraction. A family has a justification system that operates at the direct interpersonal level. The law can be considered a set of formalized justifications backed by institutional power to legitimize the social control of conduct deemed illegitimate (i.e., illegal). At the most abstract and highest level of Culture, there resides a superstructure that organizes these large-scale systems of justification that consist of the worldviews, central narratives, foundational ideas, and core values and assumptions that function to structure and organize the meaning making processes for that group.
>
> Intersubjective knowledge is different from both the subjective knowledge privately experienced by a particular human and the objective knowledge generated by science. Although the latter is a kind of intersubjective knowledge, it is both restricted and generative of a new kind of knowing by its primary reliance on epistemic values of accuracy, quantitative methodology, and the focus on developing good explanations of what is the case, independent of what is subjectively experienced or what ethically ought to be. Placed in categories given to us by Greek rhetoric, we can say that MENS (modern empirical natural sciences) knowledge, framed by the ToK System, is grounded in logos and seeks to build accurate or true models of the world. In contrast, subjective knowledge, framed by the iQuad Coin, is grounded in pathos and is guided by experience and the feelings of being in the real world. Finally, the intersubjective collective is grounded in mythos, which unites the individual and the group in a shared narrative of both what is and what ought to be...
>
> The Bible provides a justificatory superstructure for cultures, nations, and communities that are part of the Abrahamic traditions. Genesis tells the story of human origin and our relationship to the infinite, temptation, sin, and potential for suffering and fulfillment...
>
> ... a central task of society is to develop a MEmeplex (i.e., a superstructure of justification) that places, in right relation, both metaphysics and empiricism, as well as the needs and perspectives of individuals and relative to the larger group." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)


> "Justification Systems Theory (JUST) ... unlocks the mystery of the emergent evolutionary forces that gave rise to the Culture dimension of complexification and our transition from primates to self-conscious persons. It also affords us a way to see the ontology of epistemological processes, thus providing key insights for philosophy. And, by cleaving the joint point between animal mindedness and cultured persons, JUST set the stage for the ToK System as a new, descriptive metaphysical map of the cosmos and our place within it.
>
> In everyday language, the word “justification” refers to the reasons we give others for our actions or claims. For example, a person might justify the reason they were late to a meeting by saying that they ran into traffic. If the person were late for other reasons that he wanted to hide, we might say he used the traffic to justify his tardiness. Here, the meaning of justify aligns with what Freud meant by rationalize. Rationalizing captures the “Freudian pole” of the dimension of justification, and it refers to how we use reasons to hide true meaning and persuade self and others of more palatable truths. However, there is another meaning of justification that is almost the exact opposite. Plato generated a formulation of knowledge called “justified true belief” that dominated epistemology for thousands of years. Here, justified means legitimate in the sense of being true, accurate, or valid. For example, we can say that modern physicists are justified in believing in Einstein’s general theory of relativity because it has been confirmed by so many experiments.
>
> A key feature of JUST is that it highlights how the concept of justification can legitimately reference the full dimension of reason-giving that stretches from Freudian rationalizing to Plato’s analysis of epistemology. Most philosophical systems focus on separating analytically justified claims from motivated rationalizations, and trying to build systems on the former. Although this is, of course, important to do, UTOK’s JUST gives us a new angle to approach how humans construct systems of knowledge. Specifically, it allows us to see the ontology of epistemology and rationalizations more generally on the dimension of justification. This becomes especially clear via the way it frames the Culture-Person plane of existence on the ToK System and the domain of Mind3 on the Map of Mind as justification systems.
>
> According to JUST, it was the question-answer dynamics that emerged in the wake of propositional language that ultimately led to our transition from primates to persons. A proposition makes a positive meaning claim. The statement, “There are the antelope,” means that a particular kind of creature resides in a specific place and time. In making this assertion, we can note that it opens “negative” claim space around it. This is the domain of counterfactual space, and relates to the veracity of the claim (i.e., “Those are not antelope but gazelle” or “They are not there, but here,” and so forth). Interestingly, there is also negative value space. This is because the statement focuses the attention of the speaker and the listener(s) on the claim and its implications. At issue here are considerations of investment and influence for the individual and group. Consider the response, “Yes, but there are rabbits in the brush, and we should hunt them instead.”
>
> According to JUST, the emergence of propositional speech was intimately tied to the rise of the capacity to question the validity of such propositions. In UTOK, this is called the question-answer dynamic. By “answer,” I mean affirmative claims or propositions that confer meaning and orient toward truth and value claims. By “question,” I mean queries that function to do things such as elicit propositional knowledge (e.g., What is going on here?) or challenge existing claims (e.g., Why do you believe that? What values are guiding you?) or highlight the lack of knowledge (e.g., Why did you do this?). The result of the question-answer dynamic is the problem of justification, which is the problem of developing shared networks of beliefs and values that coordinate, regulate, and legitimize action.
>
> By attending to the dynamic relationship between questions and answers, JUST recasts the basic unit of linguistic meaning—usually characterized as a proposition—as a justification. The justification for doing so is that, functionally, propositions operate in the world as justifications that serve to make truth and value claims and legitimize them. To help make this transition from propositions to justifications, it is central to keep in mind that any proposition given in the social context can be questioned by self or others regarding, among other things, its (a) logical or empirical content; (b) purpose the individual has for emphasizing that proposition at that moment; and (c) implications for what ought to happen for the individual or group, given the claim being made.
>
> These three domains align with the three aspects of the problem of justification, which are as follows: 1) the analytic or truth or accuracy aspect; 2) the personal value aspect; and 3) the social value aspect. The analytic aspect refers to truth and can be thought of as stretching from basic accuracy (i.e., does the statement accurately correspond to the state of affairs?) to deeper truth claims about the nature of existence and the epistemological validity for the assertion. The personal aspect refers to how the justification impacts the individual and his or her interests and patterns of investment. Consider, in the example, that person A is excellent at hunting antelope, and person B is excellent at catching rabbits. Focusing on antelope versus rabbits is potentially better for A than B. The social aspect refers to the fact that public justifications live in the interpersonal space between people and function to coordinate the group. In this case, the group would need to decide if they would hunt the antelope, the rabbits, or split up and do both separately.
>
> With this background, we can move into the formal structure of JUST. It consists of the following three interlocking claims: 1) the evolution of propositional language generated question-answer dynamics and the adaptive problem of justification, which, in turn, shaped both the evolution of human self-consciousness and human culture such that; 2) the nature of human consciousness can be framed by UTOK’s ESP-A (Ego-Self-Persona-Awareness) Updated Tripartite Model, and the dynamics of the private ego and public persona are well framed by the problem of justification, either privately to one’s self or publicly to real or imagined others; and 3) processes of justification gave rise to the emergence of Culture with a capital “C,” which are the large-scale systems of justification that coordinate the behaviors of persons.
>
> Why does the emergence of propositional speech and questioning result in an evolutionary tipping point? One crucial reason is that asking questions is, cognitively speaking, relatively easy. To see why this is the case, spend some time with a curious four-year-old. They are likely to pepper you with questions, such as “Why don’t we eat cookies before we eat dinner?”; “Why are you bald?”; “Why is the sky blue?” As precocious children can readily demonstrate, asking questions is much easier than answering them. That is why exasperated parents eventually say, “That’s just the way it is!” This observation suggests that the capacity to ask questions necessarily motivated the search for relevant, legitimizing answers. The answers that emerge as shared beliefs become the defining feature of human culture. Culture with a capital “C” is the network of claims, narratives, ideologies, and laws that have developed in response to such dialogical processes of justification." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

> "... as the shift in the last two decades away from formal news organizations makes clear, society can change dramatically. This brings us to the processes of justification, which operate in micro-relational contexts between people, but also function to structure macro-level societal operations and regulate patterns of human behavioral investment in societal institutional and economic contexts." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)


> "**Justification**: Refers first to conventional usage relating to legitimizing claims, but it expands in UTOK to characterize virtually all propositional statements, each of which can be thought of as a statement of justification that does or does not carry legitimacy, depending on the social position. Justifications carry both truth and value claims that can be potentially challenged in the social context of justification that they are offered. And they are networked into justification systems that coordinate people and legitimize action. In UTOK, justification is seen as both the central driving selective force on the Culture-Person plane of existence and as a central concept in epistemology, where justification is the relationship between belief and the truth). It also has a “strange loop” aspect, as in: this definition justifies my definition of justification, which gives the term a fluid and dynamic meaning.
>
> **Justification Hypothesis**: Refers to a key aspect of Justification Systems Theory, which is the claim that there was a tipping point in the evolution of language, such the emergence of propositions was closely tied to the emergence of questions, and together they created a tipping point that generated a complexity building feedback loop that led both to the evolution of the human ego as the mental organ of justification and to the emergence of the Culture-Person plane of existence.
>
> **Justification Systems Theory**: The metatheoretical joint point that frames the evolution of the Culture-Person plane of existence on the ToK System. It consists of three different elements. First there is the Justification Hypothesis, which is the idea that propositional language generated question-answer dynamics and the problem of justification, and this drove the evolution of the human ego and the Culture Person plane of existence. The second aspect of JUST is the ESP-A Updated Tripartite Model of Human Consciousness, which clarifies the relationships between pure awareness, the core experiential self, the ego, and the persona and the filtration dynamics therein. The third aspect is the claim that we can separate out capital Culture and frame it as the emergence and evolution of large-scale systems of justification, which provides an ontological analysis of epistemological processes, as well as frames the sociocultural construction of reality as propositional belief-value networks that function to legitimize what is and what ought to be." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)



> "The Justification System. This system is the seat of verbally mediated thought and symbolic reasoning. It is structurally and functionally organized as propositional networks that an individual uses to determine which claims and actions are legitimate and which are not. It also enables individuals to give reasons for behavior, and at its highest level of abstraction and organization it represents the person’s worldview. Although individuals can learn how to engage in analytic reasoning via the justification system, the formulation provided by the UTOK model is that the justification system is first and foremost a motivated reasoning system, one that is guided by (although not necessarily dictated by) nonverbal drives, goals, and intuitive frames, and is functionally organized as a reason-giving system, rather than a purely analytical reasoning system." - [UTOK: The Unified Theory of Knowledge, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219729081-utok)

This is a factor in holding back progress in our understanding of both the nature of humanity and the future of humanity." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As a general principle, the more faithfully a society can store and transmit cultural information between cultural beings and across cultural generations, the less functional cultural information is lost (i.e. ‘backward slippage’), and the easier it becomes for any given cultural collective to build upon the complexity of inherited cultural knowledge (i.e. ‘ratcheting’). In this sense, the speed of cultural change is a rough function of the qualitative efficiency and quantitative number of conversations (i.e. idea sharing/sex) being conducted within and between individuals and populations." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "There is a struggle of ideas, theories and worldviews within the symbolic order, but this struggle is an increasingly conscious struggle for the universality of the symbolic order itself.

“Once you learn to discern the voice of Mother Culture humming in the background, telling her story over and over again to the people of your cult­ure, you’ll never stop being conscious of it. Wherever you go for the rest of your life, you’ll be tempted to say to the people around you, ‘how can you listen to this stuff and not recognize it for what it is?’”

> "I will use a definition that fits with our evolutionary framework, but is similar in spirit to a widely used definition from the anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson: 'Culture is an emergent characteristic of a group of agents and is determined by the agents’ rules of behavior (or norms) for acting in their social environment and for interacting with each other. Cultural rules are socially transmitted and learned.' Cultural norms are in short the rules of thumb for behaving in a social environment. Norms are “should” or “ought” statements about what is considered the right, appropriate, or the expected thing to do, by the society or organization in a given situation." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)

> "40. This definition is narrower, but sympathetic with Boyd and Richerson’s (1985), p. 2, definition: “By ‘culture’ we mean the transmission from one generation to the next, via teaching, and imitation of knowledge, values, and other factors that influence behavior.” The key differences in my definition are the emergent character of culture and the focus on the cognitive rules that translate knowledge and values into behaviors rather than the knowledge and values per se. Finally, my interest is not all behaviors, but the subset of social behaviors. The key compatibilities are a view that culture is expressed through behavior, is socially learned, and is both vertically (e.g., through parents and superiors in a hierarchy) and horizontally (e.g., peers) transmitted." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

Of course, learners may place more weight on domains that for one reason or other seem more causally relevant to the model’s success. This copying often includes the model’s personal habits or styles as well as their goals and motivations, since these may be linked to their success. This “if in doubt, copy it” heuristic is one of the reasons why success in one domain converts to influence across a broad range of domains.

>
> - Human culture includes language, artifacts, music, stories, rituals, behaviors, and other information stored inside and outside of human brains.
>
> - Humans acquire culture through social learning. There are two major pathways of transmission: vertical, from parents to children only, or horizontal, between unrelated people. The mode of transmission is itself a major selective factor, shaping the content of culture.
>
> - Culture cannot survive and reproduce itself without humans; humans, after long dependence on culture, can no longer survive and reproduce themselves without it.
>
> - Cultures vary and change, and experience differential “reproductive” success: they spread or fail to spread, and their host populations grow or shrink.
>
> - Biological organisms only change by selection on random mutations. Culture, on the other hand, varies in part through intentional (non-random) human action. Despite this, it is rarely the case that humans fully understand all the functions of their culture, or predict how any changes they make will affect them and their descendants.

> "Innovations are instead an emergent property of our species’ cultural learning abilities, applied within our societies and social networks. Our societies and social networks act as collective brains. We outline how many human brains, which evolved primarily for the acquisition of culture, together beget a collective brain. Within these collective brains, the three main sources of innovation are serendipity, recombination and incremental improvement. We argue that rates of innovation are heavily influenced by (i) sociality, (ii) transmission fidelity, and (iii) cultural variance. We discuss some of the forces that affect these factors. These factors can also shape each other." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

Under some circumstances, this can lead to oblique learning and selective biases to distinguish who to learn from—the human pathway to truly cultural brains." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Human brains have evolved with an ability and proclivity for selective, high fidelity social learning. In a world of imperfect cues for the adaptive value of culture, there are a variety of strategies and biases that have evolved to hone in on the most adaptive knowledge. These strategies and biases include direct and indirect cues of the popularity of cultural traits (e.g. conformist transmission bias), direct and indirect cues that a potential model has adaptive know-how worth learning (e.g. success and prestige biases), filtering mechanisms to assess the accuracy of information and sincerity of models (e.g. credibility enhancing displays), personal relevance of culture and biases toward certain content (e.g. dangerous animals, the edibility of plants, fire and gossip)." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Like the neural networks of the biological brain, the social networks of the collective brain have underlying structures. Collective brains differ in many ways: size, interconnectivity, network properties, social groupings and so on. As cross-cultural research reveals, collective brains also differ in the psychology of their constituent cultural brains. For example, some societies have a higher level of xenophobia with potential implications for the inflow of ideas from outgroups. Societies also differ in ‘tightness’ and ‘looseness’—their openness to divergent ideas—with consequent effects for cultural variance." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "At an individual level, a collective brain perspective suggests that individual innovation benefits from exposure to a wide array of ideas, beliefs, values, mental models and so on. This is part of what creates a ‘prepared mind’. Einstein, for example, was exposed to many ideas working at a patent office. Much of his work related to evaluating patents on electrical devices, including those related to the synchronization of time, which made later appearances in his thought experiments. Einstein cultivated a wide network, regularly travelling and forming friendships with the leading scientists of his day. At the level of the collective brain, there are many factors that affect the overall rate of innovation and diffusion." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

^^ we need to make as much knowledge common - private knowledge is a symptom of misalignment and slows everyone down

> "Economists typically assume material incentives drive innovators and thus innovations. However, from our point of view, recombination and incremental improvements are critical to innovation and patents can also stifle these processes by inhibiting the flow of information across individual minds, instead incentivizing secrecy. Consistent with this, historical analyses of patent laws by Moser and recent analyses of human gene patents by Williams both suggest that patent laws may often be too strong, reducing innovation, but this does not mean no patents would lead to more innovation. Based on data on pharmaceutical patents in 92 countries from 1978 to 1992, Qian argues that there may be an optimal level of protection, after which innovation is stifled. Increasing innovation is about empowering the collective brain." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Reducing the costs of failure by creating a safety net can influence innovation via multiple channels, including by allowing individuals to invest in broader social ties (expanding the collective brain) over kin ties and by increasing entrepreneurship directly. This relationship is supported by analyses of England’s old poor law, more forgiving bankruptcy laws across 15 countries, unemployment insurance in France and in the USA, the introduction of food stamps, health insurance for children and access to health insurance unbundled from employment, all of which increased entrepreneurship. Of course, there is an optimal amount of social insurance vis-à-vis innovation, because increased funding of such programmes can increase tax burdens—some data suggest that higher corporate taxes can lead to lower entrepreneurship. Overall, social safety nets energize innovation because they permit individuals to interconnect in broader, richer, networks." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although we have discussed sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance separately, they are interrelated. For example, sociality may have little effect if a task is too simple and therefore, transmission fidelity is very high or individual learning dominates solutions. Similarly, theoretical and experimental research with social network structures suggests that too much interconnectivity can decrease variance. The trade-off is between interconnectivity increasing the probability of useful recombinations in the incredibly high dimensional space of cultural combinations and the reductions in variance caused by our selective biases applying to large portions of the population. These results and the collective brain perspective suggest an optimal amount of interconnectivity. However, because real societal networks are far less dense than laboratory networks and we are far from a completely connected network, human society will probably continue to benefit from increases in interconnectivity (i.e. we are still on the positive slope). Moreover, variance is introduced by other factors, such as mistakes in transmission and individual differences in social learning and conformist biases (e.g. higher IQ individuals may be less conformist). Finally, the same principles that lead to larger populations possessing more complex technologies can also shape and hone the mechanisms of cultural transmission, such as pedagogy and language." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Changes in languages can dramatically improve the efficiency of collective brains, just as myelination can make neural pathways more efficient over ontogeny. There are many ways that cultural evolution can optimize or make languages more useful. These include larger vocabularies, bigger phonemic inventories, more grammatical tools and more learnable syntactic morphologies.. In the laboratory... artificial language transmission experiments reveal that over generations, these languages structurally change to become more learnable." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "In addition to language, cultural evolution may also be tuning the structures of the collective brain and the factors that affect sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance. This tuning may offset a problem Mesoudi discusses, whereby as cultural complexity increases, it is more difficult for each generation to acquire the growing and more complex body of adaptive knowledge. Consistent with this tuning, large-scale societies, with more complex technologies, engage in more teaching than small-scale societies, thereby increasing transmission fidelity as cultural complexity increases. There is also some evidence for increases in division of labour (increased specialization), with more international trade and more domestic outsourcing of tasks (i.e. less vertical integration of all aspects of a business). Despite these increases in pedagogy and specialization, our ‘extended juvenile period’ has become further extended with delayed age of first child and longer formal education. Finally, Americans continue to expand their vocabularies across their adult lives, which has expanded the difference in the verbal IQs between adolescents and their parents relative to prior generations, where vocabularies expanded little after the mid-twenties." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Sociality, transmission fidelity and transmission variance all vary across populations and are subject to cultural evolution along a variety of dimensions. Over time, higher intergroup competition may favour institutions, such as social safety nets, that generate innovations. These factors affect the many ways in which innovations arise, such as exposure to more ideas (via cultural models prior to mass communication technologies), mistakes in transmission and serendipity through fiddling around. If these processes are the primary mechanisms through which innovations arise, then it would help explain the prevalence of Newton –Liebniz and Darwin–Wallace-type controversies. Yet, in a population of millions, it was only Newton and Liebniz who discovered calculus, only Darwin and Wallace who developed the theory of evolution by natural selection; only a handful of people who actually invented each technology. Does the collective brain really relegate the specific innovator to a fungible node at a nexus in the social network? Do cognitive abilities, like IQ or executive function, really play no part?" - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Collective brains make their constituent cultural brains more cognitively skilled in surviving in the local environment and better able to solve novel problems, using a larger repertoire of accumulated abilities. Intelligence is often assumed to underlie both individual and population differences in creativity and innovation. While, in principle, intelligence may increase transmission fidelity, intelligence (as measured by IQ) is only weakly correlated with innovativeness (as measured by creativity), r = 0.20, and is at best a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. Based on the arguments outlined in §3a, we should expect that the collective brain can make cultural brains smarter through a combination of exposure to more ideas (sociality), better learning (transmission fidelity) and willingness to deviate (transmission variance). Of these three factors, exposure to more ideas is a necessary condition, because higher fidelity by itself would be associated only with incremental improvements and increased transmission variance by itself would be associated with more ideas, most of which would be bad." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "For a species so dependent on accumulated knowledge, not only is the idea of a ‘culture-free’ IQ test meaningless, but also the idea of ‘culture-free’ IQ. Our smarts are substantially culturally acquired in ways that alter both our brains and biology, and cannot meaningfully be measured or understood independent of culture." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Although some have argued for a causal relationship between IQ and development, the theory and evidence we have laid out so far suggest the opposite causal direction. Sociality (the size and interconnectedness of a population) leads to increased cultural complexity. Increased cultural complexity in turn smartens cultural brains by giving them access to a wider array of information, including physical, cognitive and linguistic tools, which may be recombined in new ways, generating new innovations. All of this is not to say that individual cognitive differences are unimportant to invention and innovation, only that these differences, like innovation, are an emergent property of the collective brain and that the focus on IQ, genius and other individual differences, as the source of innovation have missed the broader collective brain processes that explain within-group and between-group differences." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Educational psychology shows how learning some skills improve the acquisition of others. Exposure to Socratic questioning improves critical thinking more generally; learning the method of loci (attaching items to a physical location in memory) improves performance on memory tests; and exposure to the history of Darwin’s thought processes lead to a greater understanding of evolution. These may seem obvious, but demonstrate how exposure to new techniques and ideas can affect the acquisition of other techniques and ideas." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "The invention of these technologies also allows us to better understand the principles that underlie them—understanding the thermodynamics of a steam engine is a lot easier when you actually have a steam engine! We use our technologies as metaphors, analogies and concepts and they allow us to understand and innovate in ways we could not without such culture. The way in which ideas have shaped each other is a neglected aspect of cultural evolution, because it can be difficult to study." - [Innovation in the collective brain, by Michael Muthukrishna and Joseph Henrich](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192)

> "Cultural evolution: Culture refers to the knowledge, behavior and ideas that are transmitted “horizontally”, from individual to individual, or “vertically”, from parent to offspring. Genetic information, on the other hand, is transmitted only vertically. Therefore, different biological species cannot share or pool their genes. As a result, they tend to diverge as they evolve. Culture, in contrast, is exchanged and thus shared between individuals within and across groups. Therefore, the dynamics of cultural evolution tends to be more convergent than divergent: good ideas tend to spread from group to group. It is also much faster and more efcient than biological evolution." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

For example, in problem-solving activities participants may have a shared goal and shared action plans for pursuing that goal, and in communication they may simply share experience with one another linguistically. The big Vygotskian idea is that what makes human cognition different is not more individual brainpower, but rather the ability of humans to learn through other persons and their artifacts, and to collaborate with others in collective activities." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

They use or exploit others – by gathering information from them, manipulating them as social tools, coordinating actions with them for their own benefit – and often compete with them as well. Human children, on the other hand, often are concerned with sharing psychological states with others by providing them with helpful information, forming shared intentions and attention with them, and learning from demonstrations produced for their benefit. The emergence of these skills and motives for shared intentionality during human evolution did not create totally new cognitive skills. Rather, what it did was to take existing skills of, for example, gaze following, manipulative communication, group action, and social learning, and transform them into their collectively based counterparts of joint attention, cooperative communication, collaborative action, and instructed learning – cornerstones of cultural living. Shared intentionality is a small psychological difference that made a huge difference in human evolution in the way that humans conduct their lives." - [Shared intentionality, by Michael Tomasello and Malinda Carpenter](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Wiley-Blackwell/Tomasello_Shared_DevScience_2007_1554748.pdf)

The root of the metacrisis is an education crisis (Zak Stein)
also a legitimation & teacherly authority crisis - its not just a technological problem
Education is the autopoietic root of society - the way it propagates/maintains/reproduces itself



## Education is the Metacrisis

> "The Coming Planetary Paideia
>
> **Paideia** is a Greek term which ... has a range of connotations, but largely has to do with the raising of youth and the intergenerational transmission of virtues, knowledge, and skill. In ancient Athens, the creation and maintenance of a collective paideia was understood as an educational and cultural task taking place prior to the tasks of building a coherent polity. Education is prior to politics and thus prior to civilisation. Education—the praxis that is our paideia—is the “deep code” of both. Changes in the shape and nature of our collective paideia are more radical than, and ultimately the cause of, any and all political revolutions.
>
> ... there is no viable future for civilisation that does not include a radical change in the nature of our educational systems... school systems themselves need to be repurposed and redesigned. I suggest that each school building be transformed into an unprecedented institution that is some combination of a public library, museum, co-working centre, computer lab, and daycare. Funded to the hilt and staffed by citizen-teacher-scientists, these public and privately supported educational hubs would be the local centres of regionally decentralised pop-up classrooms, community organising, apprenticeship networks, and college and work preparation counselling. Giant schools built on the model of the factory at the turn of the last century can be gutted, remodelled, and reborn (metaphorically and literally) to create the meta-industrial one-room schoolhouses of the future. In this new form of public space dedicated to education, digital technologies will enable the formation of peer-to-peer networks of students and teachers of all ages, from all across the local region (or the world, digitally), all without coercion or compromise. What enables these safe and efficient hubs of self- organising educational configurations are fundamentally new kinds of educational technologies, which put almost unlimited knowledge in the palm of every person’s hand...
>
> Education is the Metacrisis
>
> There are a large number of crises drawing increasing amounts of public attention, such as the ecological, economic, immigration, geopolitical, and energy crises. But there is also an invisible crisis unfolding within our own minds and cultures that is getting much less attention. This is the metacrisis, which has to do with how humans understand themselves and the world. It is a generalised educational crisis involving a set of related psychological dynamics; systems and societies are in trouble, but it is the psyche—the human dimension—that is in the direst of straits... Welcome to the metacrisis... This can be made clear by differentiating out the following four aspects:
>
> **Sense-making crisis** (what is the case?): Confusion at the level of understanding the nature of the world. Everyday people and experts are struggling to say things that are true, unable to comprehend increasing complexity...
>
> **Capability crisis** (how can it be done?): Incapacity at the level of operating on the world intelligently. In all social positions and domains of work, individuals are increasingly unable to engage in problem-solving to the degree needed for continued social integration...
>
> **Legitimacy crisis** (who should do it?): Incoherence at the level of cultural agreements. Political and bureaucratic forms of power are failing to provide sufficiently convincing rationale and justification for trust in their continued authority...
>
> **Meaning crisis** (why do it?): Inauthenticity at the level of personal experience. Individuals from all walks of life are
questioning the purpose of their existence, the goodness of the world, and the value of ethics, beauty, and truth...
>
> ... The four aspects of the metacrisis are to be understood as needing to be addressed by necessity; they are essential to any coherent paideia. All four aspects are interconnected; you cannot answer one without also providing answers for the other three. Indeed, the failure of modern education has to do with its only answering two of the four aspects... societies require each new generation to be in a position to inherit the requisite capabilities, legitimacy, and meaning-making to continue the project of cooperative social life. This entails that societies have some large percentage of their adult members actively working to maintain sophisticated educational projects. Failing this, the intergenerational fabric of the social world begins to fray. At some point inadequate education results in an inability to fill essential institutional roles, provide motivating meanings, and secure political legitimacy.
>
> Most educational efforts are usually offering answers to only one of these questions. When there is mention of an educational crisis, it is usually in reference to ... capability. Public school STEM curricula were explicitly built to address the capability crisis, as this is the aspect that is legible according to the terms set by the guiding philosophy of human capital theory. According to this argument, the economy is seen as flagging because educational systems are failing. This is a crisis of job preparedness and “twenty-first century skills,” where the focus is on the ability of people to do the jobs that need doing in order for the social system to work.
>
> ... for nearly a century the major educational force has been the modern public schools themselves. These have been the largest educational initiatives in history, and can be understood as having been invented as a means for generating political legitimacy and instilling sense-making about the nature of the world for this end. Science and nationalism replaced religion and ethnocentrism, and the idea that a particular form of government is natural (i.e., good / best possible) was made fit for mass consumption through the pedagogy of mass schooling...
>
> ... an answer to one aspect of the metacrisis entails an answer to them all, even if this answer is not explicit. Imagine training a bunch of scientists while providing no sense of meaning for their lives. Or imagine giving people rich sources of meaning, but never teaching them to do math or operate any kind of machines or organisations. It should be clear that both of those scenarios have been tried (at least in part) during modernity, and the approach is self-defeating. Scientists living meaningless lives create monstrosities; deskilled people whose meanings are dictated to them become sheep-like. Piecemeal approaches that address only one aspect of the four-fold educational crisis are multiplying and pilling up, and many of them could be making things worse.
>
> Modern approaches to education have been exhausted. There are no longer any agreed-upon answers to the basic questions that have long been at the heart of intergenerational transmission. A postmodern confusion has set in, which cannot last because these questions about the social world cannot remain unanswered. We are in a time between worlds and it is disorienting. The resolution of the metacrisis (or arrival in the new world) appears almost unimaginable, because each of the four aspects of the metacrisis requires a resolution that is interintertwined within the resolution of all others. Sense-making aids meaning-making, which aids legitimacy, which helps build capability (and so on, in all directions and combinations). If there is not this kind of complex educational system—this coherent and comprehensive paideia—then eventually “things fall apart,” as the saying goes, and the centre of the social world cannot hold. In the evolutionary dynamics of complex systems there is a tendency for these systems to lose their centre of balance—this is a crisis. Something new needs to (and will) emerge all at once, as a fundamentally new kind life makes itself possible. Or the exhausted form of life will simply end—that’s is all She wrote (where She = Nature)." - [Education is the Metacrisis, by Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-is-the-metacrisis/)

## Education must make History Again

> "... educational innovation is one of the major catalysts of fundamental historical change. Other drivers of history, such as technology, warfare, and economics, presuppose and stem from educational realities. Humans make history when they make intentional changes to the dynamics of intergenerational transmission. This means literally changing how we “pass on” the knowledge, skills, and character traits that make possible the unfolding of what we call history... I suggest keeping an eye on things like socialization, enculturation, contexts of human development, dynamics of teaching and learning, and intergenerational transmission. This is all “education”—as I broadly construe it.
>
> Thinking this way about history allows me to say that, today, education is the meta-crisis. Education is the root of all more specific crises such as climate change, governance breakdowns, impending war, and social unrest. There is a hidden crisis that is giving rise to the many obvious crises: it is unfolding in our own minds, and within newly complex and problematic dynamics of intergenerational transmission.
>
> ... Our civilization is starting to mishandle the basic task of equipping the next generation with the requisite skills, personality structures, and cultural resources needed to maintain essential social systems. This is what might be called “social autopoiesis”—the self-(re)creation of the social body—and it can only be accomplished through intentional practices of education.
>
> ... Education as a Driver of Historical Change
>
> ... It is not “as if” we are in a time between worlds; we are quite literally in such a time. It is possible to see within history periods of time that mark transitions between world-systems; times when the deep structures and codes of civilization itself are in flux... There have been historical moments in which education and educational thinking have fundamentally implicated world historical transformations. Education becomes a radically transformative enterprise during times spent “between worlds,” when cultural and social patterns are fundamentally changing.
>
> ... Conclusions: What Would Comenius Do?
>
> Existential risks of self-induced extinction shadow the current liminal epoch and its educational crises. Our time between worlds has intensity and ethical weight without historical precedent. But in the shadow of truly planetary risk is also the first true possibility for an emergent planetary paideia. It will be increasingly difficult for social systems to sustain the level of planetary-scale problem solving required in the 21 century. Education must be placed at the center of a global collaborative response to existential risk. In doing this it is possible to address the root causes of the meta-crisis and to expect a cascading impact on all other more specific crises.

> Education can be made the fulcrum of civilizational transition. The unfolding of human potential is a frontier into which we have only first ventured. As Comenius knew, the human is an unfinished project, with cosmic potentials, thus evolved as an image of God. If the center of these efforts that we call civilization were to become education itself, then human development would constitute our shared aim as a species. This would create a state of almost ideal social autopoiesis, radically opening the gates of learning, calling humanity out into its own potentials in perpetuity. This was for Comenius our fate and density as a species: to create an education-centric planetary society, for all people, for the sake of world peace." - [Education must make History Again, by Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)



cultural evolution,[14]
[14] Jean Gebser is the leading light here, but is flanked by writers like William Irwin Thompson, Riane Eisler, and Ian McGilchrist. While these accounts are quite diverse, they focus on reading history through a richly theoretical lens wherein the evolution of culture involves the transformation consciousness itself. Ken Wilber’s Up From Eden: A Transpersonal View of Human Evolution, Anchor Books (1981) is one of the better introductions to the general field.
an integration of multiple academic disciplines.[16]
[16] The Santa Fe Institute has recently published a book on just this field, simply entitled History, Big History, and Metahistory, edited by Krakauer, David C., Gaddis, John Lewis & Pomeranz, Kenneth (2017). The book collects papers from an interdisciplinary conference dedicated to considering the “return” to metahistorical theory and research. Importantly, Big History pushes time sequences back beyond the human to include biological, geological, and cosmic time scale. Big History puts human history within a universal cosmic frame and begins to place the patterns of history alongside the patterns of biological and cosmic evolution.

Angry, soulless, directionless masses? Indifferent, confused citizens? Or a public imbued with confidence, a sense of purpose, a respect for learning, and tolerance? The answer to this question has nothing whatever to do with computers, with testing, with teacher accountability, with class size, and with the other details of managing schools.

But to the extent that school is primarily about credentialing, its goal is to separate the wheat (good future worker bees) from the chaff (slackers, daydreamers, etc.). And if school were easy or fun, it wouldn’t serve this function very well. If there were a way to fast-forward all the learning (and retention) that actually takes place in school—for example, by giving students a magic pill that taught them everything in an instant—we would still need to subject them to boring lectures and nitpicky tests in order to credential them." - [The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9440744-for-example-the-fact-that-school-is-boring-arduous-and)

According to John Stewart we need an escalator to meta-systemic cognition - to have a path for anyone to raise their awareness and understanding of our place in the developmental process and the forces within it
A cultural enlightenment

We are all complicit in ignorance
we need to upgrade our capacity to learn
We are failing at raising humans

Humans are LLMs - you poke poke and stuff comes out, and they go through very suboptimal life-long training

Learning should be a joy - an honor

What if our games taught skills that the GB needs?

We must consciously raise the awareness and education of the so-called masses

## solving real problems
## curiosity, agency
## taking children seriously

What if school work was not something that ends up thrown away but was aimed at contributing to society? What if all their work was meaningful and not thrown away once graded? They feel like their work is pointless & ineffectual. They're forced into non-seriousness. We're creating a kind of immaturity. (All thoughts from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=204qp-YS5Nw Zak Stein - The Education Crisis Elevating Consciousness Podcast)

One upside of having kids learn & compete on serious real world issues in public building a track record is that by the time they're 25-30 they'll have more to show and prove than most 40-50 year olds and could make a serious claim to legitimacy in governance - a way to fix our gerontocracy.

> "The brain is heavily influenced by genes. But from birth through young adulthood, the part of the human brain that most defines us (frontal cortex) is less a product of the genes with which you started life than of what life has thrown at you. Because it is the last to mature, by definition the frontal cortex is the brain region least constrained by genes and most sculpted by experience. This must be so, to be the supremely complex social species that we are. Ironically, it seems that the genetic program of human brain development has evolved to, as much as possible, free the frontal cortex from genes." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8643368-the-brain-is-heavily-influenced-by-genes-but-from-birth)

But it takes a fancy, environmentally malleable frontal cortex to learn culture-specific rules about when it’s okay to throw punches." - [Robert Sapolsky](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8955185-probably-the-most-important-fact-about-genetics-and-culture-is)

## Bildung

> "... the German word Bildung, which is in literal translation close to: “making one’s self into the image of God.” It comes from the German Bild, which means “image” and was coined as a way of expressing a sacred sentiment: that the purpose of education and selfdevelopment is to make oneself into the image of Christ or God. While he did not use this word (he wrote mostly in Latin), nevertheless Comenius is at the root when thinking about Bildung." - [Zak Stein](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-must-make-history-again/)

> "Learning in the Confucian sense differs markedly from “education” as our own schools practice it. It was values-laden and driven by practice, valuing life experience and role models over book learning. The very first line of the Analects places this ethos front and center: “To learn and then apply what you have learned, is this not a pleasure?” (Analects 1:1). Advanced students were exhorted: “The official, having discharged his duties, should devote his leisure to learning. The student, having completed his learning, should apply himself to becoming an official.” (Analects 13:19).
>
> Learning is not the mere acquisition of book knowledge but a continuous cycle of study, practice, reflection, and discussion. Confucian learning is something that is done in the community, with both mentors to learn from and peers to spar with. The Analects themselves are a record of this process, with Confucius instructing and sparring with his disciples and watching as his proteges go on to achieve government positions and take on disciples of their own." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)

^^ maybe take only the (Analects 13:19) part

> "Confucius did not want his students to view themselves as mere technicians or social climbers, but instead cultivate a holistic view about the social contribution of their work. He once said that “the gentleman is not a tool.” (Analects 2:12). Originally intended to warn against overspecialization, against thinking of oneself as a machine churning out deals or billable hours, this remark also rhymes with the modern slang of “tool” as a soulless social climber.
>
> This holistic view included critically thinking about the educational and professional hierarchy itself. Confucius once cuttingly remarked “In a well-governed state, it’s shameful to be poor and unknown; in a poorly governed state, it’s shameful to be rich and in office.” (Analects 8:13). Success in the hierarchy may be a means to the end of building a better society, but it is never an end in itself. There are prestigious institutions and lucrative careers that are damaging to society, such that a noble man would decline them, and moral stands for which statesmen should be ready to risk their careers. In the Confucian school, students were to carefully judge the values an institutional hierarchy promotes before entering it. In modern meritocracy, by contrast, the hierarchy only judges you.
>
> The Confucian orientation forms a telling contrast with modern striving parents, who have a sophisticated understanding of how to get into a good school but cannot articulate why. How many parents who drive their kids to achieve for the sake of getting into a good school can articulate, concretely, what a good school is supposed to do? How many can explain how a management consultant or investment banker—careers that account for over 40 percent of Harvard graduates—ought to serve civilization?
>
> This is not only an abstract societal concern. Parents who do not critically examine the institutions they drive their kids to enter are setting up their children for problems. A 2020 report from a task force in the Harvard University provost’s office reported that 31 percent of students reported suffering from depression, and 30 percent from anxiety disorders. A survey from Nature Biotechnology revealed that 53 percent of PhD students have sought mental health treatment for one of these two conditions. These educational institutions have also presided over a milieu in which marriage and childbearing are increasingly delayed and rare. The prime tenet of the tiger parent is their belief that admission to an elite university is the ticket to a good life. But this belief is disprovable by publicly available data. Their sacrifice towards this end is not only costly in terms of their family’s financial resources, but empirically does not even deliver the goods they sought.
>
> Despite the publicly available statistics, parents repeatedly find themselves surprised when their own children run into these problems. If what they seek is a good future for their children, should they not spend at least a fraction of the striving that goes into test prep and extracurriculars to ensure that their children are mentally well and have the opportunity to start a family? There is a special irony that such parents, allegedly under the influence of a Confucian tradition that venerates the family, end up funneling their kids into careerism and barrenness." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)

> "The Confucian approach offers a different perspective: we should engage with the institutions, but we should not, like tiger parents, allow their perspectives to dictate our values. We must be a judge of institutions rather than being judged by them, and we must imprint our own values on our education." - [The Confucian Cure For Tiger Parenting, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/10/23/the-confucian-cure-for-tiger-parenting/)


> "Most of the discussion of education never actually gets to this question, which put more frankly is just what is a good life? What is valuable? What's actually valuable? What are the lessons that we should teach young people about how to be a good person, about the right ways to act in the world? It's very, very simple questions, which should be at the core of education, which are actually not answered well by secular public schools, which is worth noting because they're specifically designed not to answer questions about the meaning of life. They have the civic religion, which functioned pretty well in the United States. You have the American, civic religion, where yes, you're in the school to be a good citizen, and then you have a kind of 21st century skills view, which is that you're being trained to be a participant in some kind of global workforce, like an accepting, multicultural global workforce because that's an admirable thing. The fact of the matter is that we're running a civilization on a culture that doesn't have clear answers about really fundamental questions about value, which is to say the content of education, the thing we're teaching. We've been running off of fumes of pre-modernity because the answer to what is a good life, it's actually, this is a religious question. What's a life that has not been misspent? Is there a non-arbitrary answer to that, which means an answer that's better than another answer. Not everyone's answers to that is equally valid, which is the default assumption we have now as a culture. Actually, no, there is a better or worse answer to the question of what is a life that has not been spent? What is a good life, which means what should we teach our children to become like, and what should we allow them to grow into or shape them away from? These are the questions that educators have to ask, which are deep, normative ethical questions about value. The collapse of value at the center of culture, meaning the inability to use what Charles Taylor called languages of strong evaluation, makes it so that yes, slowly the effectiveness of the educational system starts to really wane. That's the educational renaissance I'm talking about now is actually a return to a different way of speaking about value at the center of culture, which would be non-relativistic, which would have to boot from a different kind of metaphysics than a metaphysics that suggests to us that the universe itself is without meaning and that the emergence of the human is completely by chance. Just worth saying, there's never been a civilization that has run on the idea that it itself is meaningless, that the value it creates is up to us and doesn't matter to the universe. Hard to invest in a civilization that claims itself to be arbitrary, which is where our civilization has gone to. I'm talking about Yuval Harari, and people who are at the center of culture who are espousing a subtle kind of values relativism, which ends up being insidiously seeping into the educational system, makes it impossible for us to speak in normative ways about the shapes of the personalities and dispositions of the youth, which it is our responsibility to be in a position of authority. Again, it's the responsibility, the honor of the adult to be able to set boundaries. We're confused even about the legitimacy of asymmetric power, period, which is again based on the confusion about value. The work with Gaffney Wilbur, this new book is about this question, what's the core of the issue? It's actually value. Why stop the metacrisis if in fact the universe could give a shit? It's a simple way to say it and it's a little bit provocative, but when you deal with young kids, they ask very simple questions, very simple questions about why adults do the things the way they do." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=1801)

^^ from 30:01 till 34:32

> "To the extent that we want adults to collaborate and work together and resolve problems in ways that are cooperative and not hypercompetitive. We should have schooling environments that are getting kids cooperating about the most fundamental problems that they're working on. But the most fundamental problems that they're working on is their own advancement through the system, even if there's not testing. The other thing is you could take away the test because a huge anti-testing movement, which goes too far in the other direction. Even if you take away the test, we're still in a situation where we're not having honest conversations with kids about their future and very radically funneling different types of opportunities through these competitive bottlenecks. If you're not in a testing environment, then you have to do all these internships and after-school programs and other things, and think three years ahead about the college admissions thing and look at your friends suspiciously and what they're doing with their after-school activities. All of that comes in, even if you're not test-driven, there's still the competitiveness. It's funny because we almost can't imagine an educational system that would be built in a fundamentally different way, which would be one that distributed access to educational resources differently because the issue is that it's how do we actually distribute the educational resources in a way that facilitates this process of intergenerational transmission so that the civilization can not self-terminate." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3120)

^^ from 52:00 till 53:30

> "Legitimate teacherly authority is a very real anthropological phenomenon. Now, my guess is that it goes way back. It's one of the things that distinguishes us from great apes is that we have long duration educational experience that involves this type of legitimate teacherly authority, which is that we both know there's an asymmetry of skill. We both know you're more skilled, and I, the person with less skill really want to learn, and you totally want to teach me. It's a situation of where you have authority over me that I grant you and I give you legitimate authority to help me shape my mind because we both recognize that you have this greater capacity, and I really want to learn this thing. That's legitimate teacherly authority. That can occur anywhere, anytime without any kind of institutionalized context. You hang out with farmers and stuff, so if they have some practice that you've never seen before and you want to learn from them how they get that particular type of crop grown in that way, or manage those cows to not do that thing, even though the cows could totally do that thing, how'd you get them to behave? You would drop into that relationship and you would never thematize it necessarily with them. You wouldn't be like hey, man, now I'm the student and you're the teacher, but there'd be this assumed backdrop of, okay, legitimate teacherly authority. That's a known thing, and it's very powerful and it's very important to be able to recognize that that exists because most of what we encounter with teacherly authority is in bureaucratized contexts where you have teacherly authority over me because of your position in this bureaucracy that I'm a part of, AKA a school. That means there is not necessarily a strong correlation either between my wanting really to give you specifically my authority over me, and B, you actually having an asymmetry of capacity, meaning are you really, really smart at this or are you just teaching some curriculum and I kind of know it, and if I could have my choice, I wouldn't be learning this at all. I'd be learning something else. Illegitimate teacherly authority, bureaucratically sanctioned. Illegitimate teacherly authority is the worst thing because that's a situation where you have bureaucratic authority over my mind, but you don't have greater capacity and you don't have my best interest in mind. That bleeds into propaganda basically as another class of asymmetric relationship, which is basically, so the other thing about the teacherly authority is that he wants you to learn, and in the ideal world, you graduate and you don't need the teacherly authority relationship anymore. So that's key to legitimate teacherly authority is that it's temporary. Legitimate teacherly authority is predicated on the idea that you learn as much as me and surpass me, whereas illegitimate teacherly authority or propaganda is predicated upon "No kid, you'll never actually learn the secret codes or actually learn how we thought about this little bit of dogma, which is kept behind the closed doors." Or just they're training your mind but not with your best interests, whereas a legitimate teacher, there's this cooperative relationship with the student to clarify the value being pursued." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3335)

^^ from 55:35 till 58:50

> "If you think about a civilization, and it needs at least two things to run. It needs the biophysical substrate and it needs the human substrate, if I can speak in crude terms. The core of the human substrate, reproduction, is the mother in the family, which means that the time in utero, the first months, the first years, the solidity of those environments do more than almost anything else. And so you can judge a civilization's likelihood of success in the long run in terms of where it sees value and does it see value there? Does it say actually the core of this whole thing exists right in that little relationship between the mothering one and the child and whatever that nest of caregivers that surrounds the child is that allows it to be brought into the world in a way that is humane and fully attentive. So the very base of the stack you have that need for a very healthy fundamental kind of nest. And then as you get older, you end up, yeah, the parent is the main modeler of legitimate teacherly authority. So the parent's main responsibility in my philosophy of education, bear with me, would be that, would be to be the first way you model legitimate teacherly authority. And the main concern I have now is the confusion of teacherly authority, both through the bureaucratization and through the mediatization, meaning social media, meaning influencers, and then eventually generative AI who claim status as teacherly authority over thousands, millions of young people. So there's this transformation of teacherly authority in the digital that disrupts the ability of the parent to model teacherly authority. So that's a very deep issue." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3573)

^^ from 59:33 till 1:01:32

> "In my book Education in a Time Between Worlds, I suggest that the model of a school is not the way to think about the future of education, so I talk about these distributed educational hub networks. Because the school's already an abstract institution. Civilizationally speaking, we haven't had schools for a long time, and they mostly correlate with not cool stuff. Whereas most of education for most of human didn't exist in schools. It existed in these legitimate dynamics of teacherly authority in non-institutionalized contexts or institutionalized contexts that weren't schools. And so my vision is where the entire community or city is basically turned into a school. So Ivan Illich had this idea called a Deschooling society. I don't know if you know Illich's work or have seen his book, Deschooling Society.... It's an incredible book, and in the seventies see, I ended up basically just updating Illich and saying, "We could do this with machine learning way better." But the basic idea is that there's a time and skill sharing network and a hub of available space, probably the repurposing of the existing large public schools, which allow for every person in the community to register their skills that they'd like to teach, and every person in the community to register the things they'd like to learn. And it's as simple as that, and then every possible educational relationship that is in the community gets shuffled, and you get the creation of pop-up classrooms, and for the younger people, you get the creation of individualized sequences through the full educational potentiality of all the elders in the community. And so you take the school apart, but you make it have no walls, and then you allow the elders somehow to be free from their bullshit jobs, maybe a basic income or something. And you begin to reorient where the value is focused and the whole value of the community becomes focused on the educational actualization of the community, so that you flip the civ stack, where the whole pursuit of all the excess value goes back into the creation of the next generation's ability to pursue good value, which means making good people. So what is the civilization about? The civilization's about making good people and there's not some one little place we do that." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=3922)

^^ from 1:05:23 till 1:07:43

> "A few things are super interesting that are being experimented with, which I talk about in my book. One is aged normed social groupings. Why do we do that? No other societies did that as systematically as we do, meaning you mostly hang out for most of your childhood with kids who are basically exactly your age, by design of the adults. Whereas the one-room schoolhouse, you had all the kids mixed together of the different ages, and therefore teacherly authority was distributed throughout all of the kids because you had the older kids interacting with the younger kids in status of legitimate teacher. So the pop-up classroom model that goes across multiple ages, and that allows for much more flexibility and interaction between social groups and age groups, the impacts of that would be very hard to predict, because the type of maturity that would result from that would be unprecedented. And so just to think that as a design feature of the schools, which you don't question, which is actually quite odd and factory-like, and we still maintain it, which is just that strict segregation by chronological age." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=4136)

^^ from 1:08:56 till 1:10:03

> "I mean, that's a known thing that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it, which is to have to explain it to someone who's never learned it before. I mean, that was actually, I think Plato's definition of that you actually knew something was that you could teach it. And so there's that and just the ethical, the ethical and maturational ability to just deal with kids of different ages, even if you don't have brothers and sisters, and then of course the teacher has a different role there because the teacher is now orchestrating. And in the pop-up classroom, you're not going to have one teacher. Now, there's complex things that occur in early childhood when you need different kinds of environments that need to be built in a certain way. And of course, there's things that occur as they move into adulthood, rites of passage and other things that get them up into expert cultures. One of the main features too is though the doing of real work that needs to be done in the community by the young people, because one of the little dirty secrets about the educational system, adjacent to the competition, is that the homework doesn't mean anything. By David Graeber's definition it's a bullshit job, meaning you're doing a bunch of work, the outcome of which doesn't matter to anyone else except your own further advancement. So most of schools is a situation where the work you're doing affects no one but you. No one needs it to be done, but we don't have to have kids in that situation... The alternative to that would be kids doing internships, like picking up litter, for example, or building trails or learning how a legal firm works or doing anything that is not just route work to keep them busy in a chair all day, which they know doesn't need to be done and which the only reason they're doing it is to beat their friend in the competition to get into college. So it's like, "Whoa." If you had a distributed educational hub network where the pop-up classrooms were such that the person running the classroom was engaged in real work that needed to be done in the community, he's like, "Hey, I'm going to teach you kids about biochemistry by cleaning up this pond." Pond needs to be cleaned up, biochemistry needs to be learned, and the kid doesn't feel a sense of being told that the world's a mess, but he has to wait 17 years before he can get some kind of job and then maybe he'll be able to help with it." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=4232)

^^ from 1:10:32 till 1:12:48

> "The kind of backdrop of a lot of my concerns is the adolescent mental health crisis, it's a legit crisis. It's another argument for some type of emergency education act that's extremely innovative, because that mental health crisis is not going to go away. It's not like all of a sudden those kids will become healthy adults. So we're looking at an entire generation that has completely unprecedented types of psychological disturbances. And again, if the entire surround is what educates and socializes, then you can't just blame the schools, and you can't just blame the phones and stuff. It's a totalizing impact on the youth that is truly destroying their will to continue to contribute to the civilization. So that means there will be a massive withdrawal of support. So, when I mentioned before something like the CCC, I believe that is the only type of thing that could be done. They don't need more psychiatric medication. They don't need more therapy. They don't need more school. They don't need more tests. They need somebody to come in and admit that the adults have made a mess and that they want the kids to help, and then actually give the kids the power and the skills and put them in positions to actually help. Otherwise, we're hypocrites, and they start to read that. That's the other reason they're pulling out. It's just the absence of legitimate discourse among the adults. Clearly the adults don't have things like, look at the election, look at COVID, look at this stuff. Why should we respect adults? So the respecting of the youth, the investing in the youth, and getting very creative about how to engage them in the fixing of real problems. Something like that, something significant with, I'm talking hundreds of millions of kids put in some type of remarkable government/private sponsored, kind of like civic work/education type thing. Not a small, a big thing, which tells a message to the youth, "We freaking care about you. We need your help. You are not a burden. You are not a problem. You are the solution. You are the future. We don't..." How do we signal that to them? Right now, we're signaling the opposite. "We're signaling we don't care about you, we can't even stop the social media guys from destroying your amygdalas. We don't care about you, we can't even get you in a school that's relevant to your future. We don't care about you, we can't even agree as adults and act like adults." So we need to be able to actually send the youth... It's one of the reasons adults actually cooperate is for the sake of the kids. So it's like, we need to send the youth a very strong signal. It's the only thing that will snap them out of it and then give them work to do. They want to work, they want to fix the world. They don't want to live in a hell hole. They want to live in a world where adults are responsible, where adults can get them into situations to help things. So it's kind of simple, but also a huge ask in terms of the type of intervention that could counteract the existing inertia and force in this direction of increasing mental discomfort in the youth. And I'm not even talking about the adults, who are also not doing well. But they're not the future. The kids are the actual future. 20 years from now, these kids who are in... These will be the leaders. Good to think about them. These will be the leaders... Who of that generation will step up to lead during the pinnacle of metacrisis, right? Who will be in that youth generation? Do we have any existing structures that are identifying that kind of youth leadership, that are creating large-scale places for youth to collaborate and work together? So that would be my hope. But it's a pretty dire situation for the youth. And the mental health crisis reveals that." - [Zak Stein](https://youtu.be/zFVoearUvP8?t=6140)

Partly, the length of schooling has increased simply because it could—because we no longer need children to work, yet need them to do something while the adults go do theirs.
>
> The sad result of school’s length and primacy is that it ensures there is nothing in particular for children to do, and since the rigid framework precludes other options, we are sure to destroy their opportunities for making meaningful contributions to the world. The longer we disallow children from having the agency to act on the world, the harder it becomes for them to visualize it in the first place. The result is that we have young adults who have a difficult time adjusting once their life-script changes even a little bit. The path is rigid, yet brittle.
>
> Much of this fault lies with the nature of school, the largest dictator of early life-scripts. Modern schooling began as a track to be left as soon as you had something worthwhile to do with your life. But it has since morphed into an attempt at systematizing as many years of a child’s life as possible, extending well into their adulthood. At the same time, school can never gratify the smartest pupils as much as either party would like, because they are charged with the education of everyone. The result is that many precocious children will spend prime years of their life quite literally waiting for other students to finish.
>
> Mass schooling attempts a systematization of skill and knowledge transfer. The results are predictably mediocre—systems at scale must function with and cater to the lowest common denominator, and the process of standardization loses all sensitivity to context. Since everyone must do the same things, it is difficult for any student to do exceptional things. This is alarming on its own for wasting people’s youth. But even worse, in having so many years of life monopolized, people come to inadvertently believe that skill and knowledge transfer are primarily the domain of school rather than a normal consequence of meaningful work.
>
> The ever-longer march through school creates a bizarre barrier separating the student from reality. As a consequence, childhood consists of the age when one can intuit very well how the world works at the same time one is prevented from acting upon it meaningfully. Instead of making adolescence full of rites of passage where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting and fake work—for school is work. After a time, all children spot this fakeness, and all honest educators note it, saying that one of the most difficult parts of teaching is having to justify why what the children are learning will be relevant and useful.
>
> It is difficult to blame young adults for thinking that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence. When meaningful work is an adult-only activity, it is little wonder that adolescence is a period of great depression. It would be surprising if it was not. Unlike the past, where many smart children finished sooner, modern education endlessly ushers them towards an often farther and more abstract future—one so far away and abstract that some children become infected with the opposite of agency. They take on a learned helplessness and downplay that the future is a reality at all.
>
> Higher education often fails to cure these deficiencies, and some people exit academia well into their twenties almost terrified to leave. How could we celebrate a form of learning that creates something so pathetic—the opposite of a readiness for life?
>
> The institutions of higher and lower education have a purpose, but they are not your friend. They have no sensitivity to context. Their incentives are not the same as your incentives, and they have no interest in any individual going off-script. They ask nothing of you but time and eventually money, but these are not trivial things. And they will take as many of your prime years as you are willing to give them. School should be leveraged only so long as meaningful work is unavailable.
>
> This is not the worship of employment, but an observation of fundamentals: it seems that the more you ask of people and the more you have them do, the more they rise up to the task of doing it on their own. While we shouldn’t allow children to be bobbin boys, no one would describe Steve Job’s summer job at 13 as his exploitation.
>
> We should be thinking much harder about ensuring children can make meaningful contributions, and we should be teaching them in ways that are sensitive to the context of the real world. We are not looking for a job but opportunities for mastery: learning and practice beyond the depth one would find along the common path, which demands no such thing." - [School Is Not Enough, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/)

> "User-generated content does not need the benefit of large audiences or the approval of large broadcasting companies. Students do not need permission to attend. In corners of the internet that are easy to miss, the biggest renaissance of informal skills transfer in history is happening right now. Unlike textbooks or professors, the creators of these educational materials are willing to engage with random students throughout the world, provide feedback, and even arrange meetups—often for free.
>
> A close look at social media reveals ample opportunity for self-apprenticeship. We live in an era where a motivated 12-year-old can learn the basics of timber framing, semiconductor design, or how to bake bread that would rival world-class bakeries. They can master nearly any mechanical system or any number of programming or artistic vocations, even if no mentor lives nearby. The limit is no longer some teacher or institution but a child’s own patience and interest, as well as the interested support of the parents.
>
> Often the parents of precocious children do not appreciate this interest. They think a child engrossed in Minecraft is simply playing video games, instead of longing to build. It is the parent’s job to identify this motivation, and then leverage technology and their own resources to encourage something more meaningful. “He’s going to do great things one day.” In his thirties? Why not today?
>
> We can somewhat excuse schools for only covering topics broadly. But if education matters to a parent, then they should think hard about how they can allow their child a deep venture. Parents owe it to children to furnish them with materials, time, and useful pursuits. Schools will not supply them, and the most common failure mode with parenting is probably giving children options along the same feeble lines, and responsibilities too close to what they already have at school.
>
> Occasionally parents might gesture towards an activity like a lemonade stand on the sidewalk to gratify a child’s interest. This example is the archetypal poor choice: A lemonade stand does not teach the value of money but how to wait and occasionally beg. To understand business or hospitality, children would be better off trying to make something people really wanted.
>
> For example, a better home craft than lemonade might be a pastry, taken seriously. Not just a sugar cookie, but the kind of thing that is plain for a 13-year-old to understand, harder for him to make, and very difficult to master. If a child committed to a batch a day, documenting progress, perhaps he would quickly have something worth selling.
>
> And perhaps selling these at the end of the street won’t work, but it might work selling them somewhere repeatable and meaningful, like at a local soccer practice. Leveraging existing technology and a supportive parent, there’s no reason a young teenager couldn’t make thousands this way while perfecting the mastery of something deeper than school would ever teach at the same age.
>
> Pastries come to mind as an example because Pierre Hermé, one of the most famous pastry chefs and chocolatiers in the world, began as an apprentice at 14. This is admirable, but it would be a shame for us to wait around for some mentor to appear. The ultimate mentor is always the parent and the resources are broader than ever. What can your child make today? What can he do that’s both rewarding and difficult? What can you do to facilitate such a thing? Or if you’re young enough yourself—what can you master?
>
> The goal is not to invent a job but to create a path to mastery or responsibility. If a child can sell the fruit of his labor, so much the better. But the essential lesson is that every difficult thing attempted acts as a multiplier on his confidence and the rest of his knowledge. Drudgery is sometimes confused with building character, and I think this is a mistake. It is building skill that builds self-possession. After selling thousands of dollars worth of pastries over the summer, a child does not only know that he can make pastries. He knows that he can make anything.
>
> I think that it is worth some special reflection as to why programming is now the typical industry for precocious children. In many ways, it has a low bar to entry and is something that parents still allow their children to do despite the hour-demands of systematized schooling. It is one of the few industries with an immensely permissionless culture. You don’t need an audience or patrons. You don’t have to ask anyone. You don’t have to get a building permit or any professional resources. You can just create. The advantages of this, especially for some children who are not allowed to do much else with their time, are immense. We should ask ourselves, slowly, carefully, and often: what else can be like that?
>
> It would be most desirable if there were a formula for instilling mastery, a guide of recipes and options for every child or young adult. But so long as society is committed to treating children unseriously, the obvious apprenticeships will be few. There may be more varied options than ever for any given child, but none of them will come to him on their own. They will lie just off the path, and the child will need to go looking. One reason that schools will always do poorly at finding such opportunities for children is that the very best opportunities will always be a response to local needs—a sensitivity to context is precisely the thing that systems of scale fail at producing. But both parent and child should never confuse this with a lack of options. Our era is resource-rich, including educational resources, but onramp poor. The legwork is up to you.
>
> Many fairy tales and stories are about finding one’s place. The hero begins as a child full of wonder and ends up achieving mastery over the world. Visions of the future need to allow people—not just the cleverest among us, but all people—to imagine accepting a place in the world. If we fail to do this during the years of education, then we are not really educating. If we fail to allow children continuous contact with the world, we risk them coming to see their own lives as mere abstractions.
>
> The purpose of education is to develop agency within a child. Purposeful work and achieving mastery are tools to getting there. They aren’t the results of learning and imagination, it’s the other way around—learning is simply the consequence of doing. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters genius and talent." - [School Is Not Enough, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/)


> "... the education of the world’s diverse populations can and will decide the fate of nations, the global community, and humanity at large. The responsibility—and creative potential—to get education right even extends beyond our current humanity, as effects
of our choices today inevitably cascade into future generations and the biosphere.
>
> ... What, if anything, is education? My contention is that education, in the strictest and primordial sense, is play... Children of homo sapiens, left to their own devices, play. The behavioral explanation for this may be the inherent joy of playing, the intrinsic motivation of performing a task for its own reward. The evolutionary purpose of this same reward (the reason nature has selected for it), however, is that something is learned, and that something increases the chances of survival... play, in many ways, is a kind of imitation, whereby learning is achieved. Species that depend on more learning for their survival have longer periods of childhood, growth and learning. Play is also a way to form bonds, upon which collaboration and relationships can be built. Non-adulthood—i.e. childhood and youth—is defined by growth; the growth of faculties to feed, procreate and protect... Play gives way to work, work being different from play in that it serves the purpose of acquiring resources, such as food and shelter.
>
> In humans, culture constitutes patterns of knowledge that are inherited over generations. This includes such cultural technologies as spoken language, writing, and arithmetic. These technologies, in turn, cannot be learned only by spontaneous imitation and play. The play must somehow be organized and systematized, so that its outcomes of learning will resonate with culture.
>
> Education, then, is the naturally occurring tendency to play, albeit extended into a more systematized realm of culture; it is play connected to a larger whole. Education guides play—sometimes at the expense of oppressing its spontaneous expressions, sometimes by successfully harnessing the will to play and bewondered curiosity we all harbor—and shapes it into culture.
>
> ... Which nations will stimulate their children into the best learning practices, using which ideas and technologies? Which first movers will spark childlike curiosity in their growing adult populations? Where—and how—will a multifaceted continued adult development flourish throughout the lifespan, so that populations may best handle the complex issues of our time? Which cultures and regions will spur growth and thus shape global civilization, contributing to its survival? Only by rescuing playfulness can we survive and thrive; education is play; play is growth; growth is survival." - [Education for Protopia: Why Play Is Vital to our Survival, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/education-for-protopia-why-play-is-vital-to-our-survival/)

> "The question thus naturally presents itself: How can human beings meet in educational settings in ways where motivation is spurred, curiosity nurtured, participation encouraged, and emotions and needs respected and developed? To be realistic, most meetings, in most settings, don’t truly “touch us”; we are left largely unchanged. Some meetings even feel detrimental to our health and development, and some feel overly draining. Can impoverished educational interactions become fewer, and the productive ones become more commonplace? How can we make education, as it were, touch the souls of learners? To answer this, we must venture into the realm of psychology—and into the realm of inner experience, of emotions, of what development means in terms of real, felt, and embodied human relations.
>
> ... Trust has at least four dimension: trusting in the competence of one another, the reliability of one another, the goodwill of one another, and that one’s interests are aligned... An investment in trust is an investment in safety, is an investment in play, is an investment in growth." - [Protopian Education Four: Humanizing Pedagogical Relationships, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/protopian-education-four-humanizing-pedagogical-relationships/)

> "If education’s future ultimately depends upon the surrounding systems, the practices of education must become better connected to these same systems... It is an unfortunate effect of the conventional educational systems that they seldom—sometimes never—entail “real work”; i.e. tasks in which there are at least a minimum of external stakeholders who care about the results of any given assignment: not about the grading of the assessment. Many students go through their whole educational experience without ever quite “learning by doing”, as all school work is and remains within the boundaries of a great “as if”. This, if anything, can foster alienation in schools, and it can arguably undermine the sense of self-worth and self-efficacy of students who graduate from a long education but yet have no real world experience to show for it. “Skin in the game” is a term that has recently gained popularity with the publishing of Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s 2018 book with the same title. Accountability, Taleb argues, is difficult if not impossible to achieve as long as people have no skin in the game, if they don’t stand to lose directly from the consequences of their own decisions and contributions. Likewise, in education, learning to gain confidence and being held accountable, is difficult to achieve without working with real-world projects. But within the confines of the classroom, it is almost inconceivable to see how students could do projects that are directly relevant to other stakeholders. Hence, education may increasingly need to break out of the classroom, and branch off into other fields of society: industries, healthcare, social services, environmental projects, and so forth. Chuck Pezeshki (complexity scientist, engineer) argues that his engineering students are only able to work in real companies with real stakeholders (and, often, real results for the companies) because of his own long personal history of building up the relationships with those same companies. His work highlights what may be a future professional role within education: establishing contacts to the outside world with as many and as varied agents as possible—so that learners can engage in real projects, with real stakes. There may be other pedagogical gains from the development of such an approach: That education gains ongoing vital influences from other fields has already been mentioned, but it may also be emphasized that motivation to learn can increase. If students need specific knowledge to successfully finish their real-world projects, this can indeed place teachers in the more privileged position of being a cherished mentor for coveted skills. In short, reconnecting education to society can foster a sense of agency and initiative, rather than passive learning.
>
> ... What Is Being Measured? The conventional system of measuring and grading educational results seems to have few friends among my interviewees and forward-thinking commentators. And indeed, a system can only truly be calibrated to manage that which it somehow measures. What is being left out? One point that has been brought up is that conventional grading works opposite to the rewarding principles of “gamification”: making learning more like an entertaining game. If a video game starts with zero points, and then you work your way through treasure chests, fruits, and bonus levels, you feel enriched and that you are making progress. But grading starts with an “A” (or whichever the highest grade is) and then your work your way downwards by making mistakes or not knowing answers, and your efforts are marked with a red ink pen in the process. There are certainly issues of simple motivation-boosting techniques that could help learners to feel more motivated and positive about the experience, for instance, by simply turning grading on its head. Zak Stein maintains that the measuring systems are themselves defunct, in effect measuring skills and capacities in too limited, and ultimately unscientific, ways... He calls for a reformation of the measuring systems so that more just and holistic method comes to the fore: seeing how complex and intricate the independent tasks performed by the students are. Brad Kershner agrees, through his experience working with children, that the sole focus on test results hinders the design of a truly nurturing education, because it ignores the main piece of the puzzle: the quality of relationships between teachers and pupils. This view is echoed in related manner by Gregg Henriques (clinical psychologist, professor). He notes that the measures of qualitative variables like wellbeing, relationships, self-development, emotional maturity, and perspective-taking skills are entirely lacking: and yet, they may very well constitute the most important part of what is means to grow and learn. Introducing such measures into educational systems may require a host of measuring devices—but these are in fact already available within the discipline of psycho-metrics, and may be ready to use after some adjustments. How would education be guided differently in its design, if the measuring systems were both more holistic, had better prediction of real-life outcomes, and included more variables pertaining to human happiness and flourishing? The mere existence of such measurements might change how agents within the educational systems view themselves and how they understand and enact their work. Said differently, the measuring systems of education may be one of the major flaws in the current paradigm: they force teachers and students into an impersonal and distance machine of quantification. But this does not mean that grading should be abolished altogether; rather, our interviewees seem to hold, it should be reformed in a more holistic, sensitive, accurate, and relevant direction..." - [Protopian Education Five: Shift the Human-to-System Relations, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/protopian-education-five-shift-the-human-to-system-relations/)

> "Meta-skills are the larger frameworks within which we use our skills, capacities, and talents; as such, they are closer to traits or properties of the person, than to knowledge. The Oak Island (or in Swedish, Ekskäret) Foundation have proposed five such meta-skills—or what they call “transformative capabilities”—which they endeavor to support, especially in business leaders and international leaders: openness, perspective seeking, (not just perspective taking) sensemaking, inner compass, and compassion... If our environments are changing more rapidly, and economies evolve through transitions, does it not make sense to direct greater resources to cultivating meta-skills, which are useful no matter what specific skills we may need to acquire, hone, and use during our lifetimes? If meta-skills are the frameworks within which our talents are brought together and used, are they not a form of learning more likely to matter?
>
> Traits Last Longer - The set of “transformative capacities” suggested by the Oak Island Foundation refers to meta-skills that are worthy goals, but perhaps not the most basic and fundamental ones from a strictly educational/schooling perspective. Qualities that make each person function and thrive may include:
>
> Good learning capacity (needs continuous training and drilling)
>
> Good social skills (as reflected in the Inner Development Goals)
>
> Self-knowledge (this can be informed, for instance, by the psychological flexibility theory—it later found its way into the Inner Development Goals)
>
> Positive emotions
>
> Strong physiology
>
> Good relationships
>
> Good health habits
>
> All of these present viable alternatives as goals of education... But I am presenting this list to make an argument: It is traits like these that are likely to be the strongest predictors of a good life. More so, perhaps, even than traits like openness and compassion (which are, naturally, also very important). It is, all things considered, possible to imagine a person that is not very open, and not very compassionate, but who still lives a happy and productive life, good for themselves, and good for others. It is more difficult to imagine a person with poor learning capacity, poor social skills, no self-knowledge to speak of, no positive emotions, a weak health and tense body, poor relationships, and poor health habits—who still thrives and is good for others. Or, vice versa, it is almost inconceivable to imagine a person who has all of these qualities, but still lives an unhappy life. And it is not difficult to make the case that almost any subject learned in conventional schooling—save perhaps for reading, writing, and basic arithmetic in a modern society—would have a greater impact on the likelihood of a life well lived. I do not claim that this list is final. What we seek to underscore is the way of thinking, the perspective: The traits that are undeniably useful to all people, in all walks of life, that make up the most basic building blocks of a good life should be identified—and invested in through education. Such qualities may not sound as lofty and exciting, but that does not make them any less important. They have exceedingly high likelihood of producing good results—and avoiding bad results—over the lifespan. Even the gifted poet or scientist can collapse under the weight of the difficulties of life, and while society of course depends upon there being good poets and scientists, it also depends on the general resilience of those same people. And these basic qualities are, unsurprisingly, interrelated: strong physiology affects emotions, which affect relationships, which affect social skills, which affects self-knowledge, which affects good health and learning habits—and so on. Each of the qualities can, in turn, be cultivated and trained, not least by designing the educational systems to this end. Perhaps, then, these qualities should be made the top priority of the whole educational system. It should likely improve results on other learning goals as well, be it within arts, chemistry, or languages.
>
> ... Just how difficult are the meta-skills to cultivate? How can education truly entail meetings that “touch the soul” and transform our perspectives? If we are to believe one of my interviewees, John Vervaeke (professor of cognitive science) present-day cultures around the world are subject to a severe “meaning-crisis”; a collective, existential crisis pertaining to the lack of sense-making capacities in the populations. According to Vervaeke, many of the maladies that societies around the world experience are somehow related to this meaning-crisis. Religions used to offer a whole package of viewpoints and techniques to foster self-knowledge and sense-making, but today they find it difficult to fill this role. Vervaeke suggests, much in line with the Oak Island Foundation, that new structures must be invented and put into place, building on the best interdisciplinary science possible, to help people construct their own sense of meaning and direction in life. Such work includes, as we have seen in a previous chapter, facing one’s own weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and finding ways to integrate and embody them. How could we, for instance, be compassionate and curious for new perspectives, if our inner lives are still wounded, clenched and confused? Briefly stated, yes, cultivating meta-skills is a difficult task, and it may require some resilience, energy and effort on the parts of everyone involved. Meta-skills require transformational work, and that often includes periods of confusion and even painful work. And yet—without meta-skills like compassion and openness—how could we hope to have the capacities to not only live productive lives, but to collectively tackle the global issues of climate change and technological disruptions? This view of education—that its main aim is to foster basic resilience, happiness, and meta-skills—of course partly contradicts the focus on making learners employable on the job market. Yet, there is reason to believe that the nature of job markets would itself be transformed if such meta-skills were successfully cultivated throughout society, and thus pervading the economy. Highly functional people with good relationships are, in the long run, also less likely to end up unemployed, burned out, or on sick-leave. Simply: traits last longer than specific skills. So the priority should be: first, the building blocks of basic resilience; second, the meta-skills; and third, skills and knowledge. That has the highest likelihood of educating people in ways that are genuinely useful. We may even end up with more useful and specific skills and knowledge for it, as people take better charge of their lives and steer it with an inner compass. This is core to the new paradigm of education.
>
> ... However, the “learning how to learn” argument goes deeper yet. If people are empowered to learn more quickly and easily, their learning autonomy increases, i.e., learners gain more power over what they wish to learn, and learning is one of the most empowering and rewarding experiences of all. If all grow up in an information society, it almost seems callous to leave all children after age 10 on to their own devices when it comes to this core capacity. It is even a question of personal freedom or emancipation within an information society, since each person can free themselves more from what others teach or assign then, and learn from their own hearts. This connects, in turn, to the issue of lifelong learning. If the average person has been diligently trained for years in the art of learning, they will have a higher capacity and lower resistance to learning new things and subject matters throughout their life—which, by the way, serves the meta-skills of openness, perspective seeking, and sense-making. And then there’s the job-market argument. If job markets do indeed become more complex and volatile, it makes sense to properly equip populations with the highest possible learning capacity." - [Protopian Education Six: Honing the Meta-Skills, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/protopian-education-six-honing-the-meta-skills/)

> Simply stated, agreement upon a shared map of how education can and should be transformed is necessary for real progress to be made—what are the different pathways and how do they interrelate? The map does not have to be perfect to be usable, nor is agreement required about the details. It only needs to be “good enough for now, safe enough to try”; it just needs basic consent from key stakeholders (as the formerly discussed sociocratic method of governance states). Not consensus—only consent. And it is by having such a shared map, that rifts between different global organizations, countries and other key agents can be bridged. If key stakeholders show up at a workshop with such a shared framework in mind, the ability to reach shared understanding and align interests may be increased. Again, even if the map may need improvement, it can offer a place to start from. And from there on, strategic alliances of reformers can be forged around the different pathways, or other projects that relate to them and have synergies with them, or in synergies across and between them—and this can help to escape the political and economic constraints that hold the field of global education, and its key players, in check... The more people have a shared map, the easier they can cooperate and find pathways through the maze...

Libertarianism ignores the possibility of equilibrium selection at the level of rational social discourse, and assumes that decentralized market dynamics will magically lead to equilibria that yield the highest aggregate social benefits.

# SECTION: Social Systems

> "Social systems, such as nations, organizations and religions, exert an immense power on the behavior of the individuals that participate in them. Most of the actions we perform on any given day are either directly prescribed by social systems, or largely constrained, inspired or sanctioned by them. Our beliefs, thoughts and emotions are to an important extent determined by the norms, culture and morals that we acquired via processes of education, socialization and communication. These norms, once assimilated by the individual, powerfully control the behavior of the people that participate in the social system, up to the point that they are willing to kill others or themselves in order to uphold these norms—as illustrated most poignantly by the phenomenon of suicide terrorism. Few people dare to question such socially imposed rules. Even fewer people are aware that these rules are the product of a to some degree arbitrary process of social construction, which reduces reality to a limited system of selective categories and associated behaviors...
>
> Social systems can be understood as autopoietic networks of distinctions and rules that govern the interactions between individuals... The distinctions structure reality into a number of socially sanctioned categories or conditions, while ignoring phenomena that fall outside these categories. The rules specify how individuals should act under the thus specified conditions. Thus, a social system can be modelled as a network of condition-action rules that directs the behavior of individual agents. These rules have developed through the differential reinforcement of certain types of social actions, and the suppression of others. The process that stabilizes certain rules but not others is a form of distributed self-organization in which the distinctions and actions made by different individuals adapt the one to the other, until they form a closed system of coordinated, mutually aligned symbols, concepts and rules.
>
> This means that the actions or communications observing these rules engender actions that themselves observe these same rules. In other words, the system of social actions or communications perpetually reinforces and reproduces itself. It is closed in the sense that it does not generate actions following rules that are not part of the system; it is self-maintaining in the sense that all actions obeying rules that are defining parts of the system are eventually produced again. This property of recursive self-production is known as autopoiesis. It turns the social system into an autonomous, organism-like agent, with its own identity that separates it from its environment through some symbolic boundary. This identity or “self” is preserved by the processes taking place inside the system. Through interactions, the system is structurally coupled with its outside or “non-self”. The “non-self” influences that endanger the system’s autopoiesis are interpreted as perturbations that must be compensated or counteracted, so as to ensure the continuing survival of the system.
>
> Such self-perpetuating identity is an emergent property of the system, i.e. a property that cannot be reduced to the properties of the system’s components (interactions between individuals), but that arises from the way these components are organized into a whole. This emergent constraint now to some degree prescribes the behavior of the components, through a mechanism known as downward causation. A simple example of such an emergent (but not necessarily social) system is a language: a collection of distinctions, words and grammatical rules that tells individuals how they should formulate their communications. This system has self-organized out of distributed interactions, with the result that no individual human has the power to change its rules or to ignore its prescriptions.
>
> From this perspective, the human beings who participate in autopoietic social systems are merely a resource exploited by the system for its own perpetuation. While the system needs these individuals to continue performing the social actions that constitute its identity, it does not a priori care for their well-being. Therefore, a social system in some sense behaves like a parasite, extracting resources (social activities) from these individuals without necessarily returning the favor. Of course, social systems also bring benefits to the people whose actions they direct. In general, the relation between the two types of autopoietic agents, human individuals and social systems, is one of co-evolution, mutual adaptation or symbiosis, where the one to some degree benefits from the other. For example, individuals profit from social systems because the latter typically help them to coordinate their actions and to prevent free riding and within-group conflicts.
>
> ... the phenomena we perceive, conceive and distinguish are to a large extent dependent on the categorizations and judgments sanctioned by the social system. In linguistics, this has been formulated as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: what we perceive is to some degree dependent on the words our culture provides to describe what we perceive. More fundamentally, what we think and understand is largely dependent on the concepts and categories provided by the social systems, and by the rules that say which category is associated with which other category of expectations or actions..." - [Social Systems Programming: Behavioral and Emotional Mechanisms Co-opted for Social Control](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SSP2mechanisms.pdf)

<!--
> "**How social systems impede self-actualization**
>
> Social rules extend much farther than matters of gender, body or etiquette: they govern not just public behavior, but the whole of our worldview, i.e. our picture of reality and our role within it. They tell us which are the major categories of existence (e.g. mind vs. body, duty vs. desire), what properties these categories have (e.g. mind is insubstantial, the body is inert and solid, duty is real and desire is phantasmagoric), and what our attitudes and behaviors towards each of these categories should be (e.g. the body is to be ignored and despised, desire is to be suppressed). While many of these rules are useful (e.g. that you should be polite towards strangers) or neutral (e.g. that you should eat lunch at noon rather than at 3 pm), others are heavily limiting (e.g. that girls should not study math).
>
> However, the fundamental problem is that since social rules are typically tacit and supposed to be universally valid, there is no way of ascertaining whether they are beneficial or harmful to human well-being. These rules have self-organized out of distributed social interactions. Therefore, there is no individual or authority that has a direct power to change them or announce them obsolete. That means that we, as individuals, have become subjected to systems that expect us to maintain their own organization, without us recognizing our participation in this autopoiesis. Thus, these systems have programmed us to blindly follow their rules, without questioning or conscious consent.
>
> Of course, in practice social systems can be more or less liberal in allowing deviations from the rules—with conservative, fundamentalist and totalitarian cultures typically being least flexible. Moreover, some rules (like covering the feet) tend to be enforced much less strictly than others (like covering the genitals). Thus, in most societies there is enough leeway to allow some variation and evolution of rules. However, this may create a false sense of individual autonomy, as people feel free to question those rules that have lost most of their power, or that were never firmly established in the first place, while ignoring the rules that appear so self-evident that they are not even aware that they are obeying them (e.g. that you should not come barefoot to a job interview).
>
> Therefore, people wishing to solve social ills by designing a better society are often thwarted by their own implicit prejudices: they tend to focus on specific rules they see as detrimental without noting that these are part of an invisible and much more complex network of mutually reinforcing rules. Such a system is much more difficult to change, partly because of its self-protecting, autopoietic character, partly because the would-be social revolutionary is just as much programmed by these rules as anybody else. Thus, social systems programming is an important obstacle to social progress and to the search for creative solutions to contemporary problems.
>
> It in particular hinders individual emancipation, or what humanist psychologists have called “self-actualization”. This is the ongoing development of an individual’s potentials, and a necessary condition for enduring well-being. Self-actualization requires the ability to find one’s own path in life by exploring a wide range of possibilities and choosing the ones that best fits one’s personality, circumstances and interests...
>
> ... we should note that since social systems are continuously evolving, it may so happen that during their evolution a particular rule (such as the taboo on homosexuality) is revoked, thus eliminating what was a major hindrance to human self-actualization in a given society. However, because social systems and human individuals are autonomous organizations with distinct interests, the trajectories of the two do not in general coincide. When they are inconsistent, the social system will obstruct the human trajectory towards self-actualization. Such obstruction is not a mere side effect of the rigidity of social systems: it is an essential part of their identity. An autopoietic system aims at self-maintenance. Therefore, it will counteract any processes that threaten to perturb its organization. In particular, it will suppress anything that would put into question the rules that define it...
>
> **The power of narratives**
>
> Unlike animals, people can anticipate events even when they have never experienced such events in reality... Social systems exploit this anticipatory ability in part by evolving and propagating stories that illustrate how people who behave in the socially sanctioned manner reap huge rewards, such as fame, fortune, or eternal happiness in an envisioned Heaven—or alternatively receive harsh punishments, like burning in Hell, if they do not behave in this manner. As Malinowski pointed out long ago, myths function not to explain why things are the way they are (e.g. why we wear clothes in the myth of Adam and Eve), but as social charters (why we must wear clothes). They comprise commands that legitimize the social order, exhorting and coercing certain behaviors by showing how certain characters are punished or rewarded for specific actions. Such narratives have the advantage that they are easy to grasp, remember and communicate, because they embed abstract norms, rules and aspirations into sequences of concrete events experienced by concrete individuals with whom the audience can easily empathize... For example, in our present consumer society, the reigning narrative that you will become happy by acquiring ever more money that allows you to buy ever more products is reinforced by an endless series of advertisements, movies and magazine articles. Herman and Chomsky have argued that the mass media in practice manufacture consent, i.e. make people agree with the way the system functions. They do this by presenting the established social order as the only workable approach, while ignoring or curtly dismissing alternative approaches. Such constant confirmation of a heavily biased narrative ensures that people do not rebel or question the status quo.
>
> **Conformist transmission**
>
> More generally, reinforcement is more effective the more it is repeated. As a social system is built out of self-reproducing networks of communications, this ensures that its messages will not be heard once, but again and again. Conformist transmission denotes the self-reinforcing dynamic according to which you become more likely to adopt a narrative, idea or behavior as more other individuals communicate it to you. Once you have adopted such a belief, you become more inclined to convert others to this belief, or to confirm it when others express it. Thus, an idea that is confirmed by several individuals tends to make further converts who themselves will make further converts. The resulting positive feedback of common beliefs becoming more common means that popular opinions tend to spread until they encompass the whole group. As the same belief is reinforced again and again by every person you meet, it becomes very difficult to develop, retain or adhere to a non-conforming view. This in part explains the counterintuitive result that conformity pressure can overrule first-hand observation. The result is a homogeneous culture of commonly accepted norms and beliefs that encompasses a given group of communicating individuals...
>
> **Cognitive dissonance and institutionalized action**
>
> Another behavioral mechanism exploited for social programming is our preference for coherence in thought and action. When an individual has mutually inconsistent beliefs, this creates an unpleasant tension, known as cognitive dissonance. The simplest remedy is to reject or ignore some of these thoughts, so that the remaining ones are all consistent. This mechanism can obviously be used to eliminate non-conformist ideas and behaviors. A straightforward method is to make an individual perform certain actions that conform to the rules of the social system but that are dissonant with that individual’s non-conformist beliefs. Since the actions that have already been performed cannot be denied, it is easier to resolve the tension by denying the beliefs inconsistent with the actions... the undeniable act of praying to God can only be safeguarded from cognitive dissonance by denying any doubts you may have about the existence of God. This creates a coherence between inner beliefs and socially sanctioned actions, which now come to mutually reinforce each other in an autopoietic closure. As anthropologists have detailed in their study of religion, believers often explain away inconsistencies in their beliefs through interpretive drift, which Luhrmann describes as “the slow often unacknowledged shift in someone’s manner of interpreting events as they become absorbed in a particular activity”. This can be seen as a continuation of the self-organizing evolution through which the different rules of the social system mutually align so as to minimize dissonance...
>
> **Emotions co-opted for social control**
>
> Whilst reinforcement presents a fairly simple mechanism to program human behavior, emotions are far more intricate. Nevertheless, emotions provide a powerful impetus to instill actions and attitudes. Social systems have learnt to harness emotions to impel strong and long-lasting effects that are difficult to override through reflection or reasoning. They thus ensure that human behavior does not deviate from their norms and conditioning. Emotions co-opted for social control act insidiously and in such a manner that people come to police their own behavior even when alone, i.e. in the absence of any social process of reinforcement or punishment. This is because humans internalize social norms in such a way that an external observer is no longer necessary to enforce or uphold these rules. This guarantees that the social system’s standards are always maintained, even when there is no practical need apart from the selfperpetuation of the system... By harnessing people’s emotions, social systems manage to override their rational reflections, spontaneous behaviors and playful desires. They thus to an important extent take away individuals’ control over their own bodies, feelings and self, instead turning them into mere agents of the social system, who police both themselves and others. All emotions can in principle be co-opted to support a social system. For example, love and awe can be harnessed to venerate the formal (e.g. the king) or symbolic (e.g. Christ) leader of the social order, while anger can be incited to attack its enemies...
>
> **Fear: ostracism and xenophobia**
>
> Inducement of fear is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward method to prevent the transgression of social norms. Fear is the anticipation of a potentially harmful event, leading the individual to avoid anything that might trigger such an event. In social systems, this anticipated event is typically a punishment for not behaving according to the rules. This punishment can be very concrete, like having to go to bed without dinner, receiving a fine, or being stoned to death. However, it can also be more abstract and general, like experiencing disapproval, rejection or ostracism. Fear of ostracism appears to be a deeply rooted instinct that functions like a powerful check on deviant behavior. People will go to great efforts to act in a socially expected way in order to make sure they are not excluded, rejected or ignored by their community—even if this means denying what they truly believe in or who they truly are. This instinctive fear probably dates back to our evolutionary past when social exclusion of an individual commonly ended in that individual dying because of starvation, exposure or the inability to defend against predators. But it also plays in seemingly more innocuous situations, like when a high school student is shunned by the rest of her class because she does not fit in with the local norms (e.g. by not wearing the right brand of clothes or listening to the wrong kind of music). This feeling can be just as devastating, leading to deep loneliness, shame and depression that may end in suicide. Foucault has detailed how many supposedly medical conditions and labels, such as madness or homosexuality, have served to ostracize individuals. During the height of the Enlightenment era those deemed irregular or different were classified as insane. Thus, madness was constructed as a mental and moral illness requiring that sufferers be confined and treated like beasts. The incarceration of the mad served to induce fear in the populace, thereby deterring them from deviating from prescribed behaviors and causing them to repress their identities and desires. In xenophobia, fear is used by the social system to keep out individuals who belong to a different social system with different norms. Such aliens are portrayed as potentially dangerous intruders that must be shunned or, if necessary, violently repelled. An outside threat is probably the most direct and reliable method to strengthen the coherence of the “in-group” and thus suppress any risk of dissidence. The resulting “Us vs. Them” mentality has been used by political leaders throughout the ages to consolidate their regime.

> **Structural control mechanisms**
>
> Social systems not only control individuals by directly affecting their feelings, but by setting up routines and structures that reinforce rule-following behavior. There are of course endless types of institutions, organizations, political power structures, and legal arrangements designed to impose rules and control individual behavior. These have been discussed in an extremely broad literature in sociology, management, law, politics and economics, which we are not going to review here. Instead, we will focus on some of the bio-psychological mechanisms that enable such structures to take root in the psyche.

> **Insecurity**
>
> ...
>
> **Status and hierarchy**
>
> Like many related social species (such as chimpanzees, baboons or wolves), humans have an instinct for forming status hierarchies in which the high-status individuals behave dominantly towards those lower in the “pecking order”, while the low-status ones behave submissively towards those higher up. Yet, hunter-gatherer bands are remarkably egalitarian. They ensure that no hierarchy arises by ridiculing, shunning or if necessary expelling individuals who behave too dominantly and bully others into submission (Boehm, 2001). This democratic organization seems to have been lost with the transition to agricultural settlements. As social systems became more elaborate, they developed complex, rigid hierarchies, where figures at the top (pharaohs, emperors, kings…) had nearly absolute power and were revered as divine authorities (Campbell, 1991). In more recent times, the power of elites is more restricted, and movement up or down the hierarchy has become easier. However, there remains a great social stratification separating the rich and powerful from the poor and destitute.
>
> The common view is that such hierarchical structures are upheld by the individuals or groups that have most power, because that allows them to extract more than their fair share of the resources collected by the community. Therefore, rebellions, revolutions and other attempts to change the social order tend to be directed at removing the elite that is in power. However, in practice the result tends to be that one leader or ruling class is replaced by another one, while the hierarchy remains in place. That is because the rebels tend to be impelled by the same desire to increase their power relative to others, and thus snatch up a position at the top of the hierarchy.
>
> Let us reinterpret this observation in terms of self-perpetuating social systems. A control hierarchy helps the social system to stabilize its network of rules because those at the top have the power to punish or suppress the ones below that might deviate from these rules. The dominant players are motivated to sustain the rules, because these rules confirm their own position of authority. Those at the bottom have more reason to question the system. However, because the system channels most of the resources to the top, the underlings are too weak to challenge it. If exceptionally some of them grow strong enough to overthrow the elite, they would simply be enticed by the riches and power that become available to them, and thus constitute a new elite. In this way, regime changes, invasions and coup d’états tend to be recuperated by the social system, so that its autopoiesis remains intact. While the individual agents change, the structure of their interactions is maintained. Thus, social systems have learned to channel the human instinct for status and dominance into acting according to their rules, thereby safeguarding their organization.
>
> **How different status hierarchies use co-opted emotions**
>
> ... In the quadrangle, emotions overlap as they are often difficult to distinguish because they rely on similar mechanisms: guilt and shame because both result from transgressing internalized social norms; fear and disgust because both are initially biological instincts meant to protect from harm; guilt and fear because guilt is to some degree a fear of retribution; and shame and disgust because both are elicited by observable deviations from a socially defined ideal.
>
> Each negative emotion can now be associated with its complement: the positive feeling that is supposed to replace it when the norms are optimally followed. For guilt, this is not the “innocence” listed in Muller’s original triangle (which is merely an absence of guilt), but pride, which can be seen as the satisfaction resulting from successfully performing a socially valued action. For shame, the complement is honor, or the public appreciation that you are upholding the norms. For disgust, it is purity, i.e. keeping strictly within the symbolic boundaries. For fear, it is power, which is the situation in which you do not have to fear any punishment, attack or ostracism but rather can instill fear in others." - [Social Systems Programming: Behavioral and Emotional Mechanisms Co-opted for Social Control](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SSP2mechanisms.pdf)

# SECTION: Metamodernism & Recursive Self-Reflection
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "Recursive reflection has directionality. Going meta never means diminishing one’s scope of perspectives, but always increasing it. By definition, it is what allows one to step outside a given frame to see more of the picture... metamodernists see more of the picture than postmodernists (e.g., that grand narratives can be reconstructed according to infinite deconstruction through eternal recursive reflection and critique, and that this itself provides the logic of meaning and value, etc.)... Metamodernism ... is a cultural logic that can reflect on the cultural logic of cultural logics. It reflexively reflects on its capacity to reflexively reflect on reflection.
>
> ... In sum, what “metamodernism” speaks to, I am suggesting, is 1) the cultural moment when the deep recursive process of iterative self-reflection is applied to postmodernism, and thus constitutes an advance beyond the postmodern that includes many of its strategies. In the process, metamodernism becomes 2) the cultural moment when this deep recursive process in cultural shifts becomes an explicit object of reflection and the basis of a new way of seeing. Metamodernism thus becomes a cultural logic about (meta) cultural logics. Thus, with the awareness of the full implications of “going meta” in eternal recursive reflection, metamodernism entails the necessary inclusion within it of all prior cultural logics (at least insofar as it contains representations of their information in its complexity from a higher vantage). In this way, metamodernism signals an inherently multi-perspectival perspective, one that recognizes its inherent ability to toggle in and out of its own recursive contents.
>
> While postmodernism had recognized plurality, metamodernism recognizes the nested nature of this plurality, the Russian doll structure that allows the metamodernist to relate multiple perspectives to each other and to its own vantage. This is what allows it to move beyond the radical relativity and value nihilism of postmodern pluralism, as transcendence returns as a viable and indeed fundamental aspect of reality. Recursive reflection allows the metamodernist to contextualize different contexts by the ordering and relating of perspectives—including the postmodern one.
>
> ... Cultural logics able to master the logic of others by self-recursively applying those logics to themselves to yield new insights reveal themselves as being more critical, more complex, more informationally rich. In short, while there is no absolute standard by which to judge a cultural logic, there is a relative one: namely, How many of the other cultural logics it can nest within its own logic.

> ... With the postmodern perspective now reified like all the rest, it becomes objectified as an available (but not absolute) lens in its arsenal of different lenses. That is, its lens no longer dominates the entire field of vision. Postmodern skepticism and relativism are a way of seeing—and a highly complex one at that—but not the only way. And, indeed, by its ability to take the postmodern relativist view, but then reduplicate its own logic on itself in such a way as to engender a nonrelativistic vantage that relativizes relativism and contextualizes contexts, metamodernism proves its superiority to the less critical, less self-aware lens of the postmodern. Compared to the metamodern, the postmodern is still employing a particular lens uncritically as an absolute and has not yet decentered enough from its perspective to take it as an object. Metamodernism, though, can take postmodernism as an object, getting outside its vantage in a manner that allows it to recursively apply its own logic to it, and thereby produce something new.
>
> In sum, metamodernism reflects a cultural logic of cultural logics. It is the cultural logic in which the recursive reflection driving the advance of cultural logics becomes itself an object of awareness within the cultural logic. It signals the advance to a perspective that can take perspective on the advance of perspectives. It thus regains modern-style directionality and progress, but without its totalizing impulse. For it arises through an eternal self-transcendence to an awareness of eternal self-transcendence that, as soon as it is realized, abolishes its own status among the transcendent by becoming aware that it will be transcended. It thus represents the transcending process becoming aware of itself and, just as soon as it is seen, passes into the immanent, the finite, the untranscended." - [Metamodernism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Cultural Logics, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=With%20the%20postmodern,finite%2C%20the%20untranscended)

> "In the language of complexity science, metamodernism is an “attractor,” a pattern of behavior a system will gravitate towards based on deep structural relationships... It is what is suggested by words like “cultural logic,” “cultural code,” “structure of feeling,” etc. There is a pattern at play... And, as Azarian notes, that pattern rhymes at various levels of analysis. So we see it operating in the arts one minute, in science the next, and so forth. My claim throughout this book is that metamodernism, as a cultural logic, is both a product of that pattern and about it. And the more it unfolds, the more it reveals the pattern, such that the pattern in turn becomes objectified, reflected upon, and eventually contextualized within a still more comprehensive pattern." - [Metamodernism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Cultural Logics, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/chapter-6-worldview-from-metamodernism#:~:text=In%20the%20language,more%20comprehensive%20pattern.)

<details><summary>The effects of sociology on society</summary><p>

> "Let’s come back to Earth for a minute—to the work of very serious sociologists. As early as the 1980s, they were recognizing that they could no longer ignore the effect their own theories were having on, well, society. In a cycle very much like the “observer effect” from quantum physics, sociology influences what it seeks to objectively measure. Theories about culture wind up affecting culture. Recognition of this “double hermeneutic” has led to the emergence of so-called “reflexive sociology”: a discipline for sociologists to study the impact of sociology itself on society.
>
> This is not ivory tower abstraction, but very real stuff. Just think about the revolution in gender norms among members of Gen Z. The very language millions of tweens and teenagers are using to formulate their lived sense of identity comes less and less from their immediate familial or community circle and more and more from academic paradigms that critically reflect upon culture. Eleven-year-olds are coming of age using the paradigms of social constructivism. The postmodern deconstruction of culture is increasingly becoming the means of enculturation itself as younger generations are being socialized via sociology. Just consider that the 2023 summer blockbuster Barbie movie wound up being a fun-for-the-whole-family meta-reflection on issues of patriarchy and feminism.
>
> This is simply itself a reflection, not a judgment, and is in no way intended to echo conservative laments about the loss of childish innocence to those “neo-Marxist postmodernists” spreading their “critical theory” in the schools. But the very fact that such popular jeremiads identify postmodernism itself as a boogeyman that everyone has heard of only underscores the point. Cultural theory is not just in the ivory tower but deeply permeates culture itself." - [Metamodernism, Or, The Cultural Logic of Cultural Logics, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://brendangrahamdempsey.substack.com/p/what-is-metamodernism#:~:text=let%E2%80%99s%20come%20back,permeates%20culture%20itself.)

Foxes, however, are humble servants who will forever deny that they’re in charge. While lions want to run the world, foxes want to save the world.
>
> Because our new elites are foxes and not lions, they no longer feel comfortable celebrating productive habits for the rest of society.
>
> Our old elites used to share a sense of common responsibility and noblesse oblige — not just to give back, but to expect the masses to act in a way that would let them rise up as well. Old elites knew that on average they had more productive habits than the masses (e.g. marital fidelity, two-parent households, steady employment, etc), and so it was thus their job to provide the masses an example to aspire to.
>
> But our new elites are less likely to admit they’re more productive; if anything, they deny it. While this humility seems generous on the surface — it’s nicer to imply that elites are successful solely because of privilege and not also because they’re more productive — this also denies the elites of any responsibility to the masses.
>
> To be sure, new elites do recognize their privilege, but this only necessitates that they give resources, not that they also need to transmit the right habits. So they try to provide a safety net which is great, but they don’t bestow the behaviors that would help the masses best utilize that safety net after they get it.

We pathologize the normal and normalize the pathological. While reversing the direction of stigma may be helpful for the struggling person who can’t change their circumstance, it may also make it harder for the struggling person who can improve their condition to get help.
