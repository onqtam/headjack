> "Instead of the story emerging according to the facts, the facts emerge according to the prevailing story." - [Alexandros Marinos](https://twitter.com/alexandrosM/status/1770219558990938294)

> "News aren’t designed to inform you or to help you make decisions. They’re designed to make money. Best case scenario—which usually means a subscription—they try to inform you in the process. Normally, they pander to keep your subscription alive, which is not always aligned with informing. Worst case scenario—when they live off of ads—they just want you to click on that f****** headline. They also want you to share their articles with somebody else, and they know you’re much more likely to do so if you’re scared, angered, or hear something that sounds very novel or mysterious. So news waste your time because they’re designed to grab your attention, not to inform you." - [How to Consume the News (Don’t), by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/how-to-consume-the-news#:~:text=News%20aren%E2%80%99t%20designed,to%20inform%20you.)

> "We’ve evolved to pay attention to these types of news, but now, in countries of tens of millions of people, they’re mostly irrelevant. Outlets take advantage of your old brain circuits to hijack your attention and convert it into cash. On top of that, most journalists don’t have enough time to create truly insightful content." - [How to Consume the News (Don’t), by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/how-to-consume-the-news#:~:text=We%E2%80%99ve%20evolved%20to,truly%20insightful%20content.)

> "The cynics are people who haven't accomplished much themselves and stand on the sidelines, while criticizing the heroes who are on their fields of battle. They arrogantly pontificate about how those on the field aren't following the cynics' untested and impractical approaches. Cynics also love to point to the mistakes the heroes make, ignoring the reality that all successful people make plenty of mistakes. In the process, they conjure up unrealistic images that heroes must be perfect rather than imperfect but great and much more successful than unsuccessful.
>
> Too many people in the media are opinionated cynics with megaphones, and too few are true journalists trying to report unfolding stories in a balanced way. They have strong preferences to be much more critical than complementary, especially of people who have different inclinations than theirs, often so much so that they will intentionally distort the facts to help create stories of evil people in positions of power. Because their audiences seem to revel in tearing down people in power, that approach also sells well, which rewards them for such behavior." - [Ray Dalio](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4314488-why-no-heroes#:~:text=The%20cynics%20are,for%20such%20behavior.)

> "Some long for the days of the 6pm newscast. This is most certainly a rose-colored view of the past. Those who recall this era remember being soothed by the packaging of the news. In hindsight, what we were watching was not a careful synthesis of fact-checked news but the opinions and interpretations of a small number of people with very limited expertise and even more limited information. It is only events like "Weapons of Mass Destruction" and others recently that have shown the limits of this process in the face of modern information, data, and analysis. I kept asking myself yesterday how different the WMD story would have been had it happened 20 years later. How would a generation of events have unfolded?" - [Steven Sinofsky](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1714709247685263419)

> "Their willingness to edit on the spot and pretend they got it right is insane, and a horrible innovation enabled by web journalism (as opposed to print). They should really be hashing/timestamping articles so they have to commit to their words." - [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1714663896282223098)

> "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities." - [Voltaire](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20527-those-who-can-make-you-believe-absurdities-can-make-you)


> "Lack of truth in most media is one of the vulnerabilities of our society. Besides giving us sensationalized distorted pictures, which leads to bad judgements, it is preventing great leaders from wanting to lead in politics and business." - [Ray Dalio](https://twitter.com/RayDalio/status/999781767312740352)

> "They'll get it all from you sooner or later 'cause they own this f**kin' place. It's a big club and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care. Good, honest, hard-working people: white collar, blue collar, it doesn't matter what color shirt you have on." - [George Carlin](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/543644)

> "Keep in mind, the news media are not independent; they are a sort of bulletin board and public relations firm for the ruling class-the people who run things. Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by, and tolerated purely at the whim of, those who hold economic power. If the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something, it won't be on the news. Period. Or, at the very least, it will be slanted to suit them, and then rarely followed up." - [George Carlin](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/900399)

> "Our media, which is like a planetary nervous system, are far more sensitive to breakdowns than to breakthroughs. They filter out our creativity and successes, considering them less newsworthy than violence, war, and dissent. When we read newspapers and watch television news, we feel closer to a death in the social body than to an awakening." - [Barbara Marx Hubbard](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1175885)

> "When widespread internet access broke down our sense of a collective reality, what it was toppling was not the legacy of the Enlightenment, but instead an approximately 100-year bubble in media centralization." - [The Politics of Epistemic Fragmentation](https://modernmythology.net/the-politics-of-epistemic-fragmentation-175d6bbb98a4#:~:text=When%20widespread%20internet%20access%20broke%20down%20our%20sense%20of%20a%20collective%20reality%2C%20what%20it%20was%20toppling%20was%20not%20the%20legacy%20of%20the%20Enlightenment%2C%20but%20instead%20an%20approximately%20100%2Dyear%20bubble%20in%20media%20centralization.)

[Marc Andreessen](https://twitter.com/pmarca) recently joked in this [interview](https://niccolo.substack.com/p/the-dubrovnik-interviews-marc-andreessen) that it’s really a “marketplace of idea.” The intellectual monoculture was a shock to him, because in a well-functioning marketplace, you’d have differentiated products." - [The Marketplace of Ideas is Rigged, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-marketplace-of-ideas-is-rigged#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20so%20fascinating,have%20differentiated%20products.)

> "Sensemaking is the ability or attempt to make sense of an ambiguous situation. More exactly, sensemaking is the process of creating situational awareness and understanding in situations of high complexity or uncertainty in order to make decisions. It is “a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively." - [Klein](https://thecynefin.co/what-is-sense-making/#:~:text=Sensemaking%20is%20the,and%20act%20effectively)

> "The only way out is through. We need to continue building even deeper and broader understanding of dynamics of narrative, and designing institutions that are structurally incapable of bending their output towards one or another official's preferred narrative. As a simple example, the CDC is currently responsible both for gathering and analyzing information around disease prevalence, and also making policy recommendations. In a narrative-aware world, we'd realize that this creates an irresistible temptation to control the data that is released so that the policy recommendations can seem more correct than they were. In that world those two functions would never be allowed to co-exist in the same organization.
>
> On the individual level, we need to rebuild our sensemaking mechanisms to assume that every piece of information we receive is colored by corrupt incentives, much like we refactored the technology stack of the internet away from the initial naive assumptions and towards security- and encryption-by default. Many areas of human endeavor, such as international diplomancy or even most business-to-business transactions already work on such principles, so it's nowhere near as onerous as it may seem.

> "There are various ways of interpreting Current Things.
>
> A charitable view is that it’s the wisdom of crowds surfacing the most important problems as well as the best ways of solving those problems. 
>
> A less charitable view is that Current Things are “continuous overlapping sequence of emergencies, awakenings and panics, driven by the same interlocking power centers, demanding ever tighter censorship of speech and thought.”
>
> An even less charitable view is that Current Things, paraphrasing Balaji, are the social equivalents of pump and dumps: They are pump and dumps for clicks for the journalists, votes for the politicians, and dollars for the activists. After all, the business model of the press & social media might as well be to cause the reader as much outrage as possible, every day, to cause fear and panic and drive them to come back tomorrow.
>
> These are all interesting observations — that Current Things involve everyone converging onto the same beliefs and that there are profit motives for increasingly surfacing New Current Things — but they undersell the truthiness of The Current Thing.
>
> Current Things always have elements of truth to them, otherwise they wouldn’t capture the world’s imagination. If they didn’t contain at least some kernels of truth, they wouldn't resonate. 
>
> That said, there is also often something “off” about The Current Thing as well. If it were so obviously, incontrovertibly accurate, it wouldn’t go viral, since everyone would be convinced already. There’s no need for evangelism when everyone is already converted. What goes viral is often what creates controversy between groups, where people retweet & quote tweet as a way to claim what side they’re on. If they don’t speak up, their tribal loyalty is questioned. Hence the phrase “silence is violence”.
>
> Additionally, for a moral incident to go viral — for it to be The Current Thing — it has to be super clear-cut. And real-life events usually aren’t that clear-cut. And so the things that tend to go viral are caricatures, with the messy complexity stripped out." - [The Current Thing, Part 1 - How and why it works, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-1#:~:text=There%20are%20various,complexity%20stripped%20out.)

> "Jonathan Haidt, in his book “[The Righteous Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind)” explained the purpose of Current Things when he wrote “Morality binds and blinds.” Current Things bind people together over common beliefs, and they blind people to independent thought outside of the collective, since independent thought can at times be an impediment to group identity. More specifically regarding blindness, people become unwilling to critically analyze the Current Thing if it goes against the belief, precisely because that analysis is a threat to the coherence of the group. When this happens at the group level, this becomes The Madness of Crowds, as opposed to The Wisdom of Crowds, which we usually get when everyone is thinking as a rational individual, not when they are delegating their opinions to the zeitgeist." - [The Current Thing, Part 1 - How and why it works, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-1#:~:text=Jonathan%20Haidt%2C%20in,to%20the%20zeitgeist.)

> "So it seems that two things are true: On the one hand, thanks to the great fragmentation enabled by social media and the explosion of information, we have thousands of bespoke realities and reality entrepreneurs seeking to define them.
>
> On the other hand, thanks to mimetic desire, social psychology, and social media, the mainstream converges to an intellectual monoculture that becomes more and more shrill in its attempt to fight the reality entrepreneurs away.
>
> This is how Current Things encourage ever-increasing levels of rigid lockstep, even as independent media fragments into a thousand diverse intellectual shards." - [The Current Thing, Part 1 - How and why it works, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-1#:~:text=So%20it%20seems,diverse%20intellectual%20shards.)

> "As Martin Gurri chronicled in The Revolt of The Public, after social media suddenly global conversation became two-way instead of one-way. This was a radical shift. If you were living in 1965 and you thought that something was weird with the JFK assassination in 1965, what were you going to do, call somebody and complain? Write a letter to the editor? Good luck getting any attention on that — even if millions of people agreed with you. Whereas today you can instantly spin up a sub-reddit or facebook group or make something go viral on Twitter if it resonates widely. The internet enabled people to research the details of any conspiracy, and share their findings with other people also obsessed with the same experience." - [The Current Thing, Part 2 - Conspiracy theories as Bizarro Current Things, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-2#:~:text=As%20Martin%20Gurri,the%20same%20experience.)

Whereas people who want to be left alone are by definition no good at recruiting or defending their tribe. If you disagree with The Current Thing or The Bizarro Current Thing and you try to convince both sides to moderate, you will have no home and you will get accused of treason by both sides. Non-aggressors will always lose to aggressors. This is why there’s no durable middle. This is why people pick sides. This is why we can’t have nice things." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=Extremists%20will%20always,have%20nice%20things.)

> "Marc Andreessen recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1513720791988330498): is the internet an engine or camera?…Are things actually more stupid today, or were they always stupid and we’re just more aware of the stupidity now?
>
> Of course, Communism and Nazism predated the internet, and those movements were crazier than anything we’re seeing today. People have been taking political sides and forming up mobs and killing scapegoats since….forever.
>
> It seems obvious that the internet is both: It’s a camera that becomes an engine. People act differently in front of the camera—they perform for their tribe, especially when people’s tribal loyalty is in question, as it always is in a society where our tribal bonds are formed over beliefs instead of genetics or geography. And the internet offers the widest camera angle possible—everyone is in the frame 24/7, always at risk of being called out.
>
> And this is why we don’t prioritize rational conversation: We care more about being part of the tribe. Everything makes much more sense when we understand that people are hard-wired to choose a tribe, stick within it, and defend it unconditionally." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=Marc%20Andreessen%20recently,defend%20it%20unconditionally.)

> "Here’s the kicker: the crazier a bonding ideology is—the further away it is from objective reality—the more powerful it is in forming tribes. Why? The crazier the idea, or the crazier the way a person defends their idea, the more it proves their loyalty to the group by shutting off their other available options. Your perceived loyalty increases when you make yourself unsuitable for other tribes because it proves you won’t defect and join them. Until you do that, all tribal attachments are fleeting and contingent.
>
> Consider the phrase, “Abolish the police”, a Current Thing in 2020. Even the people who claimed “Abolish the police” concede that’s not what they truly meant. They meant redirecting police funds to social services and reforming police accountability. But the phrase “Abolish the police” achieves the goal of improving their reputation within their tribe because, by abandoning reasonableness, they are burning the boats to the enemy tribe, demonstrating their in-group loyalty. 
>
> This is also why Abolish the Police was such a textbook Current Thing. “Increased social services for poor people” would have never taken off, nor would “Reform police unions”. People have been trying to get attention to those topics for decades. Only something crazy, but with a kernel of truth, could get such wide attention.
>
> To reiterate: The Current Thing is sometimes true, but it certainly isn't run by the scientific method, it's run by high school politics. People are often vessels looking for a hit. They don’t really care where they get it; they only care that it’s good." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20the%20kicker,that%20it%E2%80%99s%20good.)

They are optimized for fitness, or in this case, going viral." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=Current%20Things%20may%20be%20true%2C%20but%20they%20are%20not%20optimized%20for%20truth.%20They%20are%20optimized%20for%20fitness%2C%20or%20in%20this%20case%2C%20going%20viral.)

> "In fact, some ideas are so “fit” that evidence asserting their falsity won’t debunk them. People are so incentivized to believe them that they keep believing in them in spite of evidence to the contrary. Religion, communism, and fascism are common examples. If you expect these to go away via the marketplace of ideas, you're going to be waiting for a long time." - [The Current Thing, Part 3 - Why Current Things are impervious to rational conversation, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/the-current-thing-part-3#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20some,a%20long%20time.)

> "Under [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), everyone is irresistibly incentivized to ignore the things that unite us in favor of forever picking at the things that divide us in exactly the way that is most likely to make them more divisive. Race relations are at historic lows not because white people and black people disagree on very much, but because the media absolutely worked its tuchus off to find the single issue that white people and black people disagreed over the most and ensure that it was the only issue anybody would talk about. Men’s rights activists and feminists hate each other not because there’s a huge divide in how people of different genders think, but because only the most extreme examples of either side will ever gain traction, and those only when they are framed as attacks on the other side.
>
> People talk about the shift from old print-based journalism to the new world of social media and the sites adapted to serve it. These are fast, responsive, and only just beginning to discover the power of controversy. They are memetic evolution shot into hyperdrive, and the omega point is a well-tuned machine optimized to search the world for the most controversial and counterproductive issues, then make sure no one can talk about anything else. An engine that creates money by burning the few remaining shreds of cooperation, bipartisanship and social trust.
>
> Imagine Moloch looking out over the expanse of the world, eagle-eyed for anything that can turn brother against brother and husband against wife. Finally he decides “YOU KNOW WHAT NOBODY HATES EACH OTHER ABOUT YET? BIRD-WATCHING. LET ME FIND SOME STORY THAT WILL MAKE PEOPLE HATE EACH OTHER OVER BIRD-WATCHING”. And the next day half the world’s newspaper headlines are “Has The Political Correctness Police Taken Over Bird-Watching?” and the other half are “Is Bird-Watching Racist?”. And then bird-watchers and non-bird-watchers and different sub-groups of bird-watchers hold vitriolic attacks on each other that feed back on each other in a vicious cycle for the next six months, and the whole thing ends in mutual death threats and another previously innocent activity turning into World War I style trench warfare." - [The Toxoplasma Of Rage, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/#:~:text=Under%20Moloch%2C%20everyone,style%20trench%20warfare.)

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country... We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society... In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

> "The television commercial is not at all about the character of products to be consumed. It is about the character of the consumers of products." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/39392-the-television-commercial-is-not-at-all-about-the-character)

> "By bringing together in compact form all the arts of show business-music, drama, imagery, humor, celebrity-the television commercial has mounted the most serious assault on capitalist ideology since the publication of Das Kapital. To understand why, we must remind ourtselves that capitalism, like science and liberal democracy, was an outgrowth of the Enlightenment. Its principal theorists, even its most prosperous practitioners, believed capitalism to be based on the idea that both buyer and seller are sufficiently mature, well informed and reasonable to engage in transactions of mutual self-interest." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11011375-by-bringing-together-in-compact-form-all-the-arts-of)

> "It is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcotized by technological diversions." - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/817099-it-is-not-necessary-to-conceal-anything-from-a-public)

> "Television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation. I am using this world almost in the precise sense in which it is used by spies in the CIA or KGB. Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information--misplace, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information--information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result. And in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?" - [Neil Postman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/685783-in-america-everyone-is-entitled-to-an-opinion-and-it#:~:text=television%20is%20altering,to%20be%20knowledge%3F)
