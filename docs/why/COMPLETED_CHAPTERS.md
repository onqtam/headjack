> "'Debate-checking' is the logical end of 'fact-checking.' If you are 'proving' one fact/premise/argument at a time, it's essentially cherry-picking. If you are searching for truth, it needs to be conducted in a manner that's maximizing the context of the inquiry space, so relevant arguments, counterarguments, evidence, etc. can be assessed holistically. Once you have done the work of debate mapping, it's very easy to see how one piece of knowledge can completely change the likely veracity and relevance of another piece of knowledge." - [Jamie Joyce](https://twitter.com/JustJamieJoyce/status/1775303902814220342)

# SECTION: Consciousness
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.
>
> ...It serves as a central information exchange, rather than a locus of cognition itself, enabling different specialized brain networks to interact and supporting integrated and adaptive responses." - [Global workspace theory, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory#:~:text=GWT%20analogizes%20the,and%20adaptive%20responses.)

https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm
https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Tyranny_of_Structurelessness
Excerpts
"Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a 'structureless' group. Any group of people of whatever nature coming together for any length of time, for any purpose, will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible, it may vary over time, it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities and intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals with different talents, predispositions and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate 'structurelessness' and that is not the nature of a human group.

...

Principles of Democratic Structuring
- Delegation of specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks by default only means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot easily be ignored.
-  Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be responsible to all those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has the ultimate say over how the power is exercised.
- Distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people an opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn specific skills.
- Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person's 'property' and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well and acquire a sense of satisfaction of doing a good job.
- Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group, or giving them hard work because they are disliked, serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of 'apprenticeship' programme rather than the 'sink or swim' method. Having a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralising. Conversely, being blackballed from what one can do well does not encourage one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being competent throughout most of human history: the movement does not need to repeat this process.
- Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion without the group participating. The more one knows abouthow things work, the more politically effective one can be.
- Equal access to resources needed by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press or a darkroom owned by a husband) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills and information can be equally available only when members are willing to teach what they know to others.
When these principles are applied, they ensure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and be responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it."

# SECTION: Hierarchy / holacracy / subsidiarity
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution." - [Subsidiarity, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiarity#:~:text=Subsidiarity%20is%20a%20principle%20of%20social%20organization%20that%20holds%20that%20social%20and%20political%20issues%20should%20be%20dealt%20with%20at%20the%20most%20immediate%20or%20local%20level%20that%20is%20consistent%20with%20their%20resolution.)

> "Wherever we find orderly, stable systems in Nature, we find that they are hierarchically structured, for the simple reason that without such structuring of complex systems into sub-assemblies, there could be no order and stability-except the order of a dead universe filled with a uniformly distributed gas." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652997-wherever-we-find-orderly-stable-systems-in-nature-we-find)

> "On successively higher levels of the hierarchy we find more complex, flexible and less predictable patterns of activity, while on successively lower levels we find more and more mechanised, stereotyped and predictable patterns. In the language of the physicist, a holon on a higher level of the hierarchy has more degrees of freedom than a holon on a lower level." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9653378-on-successively-higher-levels-of-the-hierarchy-we-find-more)

> "The self-assertive tendency is the dynamic expression of the holon's wholeness, the integrative tendency, the dynamic expression of its partness." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652981-no-man-is-an-island-he-is-a-holon-a-janus-faced#:~:text=the%20self%2Dassertive%20tendency%20is%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20the%20holon%27s%20wholeness%2C%20the%20integrative%20tendency%2C%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20its%20partness.)

> "[Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) provides a governance framework that is decidedly [holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) — roughly, systems within systems. In this way, a holacratic organization approximates a living organism as opposed to a machine to be “designed” or “run.” Practitioners aren’t arranged by managers as cogs within a traditional org chart, but rather define their own functional roles within wider spheres of activity, or “circles.”
>
> Just as cells make up organs within organisms, people have roles within teams within organizations. And though certain cells and roles might hustle themselves into an “executive function,” both the organism’s and the holacratic organization’s brains are self-organizing." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Holacracy%20provides%20a,are%20self%2Dorganizing.)

> "Holacracy makes an organization a complex adaptive system. Unlike command-and-control hierarchies, complex adaptive organizations respond with relative autonomy to stimuli that are, for lack of a better way of putting things, not quite right. Practitioners call these “tensions.” Every part of the organization wants to get things flowing, [following constructal theorist Adrian Bejan](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/the-law-of-flow-is-everywhere. To resolve tensions is to get things flowing — that is, towards realizing the mission. At the risk of oversimplification, let’s break it down:
>
> - Mission. This is why the organization exists and is the end all roles serve. (Because large-scale societies don’t have missions, decentralization is vital.)
>
> - Holacracy Constitution. Sets out the relatively fixed protocols and rules that compose Holacracy’s open-source social operating system.
>
> - Tactical Meetings. A group process for addressing one-off, operational issues in a formalized way, relevant to some functional sphere of activity.
>
> - Governance Meetings. A group process for creating roles, making policies, or assigning ownership of responsibilities.
>
> - Information management. The inputs and output of circle meetings are recorded so anyone can see the rules, roles, and policies at any time." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied)

> "With the holonic structure of circles within circles, we can imagine a greater encompassing supercircle composed of members of lower-order circles. This is an abstract way of describing something similar to a subsidiarity rule, which means decision-making authority should be devolved to the most local feasible level. Holacracy holds the promise of emergent subsidiarity." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=With%20the%20holonic,of%20emergent%20subsidiarity.)

> "Anarchy comes from the greek “an”, meaning without, plus “arkhos”, meaning rulers. Anarchy doesn’t mean without rules, but without rulers. If you have the right rules, the absence of top-down rulers doesn’t remove order — it simply enables order to emerge dynamically from peer-to-peer interactions distributed throughout a system, one tension at a time. So by this definition, you could describe Holacracy as a rule system for humans working together in anarchy — with rules, but without rulers." - [Brian Robertson](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Anarchy%20comes%20from%20the%20greek,with%20rules%2C%20but%20without%20rulers.)

> "Many founders don’t want employees following their orders. They want a team of leaders stepping up and taking a piece of this organization with autonomy and self-direction." - [Brian Robertson](https://www.holacracy.org/#:~:text=Many%20founders%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20employees%20following%20their%20orders.%20They%20want%20a%20team%20of%20leaders%20stepping%20up%20and%20taking%20a%20piece%20of%20this%20organization%20with%20autonomy%20and%20self%2Ddirection.)

> "A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole. In this way, a holon can be considered a subsystem within a larger hierarchical system. The holon represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes, as well as a way to account for both the self-assertive and the integrative tendencies of organisms." - [Holon, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)#Holarchy:~:text=A%20holon%20is,of%20organisms.)

> "A holarchy is composed of [holons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part. Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts." - [Holacracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy#:~:text=a%20holarchy%20is,as%20dependent%20parts.)

> "- Roles instead of job descriptions: The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform. Roles are defined by each circle—or team—via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.
>
> - Circle structure: Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization's mission and strategy.
>
> - Governance process: Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.
>
> - Operational process: Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams according to operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together. There are also key roles to help organise the process and workflow of each circle including Facilitator, Secretary, Lead Link, and Rep Link.
>
> In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.) Holacracy is highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental." - [Holacracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy#:~:text=Roles%20instead%20of,to%20be%20detrimental.)

Random drift can lead to the takeover of the neutral mutant. Or, in other words, if birds go to an island where there are no predators, they lose their ability to fly. A biological trait, to be evolutionary stable, must be under selection. The retaliation, sometimes retaliation against defection goes out if nobody's trying to defect. So you've got to always cooperate by random drift. But if we'd always cooperate, now we can guess what happens next: we invite Always defect. You have oscillations here, you have a mathematical model of human history, of economic cycles, of ups and downs.
>
> There is one thing that I have learned in my studies of cooperation over the last 20 years: there is no equilibrium. There is never a stable equilibrium. Cooperation is always being destroyed and has to be rebuilt. How much time you spend on average in a cooperative state depends on how quickly you can rebuild it. The most important aspect is really how quickly you can get away from the Always defect again." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=If%20everybody%20here,Always%20defect%20again.)

> We know how this works from the way evaluations work on E-Bay. For example, you make a deal, you get a good evaluation, your value goes up. We have also played experimental games where people can purchase reputation, they can trade reputation if they have good reputation, so we can actually determine the price of a good reputation in experimental situations. This indirect reciprocity relies on gossip; some people might have an interaction and others observe it, and others talk about it. We are obsessed with gossip. We are obsessed with talking about others and how it would be to interact with them...

And I find this beautiful because there is a lot in a face. A lot can be read from facial features.

Neighbors form clusters, or you and your friends have many interactions and you cooperate, and you can even be an unconditional cooperator with your friends, and that can work out. This is an evolutionary graph theory where you have a social network and people interact with others on the graph. More recently, we also developed more a powerful mathematical approach that we call evolutionary set theory, where you belong to certain sets, for example, the Mathematics Department, the Biology Department, Harvard, or MIT, or the gym, or the tennis club, and I interact with people in that set. I cooperate with the people in the set and I try to join sets of successful individuals. So the extension to classical evolutionary game theory here is in classic evolutionary game theory, people imitate successful strategies. Here they imitate successful strategies in successful locations. They want to move into successful locations, and that can give rise to this clustering that allows evolution of cooperation." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=Spatial%20selection%20is,evolution%20of%20cooperation.)

> "What I find very interesting in these games of conditional reciprocity, direct and indirect reciprocity, we can make the point that winning strategies have the following three properties: they must be generous, hopeful and forgiving.
>
> Generous in the following sense: if I have a new interaction, now I realize (and this is I think where most people go wrong) that this is not a game where it's either the other person or me who is winning. Most of our interactions are not like a tennis game in the US Open where one person loses and one person goes to the next round. Most of our interactions are more like let us share the pie and I'm happy to get 49 percent, but the pie is not destroyed. I'm willing to make a deal, and sometimes I accept less than 50 percent. The worst outcome would be to have no deal at all. So in that sense, generous means I never try to get more than the other person. Tit-for-tat never wins in any single encounter; neither does Generous Tit-for-tat.

That social norm itself should be the product of evolution, and that's something that nobody has really described yet because that's usually a given in a group.

> "In other words, cooperation in groups on a genetic basis tends to be self-destructive. This may be clarified by introducing the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy. The strategy of the altruists, helping others even if they do not reciprocate the help, may lead to an increased fitness for the group but it is not stable, since it can be easily invaded by egoistic strategies that take advantage of the altruists' sacrifice, but without giving anything in return. Though the selfish strategies will globally lead to a decrease of fitness for the group, they are locally stronger than the altruist strategies. This is another expression of the principle of suboptimization: genetic evolution works at the level of the subsystem (the individual or the individual together with his kin), and what is optimal at that level will be selected, even though it is far from optimal at the level of the group. Campbell has summed up this predicament by the phrase "genetic competition among the cooperators": on the level of the genes rivalry continues, and that will eventually erode any cooperation on the level of the group." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Selection for reciprocal altruism
>
> The characteristics of "tit for tat" (and of the other more successful strategies) can be summarized by three concepts: 1) the strategy is "nice": this means that it will never be the first to defect; 2) the strategy is "provocable": if the opponent defects, it retaliates by defecting too; 3) the strategy is "forgiving": as soon as the opponent cooperates again, the strategy forgets about the previous defection, and cooperates.
>
> Niceness is advantageous because it opens the way to mutually beneficial cooperation. Retaliation is necessary in order to avoid being invaded by selfish profiteers. Forgivingness has the advantage of avoiding mutual rounds of retaliation. Indeed, suppose that an individual because of distrust, by way of test or just because of a misunderstanding would defect just once, then a non- forgiving strategy would continue to defect in reaction, and mutual cooperation could never emerge or be restored.
>
> In a second study Axelrod generalized his game theoretic simulation to an evolutionary setting. In this setting, fitness was explicitly introduced by giving a strategy an amount of offspring proportional to the number of points it got in the previous tournament. The tournament was then repeated by playing all members of the new population of strategies (in which more successful strategies were now more numerous) against each other. Again the points of this tournament were used to produce a second generation of offspring. This generation played a following tournament, and so on. After many generations the less successful strategies would have been eliminated by natural selection, while the most successful ones would become more and more numerous. This setting is not equivalent to the previous one, since the fitness of the strategies depends on the opponents against which they play, and the field of opponents changes in the course of the simulated evolution. Hence a strategy that is successful in the original field of opponents may no longer be fit after the field has drastically changed. Yet Axelrod found out that it was still "tit for tat" that was most successful.
>
> However, "tit for tat" does not turn out to be an evolutionary stable strategy in the strict sense. Indeed, once the field is dominated by "tit for tat", other strategies that are less retaliatory (or more forgiving) become as fit as "tit for tat" since there are no longer cheaters to take advantage from their unconditional altruism. However, once a sufficient percentage of strategies becomes too altruistic, selfish strategies can again gain in fitness by exploiting their altruism. The end result seems to be some kind of equilibrium mixture of strategies in which reciprocal altruists such as "tit for tat" dominate, but in which there may also appear small amounts of "nasty" (the opposite of "nice") strategies together with non-retaliating altruists.
>
> In how far can these simulation results be generalized to real evolution? The most important restriction in the experiment seems to be that opponents interact with each other for a long, consecutive sequence of exchanges. This may be true for two individuals engaged in a close and stable relation. Reciprocal altruism may thus explain how a symbiotic relationship between two organisms can develop (e.g. a hermit crab and the sea anemone living on its shell) (cf. Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). In the kind of situations involving a large number of individuals that interest us, on the other hand, it seems more likely that opponents will encounter each other only once, or now and then with long interruptions and exchanges with different opponents in between.
>
> "Tit for tat" is only successful in an indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. If there is only one transaction, no retaliation is possible afterwards, and rationality dictates that you should defect. If there is a finite number of transactions, it pays to defect during the last one, but if you expect your opponent to defect at the last one, you should also defect at the last-but-one, and hence your opponent would be wise to already defect at the last-but-two, and so on. Hence games with a fixed number (known by the participants) of transactions would lead to continuous defection. In practice, that does not seem to be the problem, since normally opponents do not know how often they will meet each other again.
>
> However, the basic practical limitation is that of memory: the reciprocal altruist should not only remember how his opponent treated him during the last transaction (which may be a long time ago) he should also be able to recognize and distinguish all opponents with whom he has ever had transactions. This requirement does not seem to be realistic in large groups, such as human societies. Moreover, in such large systems, many encounters will take place for the first (and perhaps the last) time. In such cases reciprocal altruism does no good, and the "nice" individual who starts by cooperating may be cheated most of the time by others he will never see again. When I buy something in a shop in a city where I will never come back again, I do not expect to be cheated (though that is possible of course), even though I have no power to retaliate. In conclusion, reciprocal altruism seems still insufficient to explain the ultrasociality of human society." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The basic weakness of reciprocal altruism in explaining ultrasociality is that it starts from dyadic relationships, of the type "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine". It is difficult to imagine how such one-to-one exchanges could be enlarged in order to form the basis for large collective organizations. Therefore we would like to see some evolutionary stable strategy that directs behaviour towards groups rather than towards other individuals.
>
> It has been proposed that one such strategy is moralism, that is to say behavior that rewards or reinforces altruistic behavior by others, and punishes or inhibits cheating or defection. For example, Trivers (1971) has postulated selection for "moralistic aggression", and Lorenz (1975) speaks about "innate ethical sense". The advantage of moralism compared to pure altruism is that the costs of moralizing towards others are clearly less than those of being altruistic yourself (Campbell, 1983). However, if everybody around you is continuously moralizing, and ready to ostracize or even kill you if you do not behave altruistically, it becomes quite difficult to behave in a selfish way. Hence groups consisting of moralizing individuals will also tend to be altruistic, though the individuals are not motivated to be altruistic on their own. Moralism is also more stable than real altruism because cheaters will find it very difficult to invade a population that tends to make their life as difficult as possible. A disadvantage of moralism is that it encourages hypocrisy, that is to say behavior that does everything to look altruistic but is in fact selfish.
>
> A basic weakness of the argument is that it is difficult to imagine how something as complicated as an "ethical sense" might develop through genetic evolution. It seems quite difficult to put down rules distinguishing moral or altruistic behavior from selfish behavior that are applicable to all situations and all individuals. We might perhaps imagine the evolution of simple behavior patterns such as aggressive reactions against the selfish wolf who does not want the others of the pack to share in the food, but that does not seem sufficient to explain ultrasociality.
>
> Another weakness of the moralistic selection argument, is that moralism mainly functions to maintain an already functioning cooperation system, by reducing the fitness of those who do not obey the rules. However, the argument does not explain how the cooperative pattern, and the moralistic attitude that maintains it, may have developed from selfish behavior in the first place." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The theory of natural selection on the basis of fitness is in principle applicable to all replicating systems, not only to genes. Recently, a new type of replicator has been proposed as a unit of cultural evolution. Memes are defined as cognitive or behavioral patterns that can be transmitted from one individual to another one by learning and imitation (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz, 1991). Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society, almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language, fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts, conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any replication at the level of the genes. Storing a concept or a habit in memory after having encountered it through another individual, does not require any change of the DNA." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Though that process will be subjected to the same basic principles of blind variation and natural selection on the basis of fitness, memetic evolution is basically a much more flexible mechanism. Genes can only be transmitted from parents (or parent in the case of asexual reproduction) to offspring. Memes can in principle be transmitted between any two individuals (though it will become more difficult the larger the differences in cognitive mechanisms and language are).
>
> For genes to be transmitted, you typically need one generation, which for higher organism means several years. Memes can be transmitted in the space of hours. Meme spreading is also much faster than gene spreading, because gene replication is restricted by the rather small number of offspring a single parent can have, whereas the amount of individuals that can take over a meme from a single individual is almost unlimited. Moreover, it seems much easier for memes to undergo variation, since the information in the nervous system is more plastic than that in the DNA, and since individuals can come into contact with much more different sources of novel memes. On the other hand, selection processes can be more efficient because of "vicarious" selection: the meme carrier himself does not need to be killed in order to eliminate an inadequate meme; it can suffice that he witnesses or hears about the troubles of another individual due to that same meme.
>
> The conclusion is that memetic evolution will be several orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than genetic evolution. It should not surprise us then that during the last ten thousand years, humans have almost not changed on the genetic level, whereas their culture (i.e. the total set of memes) has undergone the most radical developments. In practice the superior "evolvability" of memes would also mean that in cases where genetic and memetic replicators are in competition, we would expect the memes to win in the long term, even though the genes would start with the advantage of a well- established, stable structure." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Meme fitness will depend basically on three factors: 1) survivability of the carrier; 2) individual learnability of memes; 3) tendency of memes to spread or to be transmitted. The first criterion is similar to the one determining gene selection, so we won't go into much detail about it. Basically it states that, all other things being equal, memes leading to decreased probability of a carrier's survival, e.g. because they are bad for the health, or lead to dangerous or suicidal behavior, will tend to be eliminated. However, we must add that survival is to be interpreted on the level of the group of all carriers, rather than on the level of the individual." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is this contagiousness that most strikingly differentiates meme selection from gene selection. Genes, indeed, are not contagious. You can never get a gene, that you did not already have, from someone else. At most you can produce a child that shares some of your genes with some genes of another person." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "All memes have the implicit goal of making their carriers more fit, since an increased number of carriers signifies that there will be more memory space available for meme replication. If, as we have argued previously, cooperation among the carriers tends to increase the overall fitness of the group of carriers, it will be in the interest of memes to promote that cooperation. Moreover, since cooperation requires communication, and since meme spreading critically depends on communication, the "motivation" of memes to bolster cooperation should be even stronger than that of genes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The selective advantage does not mean that the less fit group will be physically eliminated during the competition with the cooperative group. On the level of memes, elimination can happen when the selfish group gives up its belief in the meme for selfishness and adopts the meme for altruism from the other group. This conversion of one group by another one may happen by direct physical force, for example because the altruist group is better organized to win a war between the groups, and can thus subdue the other one. It can also happen in a peaceful way because the less successful group simply imitates the more successful one.
>
> The basic argument against group selection is that group strategies can be easily invaded. However, that is not the case for memetic strategies. Indeed, suppose that a "mutant" meme promoting selfishness would appear in an altruist group. According to genetic reasoning, its carrier would be more fit than an altruist one, since he can profit from the altruism of the other carriers without paying the corresponding costs. However, the fitness of a meme is different from the fitness of its carrier. Though the selfish carrier might have enhanced fitness in the sense that he gets more food or other resources, the fitness of the meme he carries depends on how easily other members of the group can be converted to it.
>
> Now memes are selfish, which means that they have the implicit goal of thwarting all rival memes that compete for the same memory space. Hence the majority meme in the group will tend to consolidate the memory space it already occupies in the majority of carriers. A likely mechanism for that might be that the different carriers continuously reinforce each other's belief by communication and imitation. The carrier of the mutant meme, on the other hand, is alone and does not get any reinforcement from his fellows. He will find it very difficult to convert any of them to his non-conformist ideas, since the influence on any individual of a majority of conformists will be much stronger than that of a single dissident. This tendency of the majority meme to impose itself on minorities leads to intra-group homogeneity, as confirmed by Boyd and Richerson's (1985) mathematical model of cultural evolution" - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Memes will even succeed in transcending the problem of the genetic competition between the cooperators... Our criticism of the argument on the basis of moralism, namely that a complete ethical system seems too complex to evolve by genetic selection, does not apply to memetic evolution, which is much faster, and which adapts more readily to abstract models of the world." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "When two individuals, after sufficient interactions, have reached a stable cooperative relationship or pact, based on reciprocity, that agreement or convention can be viewed as a meme with two carriers. If there is communication, that same meme can be transferred to a third and a fourth carrier, and so on, who would thus come to join the convention. Indeed, an individual who observes an existing reciprocal relationship between two other individuals, and who notices the advantages following from their mutual cooperation, would be tempted to imitate their behavior. If a certain behavioral pattern tends to be imitated, that makes it a meme by definition. If that meme, in addition to it being contagious, also furthers the genetic fitness of its carriers, we may conclude that it has a high memetic fitness, and thus will tend to replace rival memes with a lower fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The limitations on memory that make reciprocity difficult for large groups, can also be evaded by memetic mechanisms. Indeed, a meme can easily evolve mechanisms for making members of the same cultural group easy to recognize. Individuals belonging to the same culture or ethnical group will usually distinguish themselves by clearly perceivable attributes or behavior... If such signs allow you to identify a member of your group, you can expect that he will also follow the group's agreement on reciprocity, and hence you can trust that he will cooperate, without you having to renegotiate a pact. If he does not, you can still alarm the other members of your group, and he will be subjected to moralistic aggression. In that sense it is to the advantage of both the group and separate individuals to wear the appropriate attributes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Many ethical systems explicitly refer to the ideal of "fraternity", and sometimes members of the same cultural group (e.g. monks or Freemasons) are supposed to call each other "brother". Though these are not brothers in the biological sense, the meme attempts to harness the innate tendency to behave altruistically towards kin and to use it for purposes different from the increase of genetic inclusive fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is possible to discern a clear progression from pure selfishness, to kin-restricted limited altruism, to "tit for tat" based dyads, to multi-individual reciprocal agreements, to moralism and group ideologies, and finally to the complex ultrasocial systems of cooperation characterizing present society." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "With the capacity for language appears the capacity to rapidly spread complex memes, and that gives memes a definite advantage over genes in directing further evolution. In recent times, the memes that seem to be dominating are those that tend to make the ideal of altruism or brotherliness universal, ignoring the distinctions created by older memes such as languages or religions. We will not go into detail about why that is happening but note that the evolutionary tendency towards more and more far-reaching or inclusive cooperation seems to continue, albeit with many ups and downs. Such an evolution towards stronger integration of subsystems, allowing optimization at the global level, is exemplified by Turchin's concept of a metasystem transition. Such an evolutionary transition is characterized by the appearance of a control system at the metalevel, steering and optimizing the actions of the subsystems at the level below." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "A basic conclusion of our general analysis is that you need communication before you can have cooperation, that is to say information must be shared. In organisms cooperating because of kin selection, the medium of communication is sexual reproduction: genetic "messages" are transmitted through special cells (sperm or egg cells) that cannot survive or develop independently of the process of sexual reproduction. It is this shared information that creates the connection between parents and offspring or, indirectly, between relatives. In primitive multicellular organisms, such as algae, the "communication" might be based on simple spatial contiguity (sharing of the same location). In complex organisms where there is differentiation of functions among cells, you need special chemical signals to coordinate the different cells (this can be modelled by "genetic networks", Kauffmann, 1991). In sociocultural systems, the basic medium supporting cooperation is meme spreading." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The complete evolutionary sequence would be something of the following form: competition, communication, stable interaction patterns, internal models of pattern, shared models, shared replicators, cooperation promoted by shared replicators, integration with the shared replicators as coordinators. In Turchin's terminology, the shared information will become a control for the systems of the level below, coordinating, monitoring and directing their cooperation. Hence the process of development of cooperation between initially competing subsystems through the development of shared replicators can be seen as a true metasystem transition." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is clear that the whole issue of how competing subsystems can start to cooperate and thus become (partly or completely) integrated into a globally optimizing supersystem is very complex. Many questions about cooperation, shared information, and higher levels of control still have to be answered. Yet I think it is equally obvious that these problems are of the utmost importance if we wish to understand our own further evolution, as individuals, as a species, as a culture, or as parts of the global world system." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

Successful cooperation, Axelrod argued, required that people start off by being nice—that is, by being willing to cooperate—but that they had to be willing to punish noncooperative behavior as soon as it appeared.

Then they offered people the opportunity to punish the free riders. For the price of a third of a token, you could take one token away from the free rider. Two things happened as a result. First, people spent money to punish the evildoers—even though, again, it was economically irrational for them to do so. Second, the free riders shaped up and started contributing their fair share. in fact, even during the last rounds of these games, when there was no reason to keep contributing (since no punishment could be inflicted), people continued to chip in." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://wisdomofcrowds.blogspot.com/2011/01/chapter-six-part-vii.html#:~:text=Fehr%20and%20G%C3%A4chter%20tweaked,continued%20to%20chip%20in.)

> "The coin of the realm, for most scientists, is not cash but rather recognition. Even so, scientists are undoubtedly as self-seeking and as self-interested as the rest of us. The genius of the way science is organized, though, makes their self-interested behavior redound to the benefits of all of us. In the process of winning notoriety for themselves, they make the group – that is, the scientific community and then, indirectly, the rest of us – smarter." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-review-wisdom-of-crowds-by-james.html#:~:text=The%20coin%20of,of%20us%20%E2%80%93%20smarter.)

> "Pursuing their own self-interest is more complicated for scientists than it might sound. While scientists are fundamentally competing for recognition and attention, that recognition and attention can only be afforded them by the very people they're competing against. So science presents us with the curious paradox of an enterprise that is simultaneously intensely competitive and intensely cooperative. The quest for recognition ensures a steady infusion of diverse thought, since no one becomes famous for restating what's already known. (This makes it less important that scientists tend to be interested in what other scientists are interested in, since the quest for originality forces researchers to think past convention.) And the competition also works to provide an inherent check on flawed ideas, since, as the philosopher David Hull has argued, showing the flaws in other people's work is one way to make a name for yourself. But all that competition depends on a given level of cooperation, because it's the rare scientist who can flourish in isolation from the work of his peers. What allows this strange blend of collaboration and competition to flourish is the scientific ethos that demands open access to information. This ethos dates back to the origins of the scientific revolution in the seventeenth century. In 1665, the Royal Society— one of the first institutions, and certainly the most important, formed to foster the growth of scientific knowledge—published the first issue of its Philosophical Transactions. It was a seminal moment in the history of science, because of the journal's fierce commitment to the idea that all new discoveries should be disseminated as widely and freely as possible. Henry Oldenburg, the first secretary of the Royal Society and the editor of the Transactions, pioneered the idea that secrecy was inimical to scientific progress, and convinced scientists that they should give up their sole ownership of their ideas in exchange for the recognition they would receive as the creator or discoverer of those ideas. What Oldenburg grasped was the peculiar character of knowledge, which does not, unlike other commodities, get used up as it is consumed and which can be therefore spread widely without losing its value. If anything, in fact, the more a piece of knowledge becomes available, the more valuable it potentially becomes, because of the wider array of possible uses for it. As a result, the historian Joel Mokyr writes, the scientific revolution became the period "in which 'open science' emerged, when knowledge about the natural world became increasingly nonproprietary and scientific advances and discoveries were freely shared with the public at large. Thus scientific knowledge became a public good, communicated freely rather than confined to a secretive exclusive few as had been the custom in medieval Europe." This tradition of open publication and communication of insights was, of course, central to the success of Western science. It's open science that made the self-interested behavior of scientists collectively beneficial. Scientists were willing to publish their insights because that was the route to public recognition and influence. If one wanted to think about this process in market terms—as some have tried to do—you could say that scientists were paid by other people's attention. As the sociologist of science Robert K. Merton famously put it, "In science, one's private property is established by giving its substance away." The challenge the scientific community faces today is whether the success of Western science can survive the growing commercialization of scientific endeavors. Science and commerce have, of course, been intertwined for centuries. But as an increasing share of scientific research and development is funded by corporations, which see themselves as having an economic interest in protecting information rather than in disseminating it widely, the nature of scientific exchange may change. The sociologist Warren Hagstrom talked about science as a "gift economy" rather than an exchange economy. And the idea of science as made up of "invisible colleges" of researchers bound by their common interest in expanding knowledge, if perhaps naive, still has a powerful hold not just on laypeople but on scientists themselves. Corporations, on the other hand, are generally not gift givers nor do they thrive on collegiality. The fact that public funding is still instrumental to science, and particularly to basic research, insulates scientists to some extent from commercial pressures. And although the patent system limits what others can do with a given invention, it also—by requiring the inventor to publish the details of his invention in order to get a patent—plays a role in continuing to fuel the free flow of information. But the conflict between science and business is not imaginary. The spectacle of companies funding studies and then demanding that they be suppressed when the results do not come back to their satisfaction is not something that would have pleased Henry Oldenburg. TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR in terms of the quest for recognition may make it sound as if scientists were simply fame hounds (which, of course, some of them are). But recognition is not, at least in theory, about celebrity or fashion. Recognition is instead the proper reward for genuinely new and interesting discoveries. Scientists want to be recognized because it's nice to be recognized. But they also want to be recognized because recognition is what allows new ideas to be incorporated into the general body of scientific knowledge. What's intriguing about science from the perspective of collective problem solving is that it is the community as a whole that bestows the recognition, which is to say that it's the community as a whole that decides whether or not a scientific hypothesis is true and whether it's original. This doesn't mean that scientific truth is in the eye of the beholder. The coronavirus caused SARS before the WHO announced that the coronavirus caused SARS. But in scientific terms, the coronavirus only became the cause of SARS once other scientists had scrutinized the work of the labs and accepted it as proving what they said it proved." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Pursuing%20their%20own,said%20it%20proved.)

> "UNFORTUNATELY, THERE is SOMETHING of a flaw in this idealized picture of the way the scientific community discovers truth. And the flaw is that most scientific work never gets noticed. Study after study has shown that most scientific papers are read by almost no one, while a small number of papers are read by many people. Famous scientists find their work cited vastly more often than scientists who are less well known." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=UNFORTUNATELY%2C%20THERE%20is,less%20well%20known.)

> "Why does polarization occur? One reason is because of people's reliance on "social comparison." This means more than that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else (which, of course, they are). It means that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else with an eye toward maintaining their relative position within the group. In other words, if you start out in the middle of the group and you believe the group has moved, as it were, to the right, you're inclined to shift your position to the right as well, so that relative to everyone else you're standing still. Of course, by moving to the right you're moving the group to the right, making social comparison something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. What's assumed to be real eventually becomes real. It's important to see, though, that polarization isn't just the result of people trying to stay in tune with the group. It also results, strangely, from people doing their best to figure out what the right answer is. As we saw in our discussion of social proof—remember the passersby who ended up staring into an empty sky—people who are uncertain about what they believe will look to other members of the group for help. That's the point of deliberating, after all. But if a majority of the group already supports one position, then most of the arguments that will be made will be in support of that position. So the uncertain people are likely to be swayed in that direction, in part simply because that's more of what they'll hear. Similarly, people who have more extreme positions are more likely to have strong, coherent arguments in favor of their positions and are also more likely to voice them. This matters because all the evidence suggests that the order in which people speak has a profound effect on the course of a discussion. Earlier comments are more influential, and they tend to provide a framework within which the discussion occurs. As in an information cascade, once that framework is in place, it's difficult for a dissenter to break it down. This wouldn't be a problem if the people who spoke earliest were also more likely to know what they were talking about. But the truth is that, especially when it comes to problems where there is no obvious right answer, there's no guarantee that the most-informed speaker will also be the most influential. On juries, for instance, two-thirds of all foremen—who lead and structure deliberations—are men, and during deliberations men talk far more than women do, even though no one has ever suggested that men as a gender have better insight into questions of guilt and innocence. In groups where the members know each other, status tends to shape speaking patterns, with higher-status people talking more and more often than lower-status people." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Why%20does%20polarization,lower%2Dstatus%20people.)

> "Talkativeness may seem like a curious thing to worry about, but in fact talkativeness has a major impact on the kinds of decisions small groups reach. If you talk a lot in a group, people will tend to think of you as influential almost by default. Talkative people are not necessarily well liked by other members of the group, but they are listened to. And talkativeness feeds on itself. Studies of group dynamics almost always show that the more someone talks, the more he is talked to by others in the group. So people at the center of the group tend to become more important over the course of a discussion. This might be okay if people only spoke when they had expertise in a particular matter. And in many cases, if someone's talking a lot, it's a good sign that they have something valuable to add. But the truth is that there is no clear correlation between talkativeness and expertise." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Talkativeness%20may%20seem,tiveness%20and%20expertise.)

> "Decision markets are well suited to companies because they circumvent the problems that obstruct the flow of information at too many firms: political infighting, sycophancy, and a confusion of status with knowledge. The anonymity of the markets and the fact that they yield a relatively clear solution, while giving individuals an unmistakable incentive to uncover and act on good information, means that their potential value is genuinely hard to overestimate. Major corporate decisions should be informed by decision markets, not made by them. But when the decisions are made, it makes little sense, given everything we know about the virtues of collective decision making and about the importance of diversity, to concentrate power in the hands of one person. In fact, the more important the decision, the more important it is that it not be left in the hands of a single person." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Decision%20markets%20are%20well,of%20a%20single%20person.)
