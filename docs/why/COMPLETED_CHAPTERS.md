> "'Debate-checking' is the logical end of 'fact-checking.' If you are 'proving' one fact/premise/argument at a time, it's essentially cherry-picking. If you are searching for truth, it needs to be conducted in a manner that's maximizing the context of the inquiry space, so relevant arguments, counterarguments, evidence, etc. can be assessed holistically. Once you have done the work of debate mapping, it's very easy to see how one piece of knowledge can completely change the likely veracity and relevance of another piece of knowledge." - [Jamie Joyce](https://twitter.com/JustJamieJoyce/status/1775303902814220342)

People can express their views and also their reasoning/reasons - we might only count votes that have also given a reason and we might even require that people acknowledge that they've seen the reasoning proposed by others and also give those reasons a weight relative to their own reasons

> "It shouldn’t be tech companies per se getting into fact checking. It should be open source technology. Free, universally available code and data for epistemology. Take a piece of text, parse it, extract assertions, compare to explicitly specified knowledge graphs and oracles." - [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1266180931435417600)

> "For those seeking to improve the state of the epistemic commons, and address 21st-century challenges to sensemaking, there is no way forward that does not involve fundamental upgrades to how “facts” are handled in public discourse." - [How to Mislead the Facts - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/how-to-mislead-the-facts/#:~:text=For%20those%20seeking%20to%20improve%20the%20state%20of%20the%20epistemic%20commons%2C%20and%20address%2021st%2Dcentury%20challenges%20to%20sensemaking%2C%20there%20is%20no%20way%20forward%20that%20does%20not%20involve%20fundamental%20upgrades%20to%20how%20%E2%80%9Cfacts%E2%80%9D%20are%20handled%20in%20public%20discourse.)

> "True ignorance is not the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it." - [Karl Popper](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/492103)

> "The war of ideas is a Greek invention. It is one of the most important inventions ever made. Indeed, the possibility of fighting with words and ideas instead of fighting with swords is the very basis of our civilization, and especially of all its legal and parliamentary institutions." - [Karl Popper](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/784074-the-war-of-ideas-is-a-greek-invention-it-is)

> "I never allow myself to hold an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do." - [Charlie Munger](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7447184-i-never-allow-myself-to-hold-an-opinion-on-anything)

> "We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side." - [Charlie Munger](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12934-we-all-are-learning-modifying-or-destroying-ideas-all-the)

> "I believe this topic of Internet disagreement is the single most important problem of humankind. Why? Because exchanging ideas is how we make decisions in society, and how we make decisions drives everything else. If we can do that efficiently, humankind will solve every other problem more efficiently." - [Debate Is Broken. How to Improve It, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/debate-is-broken#:~:text=I%20believe%20this,problem%20more%20efficiently.)

Tomas Pueyo shows how hopelessly broken debate is in his examination of "Will China and the US Go to War?" in an Oxford-style debate in his ["Debate Is Broken. How to Improve It"](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/debate-is-broken) piece.

> "Traditionally, people would say “this is a nuanced debate, full of insightful points”. What I see instead is confusion. It’s hard to remember all the arguments. Which ones matter most to each side. Which ones are most convincing. Where we’re landing with them. Whether any argument failed to get a response from the other side. What were the supporting points for each. Which facts are true. …" - [Debate Is Broken. How to Improve It, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/debate-is-broken#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20people%20would,%E2%80%A6)

> "Imagine a world where every debate was portrayed with a tool that does this, but even better. One where any person could consult the state of any debate and see where things stand. Where they could contribute in the areas they know about. Where they had an incentive to be right. This is a better world. Now expand that from online debates to any decision you might need to make. And imagine you could reuse the pieces of arguments from other people into your own arguments. This is a much better world." - [Debate Is Broken. How to Improve It, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/debate-is-broken#:~:text=imagine%20a%20world,much%20better%20world.)

> "No matter how thin you slice it, there will always be two sides." - [Baruch Spinoza](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/192434-no-matter-how-thin-you-slice-it-there-will-always)

> "Consider four marvels of our age — science, democracy, the justice system and fair markets. In each case the participants (scientists, litigants, politicians and capitalists) are driven by selfish goals. That won't change; not till we redefine human nature. But for years, rules have been fine-tuned in each of these fields of endeavor, to reduce cheating and let quality or truth win much of the time. By harnessing human competitiveness, instead of suppressing it, these "accountability arenas" nourished much of our unprecedented wealth and freedom." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Consider%20four%20marvels,wealth%20and%20freedom.)

> "Today's Internet currently lacks good processes for drawing interest groups — many of them bitterly adversarial — out of those passworded castles to arenas where their champions can have it out, where ideas may be tested and useful notions get absorbed into an amorphous-but-growing general wisdom.
>
> Some claim that such arenas do exist on the Net — in a million chat rooms and Usenet discussion groups — but I find these venues lacking in dozens of ways. Many wonderful and eloquent arguments are raised, only to float away like ghosts, seldom to join any coalescing model. Rabid statements that are decisively refuted simply bounce off the ground, springing back like the undead. Reputations only glancingly correlate with proof or ability. Imagine anything good coming out of science, law, or markets if the old arenas ran that way!" - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=today%27s%20Internet%20currently,ran%20that%20way!)

> "What counts is whether we create conditions that work with our natures — that make cheating futile while encouraging diversity, harnessing the vast human potential to solve problems and discover errors before they explode in our faces. The way to do this will not, and cannot, resemble top-down hierarchies or hoary old ideologies, because no human brain can model or encompass the complexity of our problems, or our true potential to address them." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=What%20counts%20is,to%20address%20them.)

> "**Picture a venue where adversaries can no longer get away with just screaming past each other, but must actively answer each others' accusations, criticisms and complaints.** A place where one group's vision — or model of the world — can be tested, dented, appraised... and possibly improved under the watchful gaze of an interested public. A site where the disprovable can be disproved, the ambiguous can be pinned down a bit more, and good ideas may get deserved attention just a bit sooner." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Picture%20a%20venue,a%20bit%20sooner.)

> "Unfortunately, today's Internet takes us down an old road, toward the quasi-religious fervor of the Nazis' Nuremberg rallies, in 1936, when in-group solidarity was also reinforced by new communication technologies — radio and loudspeakers." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Unfortunately%2C%20today%27s%20Internet%20takes%20us%20down%20an%20old%20road%2C%20toward%20the%20quasi%2Dreligious%20fervor%20of%20the%20Nazis%27%20Nuremberg%20rallies%2C%20in%201936%2C%20when%20in%2Dgroup%20solidarity%20was%20also%20reinforced%20by%20new%20communication%20technologies%20%E2%80%94%20radio%20and%20loudspeakers.)

> "We need some way to thoroughly critique ideas, plans, opinions and policies, letting good ones rise while fallacious ones lose repute. The Internet seems to offer potential for a new style of debate, by establishing disputation arenas for truly extended and meticulous appraisal of a topic, moderated by groups or individuals whose passionate avocation is for neutral intellectual rigor. The more interesting the arguments, the more attention each arena would receive, and the less likely that adversaries could turn down invitations to take part.
>
> How to prevent the artful evasions we see so often in political debates? Superficial and brief, these pointless glamour shows reward charismatic prevarication more than argument, and evidence plays almost no role at all.
>
> One of the internet's great virtues may be its potential for relentlessness. Unlike debates in the real world, there would be no two-hour time limits. Extended online confrontations might last weeks or months, shepherded by proctors whose picky personalities (we all know the type) won't let go of a logical inconsistency on this side of frozen hell. Ideally each side would doggedly pursue its opponents, forcing them to relent and give real answers — while reciprocating the favor.
>
> If people in the world at large were ever to gain confidence in such a system of well-mediated confrontations, the events might acquire the kind of moral force that men used to invest in duels of honor, incurring shame upon those who do not show up or fight by the rules. The most important enforcement tool in any arena will be credibility." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=We%20need%20some,be%20credibility.)

> "Much of the so-called "data" being bandied about on the Net these days is of incredibly poor quality, often lacking provenance or any discussion of error bars, sensitivity, dependency, or semantics. These problems can best be solved the way they are handled in science, by unleashing people with the personalities of bull terriers — critics who could be counted on to slash at every flaw until they are forced to admit (with reluctance) that they can't find any more. Discrepancies might be minimized if arena managers developed standard kits of modeling subroutines, improving them under strict scrutiny, so that both sides in the debate must compare apples to apples... not oranges." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=much%20of%20the%20so,to%20apples...%20not%20oranges.)

> "There would surely be an audience when more passionate participants display vivid graphics and feisty style in the debate arenas of tomorrow. The important point is that this process won't need majority participation to work — just the involvement of nit-pickers from all political persuasions." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=There%20would%20surely%20be%20an%20audience%20when%20more%20passionate%20participants%20display%20vivid%20graphics%20and%20feisty%20style%20in%20the%20debate%20arenas%20of%20tomorrow.%20The%20important%20point%20is%20that%20this%20process%20won%27t%20need%20majority%20participation%20to%20work%20%E2%80%94%20just%20the%20involvement%20of%20nit%2Dpickers%20from%20all%20political%20persuasions.)

> "Move the initial phase of creating policy and legislation onto the Internet by exposing data and policy proposals to scrutiny online, eliminating obvious blunders and attempting to coalesce consensus before legislators even get involved." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Move%20the%20initial%20phase%20of%20creating%20policy%20and%20legislation%20onto%20the%20Internet%20by%20exposing%20data%20and%20policy%20proposals%20to%20scrutiny%20online%2C%20eliminating%20obvious%20blunders%20and%20attempting%20to%20coalesce%20consensus%20before%20legislators%20even%20get%20involved.)

> "Direct challenge. If an Arena achieves any sort of attention or renown, a self-fueling effect may occur. Refusing to accept a challenge may attract opprobrium and contempt. This is not a force to discount. Cowardice and hypocrisy are charges modern politicians cannot leave unchallenged, even when all else survives besmirchment. It is not absurd to consider extending this principle so that challenges tend to have a compulsory aspect, like medieval duels." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Direct%20challenge.%20If,like%20medieval%20duels.)

> "Arenas will grow more attractive if disputants witness actual effects taking place in the outer world of policy and public opinion. Ideally, arenas would serve as testing grounds, to make ideas ready for legislative democracy." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Arenas%20will%20grow%20more%20attractive%20if%20disputants%20witness%20actual%20effects%20taking%20place%20in%20the%20outer%20world%20of%20policy%20and%20public%20opinion.%20Ideally%2C%20arenas%20would%20serve%20as%20testing%20grounds%2C%20to%20make%20ideas%20ready%20for%20legislative%20democracy.)

> "Disputants who agree to send champions would be given two months to prepare their position papers and support materials, according to formats provided by arena organizers — formats designed to discourage polemic, forcing them to parse their position down to discrete logical elements (e.g. underlying assumptions about human nature, about society, about near and long term goals, etc.) A standard questionnaire may provide a start, so both sides will present comparable answers to the same questions and confess their underlying assumptions." - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Disputants%20who%20agree,their%20underlying%20assumptions.)

> "Paraphrasing is hard to do when you've spent years demonizing the opposition, calling them venal or stupid and dismissing their concerns. Success at paraphrasing will be seen as a way of winning credibility. It means "I do understand my opponents... so my disagreement with them is well-informed."" - [Disputation Arenas: Harnessing Conflict and Competitiveness](https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/disputation.html#:~:text=Paraphrasing%20is%20hard%20to%20do%20when%20you%27ve%20spent%20years%20demonizing%20the%20opposition%2C%20calling%20them%20venal%20or%20stupid%20and%20dismissing%20their%20concerns.%20Success%20at%20paraphrasing%20will%20be%20seen%20as%20a%20way%20of%20winning%20credibility.%20It%20means%20%22I%20do%20understand%20my%20opponents...%20so%20my%20disagreement%20with%20them%20is%20well%2Dinformed.%22)

> "It is very obvious that we are not influenced by "facts" but by our interpretation of the facts." - [Alfred Adler](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1124578)


> "A polarization cycle refers to a process in which individuals or groups with conflicting ideologies move progressively further apart in their beliefs and attitudes as a result of interacting. This cycle is self-reinforcing, with each instance of disagreement widening the divide: one party adopts a more extreme stance, then the opposing party responds by also adopting a more extreme stance, until both sides are far outside the rational zone where compromise is possible. Polarization cycles occur in many different contexts, like military conflicts, political discourse, and personal relationships, and they result from miscommunication, emotional reactions, and tribal tendencies." - [Game Theory of Mind: A Psychological Framework for Understanding Human Interaction and Resolving Conflict, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/game-theory-of-mind-a-psychological#:~:text=A%20polarization%20cycle,and%20tribal%20tendencies.)

> "Because societies are complex adaptive systems with dynamics that are analogous to biological organisms, we can think of nations as superorganisms, and under times of uncertainty and existential risk, fear can trigger a Mind 1 response in some or all of the members of a society in unison. This is why you often see waves of nationalist movements during times of war or periods of heavy immigration influx. Fear that one will lose either their life or their way of life causes amygdala hijack, which elicits a worldview-defense response, and this reaction is essentially the source of tribalism.
>
> [Terror management theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_management_theory) provides a framework for understanding why attacks on one’s worldview trigger such strong Mind 1 responses. When the beliefs that shield us from existential terror are questioned or threatened, it's not just an intellectual challenge; it's a profound existential one. This is why discussions about religion or politics can trigger defensive stances that rapidly escalate into polarized debates where emotions run high." - [Game Theory of Mind: A Psychological Framework for Understanding Human Interaction and Resolving Conflict, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/game-theory-of-mind-a-psychological#:~:text=Because%20societies%20are,emotions%20run%20high.)

> "Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, an 18th-century German philosopher, introduced the term **sublation** (or "[Aufhebung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufheben)" in German). In the Hegelian dialectical process, sublation is the synthesis or integration of two opposing views (thesis and antithesis). The term "sublation" conveys a dual meaning: to both negate and preserve. This means that while one concept (the thesis) is seemingly negated by another (the antithesis), elements of both are retained in the resulting synthesis, leading to a new, richer understanding.
>
> The goal of the game we must all play to avoid civilizational collapse is to transform ideological adversaries into collaborators, by achieving a synergistic unity that transcends prior disagreements. This doesn’t mean meeting in the middle or conceding to an idea or belief that is unlikely to be true — it means understanding why that person has that perspective as a result of their worldview, knowledge base, and lived experience. If both parties could get on the same page about the facts of the matter, and have the same knowledge of how reality works, then in theory, they should have interests and goals that are generally aligned." - [Game Theory of Mind: A Psychological Framework for Understanding Human Interaction and Resolving Conflict, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/game-theory-of-mind-a-psychological#:~:text=Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich,are%20generally%20aligned.)

what if we could query what our top 10 heroes think about how to get your life, diet & fitness in order?

what if we could maintain rankings such as "the top 10 or 50 things I think everyone should have read and/or seen" and "what are the top 10 most pressing issues" and have that surfaced objectively - by whoever dares to speak out - we could publicly rank our concerns


What are the top 10 things we should never forget? Or what's attractive in a partner?

there should also be top 50/200/etc. - we should simply rank everything - vote with our actions in a global shared OS of events - events to which others can subscribe to

we can incentivize people to fill out questions to "complete their profile" and nudge them towards answering "top 10 civilizational concerns" - something they might have never even thought about. Some would perhaps look around at what scientists have had to say and boost their answers - hopefully, few would turn to kim kardashian for that sort of question
we could give points for "filling your profile" - values, top 10s, etc.

https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm
https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Tyranny_of_Structurelessness
Excerpts
"Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a 'structureless' group. Any group of people of whatever nature coming together for any length of time, for any purpose, will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. The structure may be flexible, it may vary over time, it may evenly or unevenly distribute tasks, power and resources over the members of the group. But it will be formed regardless of the abilities, personalities and intentions of the people involved. The very fact that we are individuals with different talents, predispositions and backgrounds makes this inevitable. Only if we refused to relate or interact on any basis whatsoever could we approximate 'structurelessness' and that is not the nature of a human group.

...

Principles of Democratic Structuring
- Delegation of specific authority to specific individuals for specific tasks by democratic procedures. Letting people assume jobs or tasks by default only means they are not dependably done. If people are selected to do a task, preferably after expressing an interest or willingness to do it, they have made a commitment which cannot easily be ignored.
-  Requiring all those to whom authority has been delegated to be responsible to all those who selected them. This is how the group has control over people in positions of authority. Individuals may exercise power, but it is the group that has the ultimate say over how the power is exercised.
- Distribution of authority among as many people as is reasonably possible. This prevents monopoly of power and requires those in positions of authority to consult with many others in the process of exercising it. It also gives many people an opportunity to have responsibility for specific tasks and thereby to learn specific skills.
- Rotation of tasks among individuals. Responsibilities which are held too long by one person, formally or informally, come to be seen as that person's 'property' and are not easily relinquished or controlled by the group. Conversely, if tasks are rotated too frequently the individual does not have time to learn her job well and acquire a sense of satisfaction of doing a good job.
- Allocation of tasks along rational criteria. Selecting someone for a position because they are liked by the group, or giving them hard work because they are disliked, serves neither the group nor the person in the long run. Ability, interest and responsibility have got to be the major concerns in such selection. People should be given an opportunity to learn skills they do not have, but this is best done through some sort of 'apprenticeship' programme rather than the 'sink or swim' method. Having a responsibility one can't handle well is demoralising. Conversely, being blackballed from what one can do well does not encourage one to develop one's skills. Women have been punished for being competent throughout most of human history: the movement does not need to repeat this process.
- Diffusion of information to everyone as frequently as possible. Information is power. Access to information enhances one's power. When an informal network spreads new ideas and information among themselves outside the group, they are already engaged in the process of forming an opinion without the group participating. The more one knows abouthow things work, the more politically effective one can be.
- Equal access to resources needed by the group. This is not always perfectly possible, but should be striven for. A member who maintains a monopoly over a needed resource (like a printing press or a darkroom owned by a husband) can unduly influence the use of that resource. Skills and information are also resources. Members' skills and information can be equally available only when members are willing to teach what they know to others.
When these principles are applied, they ensure that whatever structures are developed by different movement groups will be controlled by and be responsible to the group. The group of people in positions of authority will be diffuse, flexible, open and temporary. They will not be in such an easy position to institutionalize their power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group at large. The group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it."

There can be no central organizing structure that is adequate to their construction" - [Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/a-prolegomena-to-any-future-politics-8eac11fd678a#:~:text=our%20future%20institutional%20order%20must%20be%20self%2Dassembling%2C%20self%2Dorganizing%20and%20meta%2Dstable.%20There%20can%20be%20no%20central%20organizing%20structure%20that%20is%20adequate%20to%20their%20construction)

> "Wherever we find orderly, stable systems in Nature, we find that they are hierarchically structured, for the simple reason that without such structuring of complex systems into sub-assemblies, there could be no order and stability-except the order of a dead universe filled with a uniformly distributed gas." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652997-wherever-we-find-orderly-stable-systems-in-nature-we-find)

> "On successively higher levels of the hierarchy we find more complex, flexible and less predictable patterns of activity, while on successively lower levels we find more and more mechanised, stereotyped and predictable patterns. In the language of the physicist, a holon on a higher level of the hierarchy has more degrees of freedom than a holon on a lower level." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9653378-on-successively-higher-levels-of-the-hierarchy-we-find-more)

> "The self-assertive tendency is the dynamic expression of the holon's wholeness, the integrative tendency, the dynamic expression of its partness." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652981-no-man-is-an-island-he-is-a-holon-a-janus-faced#:~:text=the%20self%2Dassertive%20tendency%20is%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20the%20holon%27s%20wholeness%2C%20the%20integrative%20tendency%2C%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20its%20partness.)

> "[Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) provides a governance framework that is decidedly [holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) — roughly, systems within systems. In this way, a holacratic organization approximates a living organism as opposed to a machine to be “designed” or “run.” Practitioners aren’t arranged by managers as cogs within a traditional org chart, but rather define their own functional roles within wider spheres of activity, or “circles.”
>
> Just as cells make up organs within organisms, people have roles within teams within organizations. And though certain cells and roles might hustle themselves into an “executive function,” both the organism’s and the holacratic organization’s brains are self-organizing." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Holacracy%20provides%20a,are%20self%2Dorganizing.)

> "Holacracy makes an organization a complex adaptive system. Unlike command-and-control hierarchies, complex adaptive organizations respond with relative autonomy to stimuli that are, for lack of a better way of putting things, not quite right. Practitioners call these “tensions.” Every part of the organization wants to get things flowing, [following constructal theorist Adrian Bejan](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/the-law-of-flow-is-everywhere. To resolve tensions is to get things flowing — that is, towards realizing the mission. At the risk of oversimplification, let’s break it down:
>
> - Mission. This is why the organization exists and is the end all roles serve. (Because large-scale societies don’t have missions, decentralization is vital.)
>
> - Holacracy Constitution. Sets out the relatively fixed protocols and rules that compose Holacracy’s open-source social operating system.
>
> - Tactical Meetings. A group process for addressing one-off, operational issues in a formalized way, relevant to some functional sphere of activity.
>
> - Governance Meetings. A group process for creating roles, making policies, or assigning ownership of responsibilities.
>
> - Information management. The inputs and output of circle meetings are recorded so anyone can see the rules, roles, and policies at any time." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied)

> "With the holonic structure of circles within circles, we can imagine a greater encompassing supercircle composed of members of lower-order circles. This is an abstract way of describing something similar to a subsidiarity rule, which means decision-making authority should be devolved to the most local feasible level. Holacracy holds the promise of emergent subsidiarity." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=With%20the%20holonic,of%20emergent%20subsidiarity.)

> "Anarchy comes from the greek “an”, meaning without, plus “arkhos”, meaning rulers. Anarchy doesn’t mean without rules, but without rulers. If you have the right rules, the absence of top-down rulers doesn’t remove order — it simply enables order to emerge dynamically from peer-to-peer interactions distributed throughout a system, one tension at a time. So by this definition, you could describe Holacracy as a rule system for humans working together in anarchy — with rules, but without rulers." - [Brian Robertson](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Anarchy%20comes%20from%20the%20greek,with%20rules%2C%20but%20without%20rulers.)

> "Many founders don’t want employees following their orders. They want a team of leaders stepping up and taking a piece of this organization with autonomy and self-direction." - [Brian Robertson](https://www.holacracy.org/#:~:text=Many%20founders%20don%E2%80%99t%20want%20employees%20following%20their%20orders.%20They%20want%20a%20team%20of%20leaders%20stepping%20up%20and%20taking%20a%20piece%20of%20this%20organization%20with%20autonomy%20and%20self%2Ddirection.)

> "A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole. In this way, a holon can be considered a subsystem within a larger hierarchical system. The holon represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes, as well as a way to account for both the self-assertive and the integrative tendencies of organisms." - [Holon, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)#Holarchy:~:text=A%20holon%20is,of%20organisms.)

> "A holarchy is composed of [holons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) or units that are autonomous and self-reliant, but also dependent on the greater whole of which they are part. Thus a holarchy is a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function both as autonomous wholes and as dependent parts." - [Holacracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy#:~:text=a%20holarchy%20is,as%20dependent%20parts.)

> "- Roles instead of job descriptions: The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform. Roles are defined by each circle—or team—via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.
>
> - Circle structure: Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization's mission and strategy.
>
> - Governance process: Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.
>
> - Operational process: Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams according to operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together. There are also key roles to help organise the process and workflow of each circle including Facilitator, Secretary, Lead Link, and Rep Link.
>
> In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.) Holacracy is highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental." - [Holacracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy#:~:text=Roles%20instead%20of,to%20be%20detrimental.)

>
> Created by Intel and popularized by Google, it stands for Objectives and Key Results. It’s a management system where the top leadership of a company decides what it wants to achieve, and split these goals across their team members. They, in turn, break down their goals into smaller goals, and distribute them across their own reports.
>
> This principle of subsidiarity keeps the high-level strategy and direction at the top, but most decisions are made at the bottom by the people. It’s as if the leadership designed the mechanism, the substrate, and everybody else filled in the specifics." - [The Democracy of the Future, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/future-of-democracy-decentralized#:~:text=Management%20by%20results%20is,filled%20in%20the%20specifics.)

> "Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up—from the pieces to the whole, from cell to organ to organism, from individual to team, from actual production to management of production. Early farmers decided to come together and form cities for self-protection and for making trade more efficient. Life started with single-cell bacteria, not with elephants. The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating subsystems do their jobs better. This is something, unfortunately, that both the higher and the lower levels of a greatly articulated hierarchy easily can forget. Therefore, many systems are not meeting our goals because of malfunctioning hierarchies." - [Thinking in Systems 2008, by Donella Meadows](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/fragments-vertebrate-technology#:~:text=Hierarchies%20evolve%20from,of%20malfunctioning%20hierarchies)

The promise of our continued interaction keeps us in line. Successful cooperation, Axelrod argued, required that people start off by being nice—that is, by being willing to cooperate—but that they had to be willing to punish noncooperative behavior as soon as it appeared. The best approach was to be "nice, forgiving, and retaliatory."" - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20cooperation,nice%2C%20forgiving%2C%20and%20retaliatory.%22)

> "Fehr and Gächter tweaked the public-goods game to demonstrate: this time, at the end of every round, they revealed what each person had or had not contributed to the public pot, which made the free riders visible to everyone else. Then they offered people the opportunity to punish the free riders. For the price of a third of a token, you could take one token away from the free rider. Two things happened as a result. First, people spent money to punish the evildoers—even though, again, it was economically irrational for them to do so. Second, the free riders shaped up and started contributing their fair share. in fact, even during the last rounds of these games, when there was no reason to keep contributing (since no punishment could be inflicted), people continued to chip in." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://wisdomofcrowds.blogspot.com/2011/01/chapter-six-part-vii.html#:~:text=Fehr%20and%20G%C3%A4chter%20tweaked,continued%20to%20chip%20in.)

> "The coin of the realm, for most scientists, is not cash but rather recognition. Even so, scientists are undoubtedly as self-seeking and as self-interested as the rest of us. The genius of the way science is organized, though, makes their self-interested behavior redound to the benefits of all of us. In the process of winning notoriety for themselves, they make the group – that is, the scientific community and then, indirectly, the rest of us – smarter." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2009/07/book-review-wisdom-of-crowds-by-james.html#:~:text=The%20coin%20of,of%20us%20%E2%80%93%20smarter.)

> "Pursuing their own self-interest is more complicated for scientists than it might sound. While scientists are fundamentally competing for recognition and attention, that recognition and attention can only be afforded them by the very people they're competing against. So science presents us with the curious paradox of an enterprise that is simultaneously intensely competitive and intensely cooperative. The quest for recognition ensures a steady infusion of diverse thought, since no one becomes famous for restating what's already known. (This makes it less important that scientists tend to be interested in what other scientists are interested in, since the quest for originality forces researchers to think past convention.) And the competition also works to provide an inherent check on flawed ideas, since, as the philosopher David Hull has argued, showing the flaws in other people's work is one way to make a name for yourself. But all that competition depends on a given level of cooperation, because it's the rare scientist who can flourish in isolation from the work of his peers. What allows this strange blend of collaboration and competition to flourish is the scientific ethos that demands open access to information. This ethos dates back to the origins of the scientific revolution in the seventeenth century. In 1665, the Royal Society— one of the first institutions, and certainly the most important, formed to foster the growth of scientific knowledge—published the first issue of its Philosophical Transactions. It was a seminal moment in the history of science, because of the journal's fierce commitment to the idea that all new discoveries should be disseminated as widely and freely as possible. Henry Oldenburg, the first secretary of the Royal Society and the editor of the Transactions, pioneered the idea that secrecy was inimical to scientific progress, and convinced scientists that they should give up their sole ownership of their ideas in exchange for the recognition they would receive as the creator or discoverer of those ideas. What Oldenburg grasped was the peculiar character of knowledge, which does not, unlike other commodities, get used up as it is consumed and which can be therefore spread widely without losing its value. If anything, in fact, the more a piece of knowledge becomes available, the more valuable it potentially becomes, because of the wider array of possible uses for it. As a result, the historian Joel Mokyr writes, the scientific revolution became the period "in which 'open science' emerged, when knowledge about the natural world became increasingly nonproprietary and scientific advances and discoveries were freely shared with the public at large. Thus scientific knowledge became a public good, communicated freely rather than confined to a secretive exclusive few as had been the custom in medieval Europe." This tradition of open publication and communication of insights was, of course, central to the success of Western science. It's open science that made the self-interested behavior of scientists collectively beneficial. Scientists were willing to publish their insights because that was the route to public recognition and influence. If one wanted to think about this process in market terms—as some have tried to do—you could say that scientists were paid by other people's attention. As the sociologist of science Robert K. Merton famously put it, "In science, one's private property is established by giving its substance away." The challenge the scientific community faces today is whether the success of Western science can survive the growing commercialization of scientific endeavors. Science and commerce have, of course, been intertwined for centuries. But as an increasing share of scientific research and development is funded by corporations, which see themselves as having an economic interest in protecting information rather than in disseminating it widely, the nature of scientific exchange may change. The sociologist Warren Hagstrom talked about science as a "gift economy" rather than an exchange economy. And the idea of science as made up of "invisible colleges" of researchers bound by their common interest in expanding knowledge, if perhaps naive, still has a powerful hold not just on laypeople but on scientists themselves. Corporations, on the other hand, are generally not gift givers nor do they thrive on collegiality. The fact that public funding is still instrumental to science, and particularly to basic research, insulates scientists to some extent from commercial pressures. And although the patent system limits what others can do with a given invention, it also—by requiring the inventor to publish the details of his invention in order to get a patent—plays a role in continuing to fuel the free flow of information. But the conflict between science and business is not imaginary. The spectacle of companies funding studies and then demanding that they be suppressed when the results do not come back to their satisfaction is not something that would have pleased Henry Oldenburg. TALKING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC ENDEAVOR in terms of the quest for recognition may make it sound as if scientists were simply fame hounds (which, of course, some of them are). But recognition is not, at least in theory, about celebrity or fashion. Recognition is instead the proper reward for genuinely new and interesting discoveries. Scientists want to be recognized because it's nice to be recognized. But they also want to be recognized because recognition is what allows new ideas to be incorporated into the general body of scientific knowledge. What's intriguing about science from the perspective of collective problem solving is that it is the community as a whole that bestows the recognition, which is to say that it's the community as a whole that decides whether or not a scientific hypothesis is true and whether it's original. This doesn't mean that scientific truth is in the eye of the beholder. The coronavirus caused SARS before the WHO announced that the coronavirus caused SARS. But in scientific terms, the coronavirus only became the cause of SARS once other scientists had scrutinized the work of the labs and accepted it as proving what they said it proved." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Pursuing%20their%20own,said%20it%20proved.)

> "UNFORTUNATELY, THERE is SOMETHING of a flaw in this idealized picture of the way the scientific community discovers truth. And the flaw is that most scientific work never gets noticed. Study after study has shown that most scientific papers are read by almost no one, while a small number of papers are read by many people. Famous scientists find their work cited vastly more often than scientists who are less well known." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=UNFORTUNATELY%2C%20THERE%20is,less%20well%20known.)

> "Why does polarization occur? One reason is because of people's reliance on "social comparison." This means more than that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else (which, of course, they are). It means that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else with an eye toward maintaining their relative position within the group. In other words, if you start out in the middle of the group and you believe the group has moved, as it were, to the right, you're inclined to shift your position to the right as well, so that relative to everyone else you're standing still. Of course, by moving to the right you're moving the group to the right, making social comparison something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. What's assumed to be real eventually becomes real. It's important to see, though, that polarization isn't just the result of people trying to stay in tune with the group. It also results, strangely, from people doing their best to figure out what the right answer is. As we saw in our discussion of social proof—remember the passersby who ended up staring into an empty sky—people who are uncertain about what they believe will look to other members of the group for help. That's the point of deliberating, after all. But if a majority of the group already supports one position, then most of the arguments that will be made will be in support of that position. So the uncertain people are likely to be swayed in that direction, in part simply because that's more of what they'll hear. Similarly, people who have more extreme positions are more likely to have strong, coherent arguments in favor of their positions and are also more likely to voice them. This matters because all the evidence suggests that the order in which people speak has a profound effect on the course of a discussion. Earlier comments are more influential, and they tend to provide a framework within which the discussion occurs. As in an information cascade, once that framework is in place, it's difficult for a dissenter to break it down. This wouldn't be a problem if the people who spoke earliest were also more likely to know what they were talking about. But the truth is that, especially when it comes to problems where there is no obvious right answer, there's no guarantee that the most-informed speaker will also be the most influential. On juries, for instance, two-thirds of all foremen—who lead and structure deliberations—are men, and during deliberations men talk far more than women do, even though no one has ever suggested that men as a gender have better insight into questions of guilt and innocence. In groups where the members know each other, status tends to shape speaking patterns, with higher-status people talking more and more often than lower-status people." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Why%20does%20polarization,lower%2Dstatus%20people.)

> "Talkativeness may seem like a curious thing to worry about, but in fact talkativeness has a major impact on the kinds of decisions small groups reach. If you talk a lot in a group, people will tend to think of you as influential almost by default. Talkative people are not necessarily well liked by other members of the group, but they are listened to. And talkativeness feeds on itself. Studies of group dynamics almost always show that the more someone talks, the more he is talked to by others in the group. So people at the center of the group tend to become more important over the course of a discussion. This might be okay if people only spoke when they had expertise in a particular matter. And in many cases, if someone's talking a lot, it's a good sign that they have something valuable to add. But the truth is that there is no clear correlation between talkativeness and expertise." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Talkativeness%20may%20seem,tiveness%20and%20expertise.)

> "Decision markets are well suited to companies because they circumvent the problems that obstruct the flow of information at too many firms: political infighting, sycophancy, and a confusion of status with knowledge. The anonymity of the markets and the fact that they yield a relatively clear solution, while giving individuals an unmistakable incentive to uncover and act on good information, means that their potential value is genuinely hard to overestimate. Major corporate decisions should be informed by decision markets, not made by them. But when the decisions are made, it makes little sense, given everything we know about the virtues of collective decision making and about the importance of diversity, to concentrate power in the hands of one person. In fact, the more important the decision, the more important it is that it not be left in the hands of a single person." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Decision%20markets%20are%20well,of%20a%20single%20person.)

What if people were willing to pay for better UIs to participate in the global brain and get ahead just like they pay for video games? What if we removed all unnecessary barriers to entry to helping humanity?

> "Nearly 70% of Americans play on some sort of device. People between the ages of 15–20 collectively spent over eight billion hours playing Fortnite in 2018. While that number is nearly double the roughly 4.2 billion man-hours spent on the Apollo mission, it’s trivial compared to the total time humanity has spent playing video games in general.
>
> That’s a lot of human potential, being spent on something of questionable value. The traditional justification for seemingly harmful or non-productive behaviors is that people have an individual right to freely choose how to spend their time. But the decisions involved in gaming are often far from rational or even individual. Many video games increasingly take advantage of instinctual psychological drives, routing around higher reflection to create addicting escape experiences for people who find real life increasingly frustrating and unrewarding.
>
> The international video game industry is a compelling profit engine—it generated $135 billion in revenue in 2018. U.S. gamers spent $36 billion on content, which includes the games themselves and in-game purchases. It’s a behemoth industry, and is growing steadily at a rate of roughly $10 billion per year. The incentive for psychological optimization of games by developers and companies is obvious solely from the numbers. That incentive has existed since the early ’70s when the commercialization of games first began." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=Nearly%2070%25%20of,games%20first%20began.)

> "As the industry iterated on the successes of the ’70s, developers started to notice specific psychological effects that drove popularity in their games, and they began to intentionally embed those effects to drive demand. One of the most important concepts in the industry to emerge during this time was the [compulsion loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsion_loop). In a very general sense, loops are sequences of actions that organisms will reliably repeat to gain rewards. Obvious examples from the animal kingdom are things like having sex and consuming food, but in the gaming domain, loops are sequences of actions within games that players will reliably repeat to get a rewarding experience—the rush when Candy Crush colors connect and pop in a dazzling animation, or when the “Head Shot: +150” badge flashes across the screen after a Call of Duty player manages to excavate the brain of another. Loops are fundamental to understanding how game designers and developers harness the psychological tendencies of the players." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=As%20the%20industry,of%20the%20players.)

> "Game developers aren’t necessarily malicious or even conscious in using techniques to make their games more psychologically compelling. The practice has evolved over the course of the industry’s maturation to become more of an inherent feature of video games than an intentional one. Firms now struggle to make money unless they use state-of-the-art psychological techniques in their games, and it’s hard to even imagine what it would mean for a video game to be fun if it didn’t involve some loop of challenge and reward. There’s a reason the brain is attracted to such activities: in reality, loops of skill-improvement, challenge, and reward are the substance of a successful life.
>
> In a way, what video games do is provide an alternate, simulated environment that is more psychologically palatable and seemingly rewarding—where success is less demanding than real life. A few game developers strive to limit addictive mechanics and give their games artistic or intellectual content, but most don’t.
>
> For someone whose real life isn’t otherwise engaging them with a stream of surmountable challenges, skill growth, and rewarding victories, it’s easy to understand the draw of escape into virtual worlds that do. For some young men, video games have even displaced having a job. It’s not terribly surprising that this has happened just as a stagnant economy and extreme competition has put respected, decent-paying jobs, and participation in rewarding social fabric, increasingly out of reach. If the challenge of real social participation becomes increasingly inaccessible, some proportion will decide not to bother at all." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=Game%20developers%20aren%E2%80%99t,bother%20at%20all.)

> "Human-vs.-human competition introduces a high-stakes arena that would’ve been unimaginable to the early game developers of the ’70s. Competing against other humans is psychologically intense and rewarding. It isn’t just a solitary activity, but a social one. When you beat another person in a game, it subconsciously becomes a story about your relative social status. If you win, you’re better than they are. If you lose, you need to try harder to keep up, or lose respect." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=Human%2Dvs.%2Dhuman%20competition%20introduces,keep%20up%2C%20or%20lose%20respect.)

> "Another effect of imbuing games with human-vs.-human competition is the emergence of a positive feedback system that incentivizes players to dedicate more and more hours to honing their skills. For any given competitive game, there is a range of natural talent. Natural talent, though, only accounts for so much of any given player’s success in the competitive arena—a far better predictor is aggregate time spent playing. Many games employ a numerical Match Making Ranking (MMR) system to measure the skill of players relative to their peers, which makes it easy to test for a potential correlation between skill and time spent playing." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=Another%20effect%20of%20imbuing,and%20time%20spent%20playing.)

> "By providing a hierarchical structure that players can use to compete with one another and ascend on their way to obtaining the glory and riches given to the pros, developers can increase the amount of time and money that players spend in-game. Motives to reinforce competitive behavior have led to unprecedentedly large tournament prize pools, such as Epic’s Fortnite World Cup at a total of $30 million—more than Wimbledon’s prize pool in 2015." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=By%20providing%20a,pool%20in%202015.)

> "They waste years of their lives that they later realize they should have spent studying, planning, and self-improving. They neglect their health and social lives.
>
> These are still relatively speculative problems for most people, but as video games are only slated to become even more compelling, and perhaps as real social life becomes ever less compelling, these trends will continue.
>
> The long-term influence of addictive, competitive loops, and escape from social reality, on the developing brains, skills, and social development of children, especially on a mass scale, remains to be seen. Gamers under the age of 18 constitute 21% of the market, and gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 make up 40% of the market. The majority of players have either grown up in the video game era of the last couple of decades, or are in the process of doing so.
>
> Little is known about the human brain and how the formation of habits and neural pathways in adolescence can affect long-term social behavior in community participation, family formation, and work life. But among a group of roughly six hundred 8th and 9th graders in Minnesota, those who were classified as addicted to video games self-reported participating in more physical fights, starting more arguments with friends and teachers, and receiving lower grades than their non-addicted peers. It could be that video games are causing psychological problems, or it could be that kids who have more social problems find the addictive escape of video games more compelling. Either way, it indicates a relationship between video game addiction and social pathology. This study was done back in the early 2000s, meaning these children now find themselves in that 18–35 age bracket.
>
> Video games, digital media, and surrounding culture don’t just affect people as individuals, they affect what kind of culture we have. It’s common for technically or artistically oriented young people to say they want to make video games as a career. Roughly three times more American kids want to be vloggers and YouTubers than astronauts. The same survey showed that 56% of kids in China want to grow up to be astronauts, compared to 18% who are captivated by vlogging. How kids spend their time, and therefore what they idealize, isn’t just a matter of individual preferences and harms, but a matter of collective strength and ambitions. America’s collective future perhaps starts to look a bit darker. The 21st century might see significant geopolitical reshuffling influenced in part by these cultural dynamics.
>
> The social reorientation towards video game culture makes it even harder to participate in non-virtual social life for many people, exacerbating the low quality of social life that drives much of the demand for video games in the first place. Why go out when everyone else is at home playing video games or watching Netflix?
>
> This general problem isn’t unique to video games. Activities like traditional sports, alcohol-oriented bar and club culture, gambling, sexual subcultures, and other forms of entertainment have existed in all civilizations. They at times get out of control to antisocial levels. But mostly they are kept well-regulated by social norms and laws that limit their downsides and cultivate their upsides, and by competition from more productive activities. This process can be thought of as a sort of “domestication” on the activities in question. Athletic sports and alcohol are mostly domesticated. Video games, being new, are still a wild west of exploration and exploitation.
>
> The paternalist stance is often advanced in cases like this where market forces, perhaps unstoppable by anyone except the state, are innovating in a socially harmful direction. The gaming industry is now largely characterized by its use of a form of addiction to drive profits, and there is a strong precedent of preventative measures being instituted for addictive or socially harmful products." - [Virtual Addiction Is Not an Individual Problem, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/12/virtual-addiction-is-not-an-individual-problem/#:~:text=They%20waste%20years,socially%20harmful%20products.)

> "Many video games exploit irrationality, and lack a more holistic social valuation story. At best, playing video games together promotes some healthy social fabric. Alternately, video games may have social value as a form of real artistic expression. But even these points of value are only a small part of the overall social impact story. Time and human capital spent on video games isn’t really getting us much, socially or individually, in return.
>
> The domestication pressure on entertainment norms towards benign productive functionality usually comes from the community and the state. Someone has to think about the big picture, and have the power and incentives to act on that thinking to change how entertaining activities like video games actually work. Individual gamers and developers outside of leadership positions in society just don’t have the power or incentive scope to address these collective questions.
>
> The problem of managing compelling digital media, keeping people from retreating from society, is closely related to the dynamics described by Seth Largo’s [recent article on integration](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/08/29/from-zacatecas-to-mission-control/), and Wolf Tivy’s [piece on radicalization](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/09/05/my-time-on-a-terror-trial-jury/): in the absence of strong leadership from the main trunk of society, creating positive and productive social roles for people, those people find other things to do and believe in. Some stay provincial in their native subculture, some become radicalized, and some fall into self-destructive escapism and addiction to video games or television.
>
> The main problem might not be with video games at all, but with the weakness of the main social fabric, and lack of opportunities for more purposeful and fulfilling behavior. Obsessive gaming is a cope—an elegant cope that allows players to push further into the back of their minds the fear and reality of years slipping away. It’s elegant because it’s compelling, more socially acceptable than hard drugs, and because there’s still some social fabric. Normal society is failing to provide compelling alternative opportunities to the psychological loops and constructed escape experiences of video games.
>
> The fast pace of development of ever more compelling digital media like video games requires a corresponding acceleration of the ability of society to domesticate these behaviors into their most benign and socially helpful variants. That is, like many other problems, the problem of domesticating video games is partially a problem of state and community capacity—the same state capacity that would be needed to fill the holes in the social fabric that drive so much demand for addicting video games in the first place.
>
> Missouri Senator Josh Hawley’s recent bill to ban loot boxes and certain payment incentives in video games is perhaps an early signal of this kind of state-driven domestication action—though one which also shows how difficult it can be to regulate such hyper-specific practices, and inadequate on its own to tackle the problems with the dynamic profit-driven ecosystem of video game development. But American society is at a historical low point of state capacity and strength of social fabric, so our governing institutions may not recognize the problem and get a jump on it, or have the capacity to intervene successfully.
