> "The future is religious, no one can stop that anymore. The question remaining is what that religiosity will be turned toward." - [Jonathan Pageau](https://twitter.com/PageauJonathan/status/1727488161926754625)


> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

> "A society whose members are united by the fact that they think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1204111)

> "Society is not a mere sum of individuals. Rather, the system formed by their association represents a specific reality which has its own characteristics... The group thinks, feels, and acts quite differently from the way in which its members would were they isolated. If, then, we begin with the individual, we shall be able to understand nothing of what takes place in the group." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/541413)

> "Man is only a moral being because he lives in society, since morality consists in solidarity with the group, and varies according to that solidarity.

OMEGA POINT STUFF BY BOBBY AZARIAN GOES HERE

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

God is the search engine of meaning in life

The god of the 21st century is the most just of all

God is the planetary nervous system of humanity

(Sovereign) identity is the key to god

God is the fairness protocol

God is the purest form of cooperation - the most efficient one - achievable only with maximal alignment which requires trust through  transparency and reputation.

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

God is leaving the world better after yourself

We need something that would sell itself

God is a story and we can choose him

God is an attractor - an aspiration. God is always further - there’s always more to improve. God delivers protopia - by terhering our values as the source of everything for meaning

God is the answer to meaning - god is what we create. God is what we contribute to - that’s god. The evolution of culture - the human spirit

So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

^^ Not sure about this...

> "We can plunder all the religious and philosophical history and check out what were the ideas that really survived what were ideas that were timeless and that turns out to be the ideas that concerned humans and what were the ideas that were time specific oh they turned out to be the the concern technology that concerned equality is like learning and reading and speaking and writing or whatever we humans do or artistic expression okay that's what changes over time now if we know that if you see that pattern we can then construct a value system that works for us today and because it concerns a new paradigm as nietzsche would say and we have a freedom then to be creative about this we call that process paradigmatics so what we're creating today is a system of values that work for us and that development is with metamodernism for example today's interest it is interested in what kind of values do we co-create here so we get the really creative discussion and conversation but also that the little genius among us that need their own space to work in the little monasteries to construct whatever they can construct can also do that and so we can also embrace that engineers and traders are creating enormous value and they need our support they might even need some kind of religious direction." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=4657)

> "Noocracy ( where nous means 'wise' and kratos means 'rule' therefore 'rule of the wise' ) is a form of government where decision making is done by wise people. The idea is proposed by various philosophers such as [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha), [al-Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi) and [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius)." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Noocracy%20(/,and%20Confucius.)

> "The irrationality of voters inherent in democracies can be explained by two major behavioral and cognitive patterns. Firstly, most of the voters think that the marginal contribution of their vote will not make a difference on election outcomes; therefore, they do not find it useful to inform themselves on political matters. In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways. This psychological phenomenon causes voters to strongly identify themselves with a certain political group, specifically find evidence to support arguments aligning with their preferred ideological inclinations, and eventually vote with a high level of bias." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=The%20irrationality%20of,level%20of%20bias.)

> "Supporters of noocracy see a greater danger in the fact that politicians will actually prefer to implement the policy decisions of citizens to win elections and stabilize their power, without paying particular attention to the content and further outcomes of these policies. In democracies, the problem is that voters are prone to make bad policy decisions and therefore that politicians are incentivized to implement these policies due to personal benefits." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=supporters%20of%20noocracy,to%20personal%20benefits.)

> "Christiano proposes a ruling system based on division of political labor, in which citizens set the agenda for political discussions and determine the aims of the society, whereas legislators are in charge of deciding on the means to achieve these aims. For noocrats, transferring the decision-making mechanism to a body of specifically trained, specialized and experienced body is expected to result in superior and more efficient policy outcomes." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Christiano%20proposes%20a,efficient%20policy%20outcomes.)

> "Singapore has a political system that favors meritocracy; the path to government in Singapore is structured in such a way that only those with above-average skills are identified with strict university-entrance exams, recruiting processes, etc., and then rigorously trained to be able to devise best the solutions that benefit the entire society. In the words of the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth. This system primarily works due to citizens’ belief that political leaders tend to have a better understanding of country's long-term plans than themselves; therefore, as they see positive policy outcomes, they tend to go along with the system, rather than complain about the meritocratic dimensions." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Singapore%20has%20a,the%20meritocratic%20dimensions.)

One big problem with meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy is that we've been unable to compute the reputation objectively for accountability. They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability. Proxies such as accreditation have proven bad.
Another criticism is one of lack of diversity and the superior results of the wisdom of crowds. But we can design a meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy however we like in order to maximize the collective intelligence of as many people as possible - it doesn't have to be a small clique of people that make all the contributions.
Also we can separate decision making from values & overall direction & goals so that we all get an equal vote for the values & direction.

> "A meritocracy (in theory) is where we judge people on the basis of their individual abilities rather than their position in the social hierarchy or their family connections. For most of human history, we have not lived in anything resembling a meritocracy. Until recently, the most important institution in society was the family. You inherited your position and defined your identity as a member of a family. As a result, society was much more static than it is now. Social mobility was low, and all that mattered was who you knew. You didn’t get jobs on merit –  they were regarded as things that people owned and could pass down to their children. What meritocracy did was create a new kind of aristocracy. The only alternative to the aristocracy of land and inheritance was to replace it with an aristocracy of virtue and talent." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=A%20meritocracy%20(in,virtue%20and%20talent.)

Which leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the "best" & who "earns" it. In one sense it’s a fair process in that, in a successful meritocracy, whoever’s the best, should get it. But in another sense it’s unfair in that people didn’t get the same chance. Because of biological or cultural factors, or just sheer luck, not everyone had the same starting line. And this is the fatal flaw of the term meritocracy — it is about who wins the race but, in its quest to be fair, implies there’s an equal starting line." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=it%20was%20always,equal%20starting%20line.)

> "And if we don’t literally mean *equality* of opportunity, let’s just say “sufficient opportunity for all”, meaning we focus on constantly expanding absolute opportunity, without focusing on relative opportunity. Indeed, we should focus on expanding opportunity for all, we should focus on equal treatment under the law for all." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=And%20if%20we,law%20for%20all)

> "Everything you love is a result of inequality. When you seek a mate, do you want someone who is exactly average, just like everyone else, or do you want someone who is special? When you have kids, do you want them to have the same life outcomes as every other kid in the world, or do you want them to do better than that? When you have a job, do you aspire to turn in absolutely average performance, to be careful not to ever exceed the performance of your peers? Or do you aspire to do the best you can, even if that means you do better than your peers? Is it moral to want the best surgeon, the best teachers, or the best spouse to raise a family with?" - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Everything%20you%20love,a%20family%20with%3F)

> "Belief in an aristocracy of talent is self-fulfilling. If people believe the best people can rise up, and that effort impacts outcomes, they’ll work for it. Which is why threading this needle matters: The best people should be in charge, via a transparent process where anyone can prove they’re the best, but also accepting that people had different opportunities to begin with. In other words, we’re all running the same race, but at different starting lines. And that’s OK. Let’s try to move up everyone’s starting lines, without trying to hold anyone back, and more importantly, let’s try to maximize how far everyone can go." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Belief%20in%20an,everyone%20can%20go.)

> "The quality of a meritocracy is a product of (1) the team of people and (2) the way those people interact with each other. A meritocracy (and the business itself) is ultimately judged by its (3) outcomes (i.e., performance relative to goals). We spend time defining and measuring the effectiveness of our team and our interactions because we believe that they drive the outcomes on which the company depends directly and that they also drive our outcomes over the longer-term." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20quality%20of,the%20longer%2Dterm)

> "We are aiming for interactions that get the best out of individuals and the team, with truth and a deep desire to excel at their core. We think great leadership in this context is lots of “people in the arena”, meaning people who will relentlessly pursue truth wherever it takes them and who are totally unwilling to be on the sidelines. This means they are: (1) speaking up and exposing their honest thoughts and willing to be wrong, (2) unafraid to be transparent about their stumbles, imperfections, and decision-making and, (3) seeking to find the best ideas and get the most out of others through deliberate inclusion." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=We%20are%20aiming,through%20deliberate%20inclusion.)

> "The more unsure you are and the more assumptions you’re making, the more important it is to engage with curiosity rather than starting with assertions or certainty. In a meritocracy, greatness isn’t being the best debater, winning the most arguments, or personally having the right answer most often. It’s being honest about what you truly think while engaging with deep humility and the intent to learn, and in doing so increasing the probability of the team succeeding. Every member of the community has a responsibility to be honest and direct, and we expect a constant flow of feedback in all directions. It is most critical that feedback flow from those with less power to those with more, not because those with less power should bear the greatest burden, but because there are relatively more challenges to feedback moving in that direction — everything from power dynamics to frequency of interaction. In line with that everyone, but most especially leaders, has a responsibility not just to solicit honesty from others, but to assess whether that’s actually happening across all levels and if not, to diagnose why." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20more%20unsure,to%20diagnose%20why.)

> "Transparency includes everything from exposing the logic of decisions, to putting light on mistakes, to giving feedback publicly, and more. By and large, you should start from the place that more light is better." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=Transparency%20includes%20everything%20from%20exposing%20the%20logic%20of%20decisions%2C%20to%20putting%20light%20on%20mistakes%2C%20to%20giving%20feedback%20publicly%2C%20and%20more.%20By%20and%20large%2C%20you%20should%20start%20from%20the%20place%20that%20more%20light%20is%20better)

> "Focusing on outcomes increases the probability of a good design because it forces you to evaluate whether the team and interactions are sufficient to achieve what you want. It also creates more entrepreneurialism, innovation, and pushes people out on the risk curve as incentives align and teams come together and interact around a shared destination and value creation." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20outcomes,and%20value%20creation.)

Jim Rutt Show EP #32: Jason Brennan on Irrational Democracy & Academia
epistocracy !!!
Problems with democracy and voters:
- people disinterested in politics - not voting at all
- very low understanding of what is going on
- systematic misinformation - not just ignorance - ppl get the facts wrong
- different responses to political questions even after just 1 week without anything having changed - random answers
- partisanship, tribalism & confirmation (& disconfirmation) bias
- ignorance, apathy, irrationality
- no skin in the game
- position bias (pick the first thing, pay less attention to anything other than the 1st page, etc.)
- likeability - superficial features of candidates
- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

> "We have to ask ourselves what we think government is actually for. Some people think it has the value a painting has, which is to say that it’s symbolic. In that view, you might think, “We should have democracy because it’s a way of civilizing and expressing the idea that all of us have equal value.”
>
> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people. So if you think government is for that purpose, and I do, then you have to wonder if we should pick the form of government that best delivers the goods, whatever that might be." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20to,that%20might%20be.)

> "There was a time in British history ([from around 1600 until 1950](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-history-of-university-representation/)) where people who had college degrees would get an extra vote, but this was a stupid idea. It pains me to say this as an educator, but it turns out that university education has very little impact on how much people know. In general, college-educated people know more than non-college-educated people, but it’s not the college that’s making the difference." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=There%20was%20a,making%20the%20difference.)

> "Every kind of political system is abused, and we should guard against that. Here’s what I propose we do: Everyone can vote, even children. No one gets excluded. But when you vote, you do three things.
>
> First, you tell us what you want. You cast your vote for a politician, or for a party, or you take a position on a referendum, whatever it might be. Second, you tell us who you are. We get your demographic information, which is anonymously coded, because that stuff affects how you vote and what you support.And the third thing you do is take a quiz of very basic political knowledge. When we have those three bits of information, we can then statistically estimate what the public would have wanted if it was fully informed.
>
> Under this system, it’s not really the case that you have more power than I do. We can’t really point to any individual and say you were excluded, or your vote counted for more. The idea is to gauge what the public would actually want if it had all the information it needed." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=Every%20kind%20of,information%20it%20needed.)

> "Here’s my paradoxical-sounding idea: Let democracy decide what goes on the test." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=here%E2%80%99s%20my%20paradoxical%2Dsounding%20idea%3A%20Let%20democracy%20decide%20what%20goes%20on%20the%20test.)

> "If you survey people and ask them what it takes to be an informed voter, they say the same kinds of things I would say, but you quickly find out that many of them don’t know the answers... Voters know in the abstract what they ought to know; they just don’t actually know the things they think they should." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=If%20you%20survey,think%20they%20should.)

> "We have the right to choose our partner, to choose our religion, to choose what we’re going to eat, where we live, what job we’ll do, etc. While some of these things do impose costs on others, they’re primarily about carving out a sphere of autonomy for the individual, and about preventing other people from having control over you.
>
> A right to participate in politics seems fundamentally different because it involves imposing your will upon other people. So I’m not sure that any of us should have that kind of right, at least not without any responsibilities." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20the,without%20any%20responsibilities.)

> "This is a weird metaphor, but imagine I couldn’t move my arms because they were tied. But then you were to give me coffee whenever I wanted it. That’s kind of what’s going on in a democracy: I’m still getting the coffee, and that’s awesome, but I’m not actually responsible for the coffee getting into my mouth — you’re the one that’s doing it. No matter how you look at it, it’s really the group that has the power, not the individual, even if we’re in the group that has the power." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=This%20is%20a,has%20the%20power.)

> "My worry is that people too often vote for basically arbitrary or historical reasons that have little to do with interests or ideologies. Certain identity groups get attached to certain parties and that’s just the way it is." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=My%20worry%20is%20that%20people%20too%20often%20vote%20for%20basically%20arbitrary%20or%20historical%20reasons%20that%20have%20little%20to%20do%20with%20interests%20or%20ideologies.%20Certain%20identity%20groups%20get%20attached%20to%20certain%20parties%20and%20that%E2%80%99s%20just%20the%20way%20it%20is.)

> "I like to say I’m a fan of democracy, and I’m also a fan of Iron Maiden, but I think Iron Maiden has quite a few albums that are terrible — and I think democracy is kind of like this. It’s great, it’s the best system we have so far, but we shouldn’t accept that it can’t be improved.
>
> We might recognize that it’s better than anything else we’ve tried, and yet we can also see that there are all these persistent pathologies that exist, and so we should be asking, “How can we fix them?” We should be constantly experimenting and discovering what works and what doesn’t." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=I%20like%20to,and%20what%20doesn%E2%80%99t.)

> "Roughly a third of American voters think that the Marxist slogan “From each according to his ability to each according to his need” appears in the Constitution. About as many are incapable of naming even one of the three branches of the United States government. Fewer than a quarter know who their senators are, and only half are aware that their state has two of them. Democracy is other people, and the ignorance of the many has long galled the few." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=that%20the%20Marxist,galled%20the%20few)

> "If I do not vote, your vote counts more." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=If%20I%20do%20not%20vote%2C%20your%20vote%20counts%20more)

> "Political scientists have long hoped to find an “invisible hand” in politics comparable to the one that Adam Smith described in economics. Voter ignorance wouldn’t matter much if a democracy were able to weave individual votes into collective political wisdom, the way a market weaves the self-interested buy-and-sell decisions of individual actors into a prudent collective allocation of resources. But, as Brennan reports, the mathematical models that have been proposed work only if voter ignorance has no shape of its own—if, for example, voters err on the side of liberalism as often as they err on the side of conservatism, leaving decisions in the hands of a politically knowledgeable minority in the center. Unfortunately, voter ignorance does seem to have a shape." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Political%20scientists%20have,have%20a%20shape.)

> "Voters have punished incumbents for droughts and shark attacks and rewarded them for recent sports victories. Caplan dismisses retrospective voting, quoting a pair of scholars who call it “no more rational than killing the pharaoh when the Nile does not flood.”" - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=voters%20have%20punished%20incumbents%20for%20droughts%20and%20shark%20attacks%20and%20rewarded%20them%20for%20recent%20sports%20victories.%20Caplan%20dismisses%20retrospective%20voting%2C%20quoting%20a%20pair%20of%20scholars%20who%20call%20it%20%E2%80%9Cno%20more%20rational%20than%20killing%20the%20pharaoh%20when%20the%20Nile%20does%20not%20flood.%E2%80%9D)

what if we could maintain rankings such as "the top 10 or 50 things I think everyone should have read and/or seen" and "what are the top 10 most pressing issues" and have that surfaced objectively - by whoever dares to speak out - we could publicly rank our concerns

there should also be top 50/200/etc. - we should simply rank everything - vote with our actions in a global shared OS of events - events to which others can subscribe to

we can incentivize people to fill out questions to "complete their profile" and nudge them towards answering "top 10 civilizational concerns" - something they might have never even thought about.

# SECTION: Consciousness
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like.

To resolve tensions is to get things flowing — that is, towards realizing the mission. At the risk of oversimplification, let’s break it down:
>
> - Mission. This is why the organization exists and is the end all roles serve. (Because large-scale societies don’t have missions, decentralization is vital.)
>
> - Holacracy Constitution. Sets out the relatively fixed protocols and rules that compose Holacracy’s open-source social operating system.
>
> - Tactical Meetings. A group process for addressing one-off, operational issues in a formalized way, relevant to some functional sphere of activity.
>
> - Governance Meetings. A group process for creating roles, making policies, or assigning ownership of responsibilities.

> - Information management. The inputs and output of circle meetings are recorded so anyone can see the rules, roles, and policies at any time." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied)

> "With the holonic structure of circles within circles, we can imagine a greater encompassing supercircle composed of members of lower-order circles. This is an abstract way of describing something similar to a subsidiarity rule, which means decision-making authority should be devolved to the most local feasible level.

> "Anarchy comes from the greek “an”, meaning without, plus “arkhos”, meaning rulers. Anarchy doesn’t mean without rules, but without rulers. If you have the right rules, the absence of top-down rulers doesn’t remove order — it simply enables order to emerge dynamically from peer-to-peer interactions distributed throughout a system, one tension at a time. So by this definition, you could describe Holacracy as a rule system for humans working together in anarchy — with rules, but without rulers." - [Brian Robertson](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Anarchy%20comes%20from%20the%20greek,with%20rules%2C%20but%20without%20rulers.)

> "- Roles instead of job descriptions: The building blocks of Holacracy's organizational structure are roles. Holacracy distinguishes between roles and the people who fill them, as one individual can hold multiple roles at any given time. A role is not a job description; its definition follows a clear format including a name, a purpose, optional "domains" to control, and accountabilities, which are ongoing activities to perform. Roles are defined by each circle—or team—via a collective governance process, and are updated regularly in order to adapt to the ever-evolving needs of the organization.
>
> - Circle structure: Holacracy structures the various roles in an organization in a system of self-organizing (but not self-directed) circles. Circles are organized hierarchically, and each circle is assigned a clear purpose and accountabilities by its broader circle. However, each circle has the authority to self-organize internally to best achieve its goals. Circles conduct their own governance meetings, assign members to fill roles, and take responsibility for carrying out work within their domain of authority. Circles are connected by two roles known as "lead link" and "rep link", which sit in the meetings of both their circle and the broader circle to ensure alignment with the broader organization's mission and strategy.
>
> - Governance process: Each circle uses a defined governance process to create and regularly update its own roles and policies. Holacracy specifies a structured process known as "integrative decision making" for proposing changes in governance and amending or objecting to proposals. This is not a consensus-based system, not even a consent-based system, but one that integrates relevant input from all parties and ensures that the proposed changes and objections to those changes are anchored in the roles' needs (and through them, the organization's needs), rather than people's preferences or ego.
>
> - Operational process: Holacracy specifies processes for aligning teams according to operational needs, and requires that each member of a circle fulfill certain duties in order to work efficiently and effectively together. There are also key roles to help organise the process and workflow of each circle including Facilitator, Secretary, Lead Link, and Rep Link.
>
> In contrast to the governance process, which is collective and integrative, each member filling a role has a lot of autonomy and authority to make decisions on how to best achieve his or her goals. Some have described the authority paradigm in Holacracy as completely opposite to the one of the traditional management hierarchy; instead of needing permission to act or innovate, Holacracy gives blanket authority to take any action needed to perform the work of the roles, unless it is restricted via policies in governance or it involves spending some assets of the organization (money, intellectual property, etc.) Holacracy is highly biased toward action and innovation: it defaults to autonomy and freedom, then uses internal processes to limit that autonomy when its use in a specific way turns out to be detrimental." - [Holacracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy#:~:text=Roles%20instead%20of,to%20be%20detrimental.)

I cooperate with the people in the set and I try to join sets of successful individuals. So the extension to classical evolutionary game theory here is in classic evolutionary game theory, people imitate successful strategies.

> "In other words, cooperation in groups on a genetic basis tends to be self-destructive. This may be clarified by introducing the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy. The strategy of the altruists, helping others even if they do not reciprocate the help, may lead to an increased fitness for the group but it is not stable, since it can be easily invaded by egoistic strategies that take advantage of the altruists' sacrifice, but without giving anything in return. Though the selfish strategies will globally lead to a decrease of fitness for the group, they are locally stronger than the altruist strategies. This is another expression of the principle of suboptimization: genetic evolution works at the level of the subsystem (the individual or the individual together with his kin), and what is optimal at that level will be selected, even though it is far from optimal at the level of the group. Campbell has summed up this predicament by the phrase "genetic competition among the cooperators": on the level of the genes rivalry continues, and that will eventually erode any cooperation on the level of the group." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Selection for reciprocal altruism
>
> The characteristics of "tit for tat" (and of the other more successful strategies) can be summarized by three concepts: 1) the strategy is "nice": this means that it will never be the first to defect; 2) the strategy is "provocable": if the opponent defects, it retaliates by defecting too; 3) the strategy is "forgiving": as soon as the opponent cooperates again, the strategy forgets about the previous defection, and cooperates.
>
> Niceness is advantageous because it opens the way to mutually beneficial cooperation. Retaliation is necessary in order to avoid being invaded by selfish profiteers. Forgivingness has the advantage of avoiding mutual rounds of retaliation. Indeed, suppose that an individual because of distrust, by way of test or just because of a misunderstanding would defect just once, then a non- forgiving strategy would continue to defect in reaction, and mutual cooperation could never emerge or be restored.
>
> In a second study Axelrod generalized his game theoretic simulation to an evolutionary setting. In this setting, fitness was explicitly introduced by giving a strategy an amount of offspring proportional to the number of points it got in the previous tournament. The tournament was then repeated by playing all members of the new population of strategies (in which more successful strategies were now more numerous) against each other. Again the points of this tournament were used to produce a second generation of offspring. This generation played a following tournament, and so on. After many generations the less successful strategies would have been eliminated by natural selection, while the most successful ones would become more and more numerous. This setting is not equivalent to the previous one, since the fitness of the strategies depends on the opponents against which they play, and the field of opponents changes in the course of the simulated evolution. Hence a strategy that is successful in the original field of opponents may no longer be fit after the field has drastically changed. Yet Axelrod found out that it was still "tit for tat" that was most successful.
>
> However, "tit for tat" does not turn out to be an evolutionary stable strategy in the strict sense. Indeed, once the field is dominated by "tit for tat", other strategies that are less retaliatory (or more forgiving) become as fit as "tit for tat" since there are no longer cheaters to take advantage from their unconditional altruism. However, once a sufficient percentage of strategies becomes too altruistic, selfish strategies can again gain in fitness by exploiting their altruism. The end result seems to be some kind of equilibrium mixture of strategies in which reciprocal altruists such as "tit for tat" dominate, but in which there may also appear small amounts of "nasty" (the opposite of "nice") strategies together with non-retaliating altruists.
>
> In how far can these simulation results be generalized to real evolution? The most important restriction in the experiment seems to be that opponents interact with each other for a long, consecutive sequence of exchanges. This may be true for two individuals engaged in a close and stable relation. Reciprocal altruism may thus explain how a symbiotic relationship between two organisms can develop (e.g. a hermit crab and the sea anemone living on its shell) (cf. Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). In the kind of situations involving a large number of individuals that interest us, on the other hand, it seems more likely that opponents will encounter each other only once, or now and then with long interruptions and exchanges with different opponents in between.
>
> "Tit for tat" is only successful in an indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. If there is only one transaction, no retaliation is possible afterwards, and rationality dictates that you should defect. If there is a finite number of transactions, it pays to defect during the last one, but if you expect your opponent to defect at the last one, you should also defect at the last-but-one, and hence your opponent would be wise to already defect at the last-but-two, and so on. Hence games with a fixed number (known by the participants) of transactions would lead to continuous defection. In practice, that does not seem to be the problem, since normally opponents do not know how often they will meet each other again.
>
> However, the basic practical limitation is that of memory: the reciprocal altruist should not only remember how his opponent treated him during the last transaction (which may be a long time ago) he should also be able to recognize and distinguish all opponents with whom he has ever had transactions. This requirement does not seem to be realistic in large groups, such as human societies. Moreover, in such large systems, many encounters will take place for the first (and perhaps the last) time. In such cases reciprocal altruism does no good, and the "nice" individual who starts by cooperating may be cheated most of the time by others he will never see again. When I buy something in a shop in a city where I will never come back again, I do not expect to be cheated (though that is possible of course), even though I have no power to retaliate. In conclusion, reciprocal altruism seems still insufficient to explain the ultrasociality of human society." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The basic weakness of reciprocal altruism in explaining ultrasociality is that it starts from dyadic relationships, of the type "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine". It is difficult to imagine how such one-to-one exchanges could be enlarged in order to form the basis for large collective organizations. Therefore we would like to see some evolutionary stable strategy that directs behaviour towards groups rather than towards other individuals.
>
> It has been proposed that one such strategy is moralism, that is to say behavior that rewards or reinforces altruistic behavior by others, and punishes or inhibits cheating or defection. For example, Trivers (1971) has postulated selection for "moralistic aggression", and Lorenz (1975) speaks about "innate ethical sense". The advantage of moralism compared to pure altruism is that the costs of moralizing towards others are clearly less than those of being altruistic yourself (Campbell, 1983). However, if everybody around you is continuously moralizing, and ready to ostracize or even kill you if you do not behave altruistically, it becomes quite difficult to behave in a selfish way. Hence groups consisting of moralizing individuals will also tend to be altruistic, though the individuals are not motivated to be altruistic on their own. Moralism is also more stable than real altruism because cheaters will find it very difficult to invade a population that tends to make their life as difficult as possible. A disadvantage of moralism is that it encourages hypocrisy, that is to say behavior that does everything to look altruistic but is in fact selfish.
>
> A basic weakness of the argument is that it is difficult to imagine how something as complicated as an "ethical sense" might develop through genetic evolution. It seems quite difficult to put down rules distinguishing moral or altruistic behavior from selfish behavior that are applicable to all situations and all individuals. We might perhaps imagine the evolution of simple behavior patterns such as aggressive reactions against the selfish wolf who does not want the others of the pack to share in the food, but that does not seem sufficient to explain ultrasociality.
>
> Another weakness of the moralistic selection argument, is that moralism mainly functions to maintain an already functioning cooperation system, by reducing the fitness of those who do not obey the rules. However, the argument does not explain how the cooperative pattern, and the moralistic attitude that maintains it, may have developed from selfish behavior in the first place." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The theory of natural selection on the basis of fitness is in principle applicable to all replicating systems, not only to genes. Recently, a new type of replicator has been proposed as a unit of cultural evolution. Memes are defined as cognitive or behavioral patterns that can be transmitted from one individual to another one by learning and imitation (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz, 1991). Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society, almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language, fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts, conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any replication at the level of the genes. Storing a concept or a habit in memory after having encountered it through another individual, does not require any change of the DNA." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Though that process will be subjected to the same basic principles of blind variation and natural selection on the basis of fitness, memetic evolution is basically a much more flexible mechanism. Genes can only be transmitted from parents (or parent in the case of asexual reproduction) to offspring. Memes can in principle be transmitted between any two individuals (though it will become more difficult the larger the differences in cognitive mechanisms and language are).
>
> For genes to be transmitted, you typically need one generation, which for higher organism means several years. Memes can be transmitted in the space of hours. Meme spreading is also much faster than gene spreading, because gene replication is restricted by the rather small number of offspring a single parent can have, whereas the amount of individuals that can take over a meme from a single individual is almost unlimited. Moreover, it seems much easier for memes to undergo variation, since the information in the nervous system is more plastic than that in the DNA, and since individuals can come into contact with much more different sources of novel memes. On the other hand, selection processes can be more efficient because of "vicarious" selection: the meme carrier himself does not need to be killed in order to eliminate an inadequate meme; it can suffice that he witnesses or hears about the troubles of another individual due to that same meme.
>
> The conclusion is that memetic evolution will be several orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than genetic evolution. It should not surprise us then that during the last ten thousand years, humans have almost not changed on the genetic level, whereas their culture (i.e. the total set of memes) has undergone the most radical developments. In practice the superior "evolvability" of memes would also mean that in cases where genetic and memetic replicators are in competition, we would expect the memes to win in the long term, even though the genes would start with the advantage of a well- established, stable structure." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Meme fitness will depend basically on three factors: 1) survivability of the carrier; 2) individual learnability of memes; 3) tendency of memes to spread or to be transmitted. The first criterion is similar to the one determining gene selection, so we won't go into much detail about it. Basically it states that, all other things being equal, memes leading to decreased probability of a carrier's survival, e.g. because they are bad for the health, or lead to dangerous or suicidal behavior, will tend to be eliminated. However, we must add that survival is to be interpreted on the level of the group of all carriers, rather than on the level of the individual." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is this contagiousness that most strikingly differentiates meme selection from gene selection. Genes, indeed, are not contagious. You can never get a gene, that you did not already have, from someone else. At most you can produce a child that shares some of your genes with some genes of another person." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "All memes have the implicit goal of making their carriers more fit, since an increased number of carriers signifies that there will be more memory space available for meme replication. If, as we have argued previously, cooperation among the carriers tends to increase the overall fitness of the group of carriers, it will be in the interest of memes to promote that cooperation. Moreover, since cooperation requires communication, and since meme spreading critically depends on communication, the "motivation" of memes to bolster cooperation should be even stronger than that of genes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The selective advantage does not mean that the less fit group will be physically eliminated during the competition with the cooperative group. On the level of memes, elimination can happen when the selfish group gives up its belief in the meme for selfishness and adopts the meme for altruism from the other group. This conversion of one group by another one may happen by direct physical force, for example because the altruist group is better organized to win a war between the groups, and can thus subdue the other one. It can also happen in a peaceful way because the less successful group simply imitates the more successful one.

> The basic argument against group selection is that group strategies can be easily invaded. However, that is not the case for memetic strategies. Indeed, suppose that a "mutant" meme promoting selfishness would appear in an altruist group. According to genetic reasoning, its carrier would be more fit than an altruist one, since he can profit from the altruism of the other carriers without paying the corresponding costs. However, the fitness of a meme is different from the fitness of its carrier. Though the selfish carrier might have enhanced fitness in the sense that he gets more food or other resources, the fitness of the meme he carries depends on how easily other members of the group can be converted to it.

> Now memes are selfish, which means that they have the implicit goal of thwarting all rival memes that compete for the same memory space. Hence the majority meme in the group will tend to consolidate the memory space it already occupies in the majority of carriers. A likely mechanism for that might be that the different carriers continuously reinforce each other's belief by communication and imitation. The carrier of the mutant meme, on the other hand, is alone and does not get any reinforcement from his fellows. He will find it very difficult to convert any of them to his non-conformist ideas, since the influence on any individual of a majority of conformists will be much stronger than that of a single dissident. This tendency of the majority meme to impose itself on minorities leads to intra-group homogeneity, as confirmed by Boyd and Richerson's (1985) mathematical model of cultural evolution" - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Memes will even succeed in transcending the problem of the genetic competition between the cooperators... Our criticism of the argument on the basis of moralism, namely that a complete ethical system seems too complex to evolve by genetic selection, does not apply to memetic evolution, which is much faster, and which adapts more readily to abstract models of the world." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "When two individuals, after sufficient interactions, have reached a stable cooperative relationship or pact, based on reciprocity, that agreement or convention can be viewed as a meme with two carriers. If there is communication, that same meme can be transferred to a third and a fourth carrier, and so on, who would thus come to join the convention. Indeed, an individual who observes an existing reciprocal relationship between two other individuals, and who notices the advantages following from their mutual cooperation, would be tempted to imitate their behavior. If a certain behavioral pattern tends to be imitated, that makes it a meme by definition. If that meme, in addition to it being contagious, also furthers the genetic fitness of its carriers, we may conclude that it has a high memetic fitness, and thus will tend to replace rival memes with a lower fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The limitations on memory that make reciprocity difficult for large groups, can also be evaded by memetic mechanisms. Indeed, a meme can easily evolve mechanisms for making members of the same cultural group easy to recognize. Individuals belonging to the same culture or ethnical group will usually distinguish themselves by clearly perceivable attributes or behavior... If such signs allow you to identify a member of your group, you can expect that he will also follow the group's agreement on reciprocity, and hence you can trust that he will cooperate, without you having to renegotiate a pact. If he does not, you can still alarm the other members of your group, and he will be subjected to moralistic aggression. In that sense it is to the advantage of both the group and separate individuals to wear the appropriate attributes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Many ethical systems explicitly refer to the ideal of "fraternity", and sometimes members of the same cultural group (e.g. monks or Freemasons) are supposed to call each other "brother". Though these are not brothers in the biological sense, the meme attempts to harness the innate tendency to behave altruistically towards kin and to use it for purposes different from the increase of genetic inclusive fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is possible to discern a clear progression from pure selfishness, to kin-restricted limited altruism, to "tit for tat" based dyads, to multi-individual reciprocal agreements, to moralism and group ideologies, and finally to the complex ultrasocial systems of cooperation characterizing present society." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "With the capacity for language appears the capacity to rapidly spread complex memes, and that gives memes a definite advantage over genes in directing further evolution. In recent times, the memes that seem to be dominating are those that tend to make the ideal of altruism or brotherliness universal, ignoring the distinctions created by older memes such as languages or religions. We will not go into detail about why that is happening but note that the evolutionary tendency towards more and more far-reaching or inclusive cooperation seems to continue, albeit with many ups and downs. Such an evolution towards stronger integration of subsystems, allowing optimization at the global level, is exemplified by Turchin's concept of a metasystem transition. Such an evolutionary transition is characterized by the appearance of a control system at the metalevel, steering and optimizing the actions of the subsystems at the level below." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "A basic conclusion of our general analysis is that you need communication before you can have cooperation, that is to say information must be shared. In organisms cooperating because of kin selection, the medium of communication is sexual reproduction: genetic "messages" are transmitted through special cells (sperm or egg cells) that cannot survive or develop independently of the process of sexual reproduction. It is this shared information that creates the connection between parents and offspring or, indirectly, between relatives. In primitive multicellular organisms, such as algae, the "communication" might be based on simple spatial contiguity (sharing of the same location). In complex organisms where there is differentiation of functions among cells, you need special chemical signals to coordinate the different cells (this can be modelled by "genetic networks", Kauffmann, 1991). In sociocultural systems, the basic medium supporting cooperation is meme spreading." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The complete evolutionary sequence would be something of the following form: competition, communication, stable interaction patterns, internal models of pattern, shared models, shared replicators, cooperation promoted by shared replicators, integration with the shared replicators as coordinators. In Turchin's terminology, the shared information will become a control for the systems of the level below, coordinating, monitoring and directing their cooperation. Hence the process of development of cooperation between initially competing subsystems through the development of shared replicators can be seen as a true metasystem transition." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is clear that the whole issue of how competing subsystems can start to cooperate and thus become (partly or completely) integrated into a globally optimizing supersystem is very complex. Many questions about cooperation, shared information, and higher levels of control still have to be answered. Yet I think it is equally obvious that these problems are of the utmost importance if we wish to understand our own further evolution, as individuals, as a species, as a culture, or as parts of the global world system." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)
