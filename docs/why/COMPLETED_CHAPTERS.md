> "Gods in a sense are not physical entities - they are representations of agents existing across people." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1422)

> "But what happens if we make this God more general? In the philosophy of [Thomas Aquinas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas) and Aristotle you find this notion. Aquinas in some sense defines God as the best possible most top-level collective agent and it can be discovered through rational inference about thinking about what is the best possible most top-level collective agent in an open ended process that requires a lot of thought and it's not going to be finished anytime soon? And it's enacted - this end agent - by all those people or individuals who recognize this entity and decide to serve it. And this leads to the harmonic organization of a civilization. According to Aquinas we can understand individuals as rational agents and a rational agent should basically follow policies for organizing itself. Aquinas identifies individual policies for rational agents that he calls the [practical virtues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues). For instance a rational agent should always optimize its internal organization which he calls temperance. And it should optimize the organization to other agents which he calls justice, right, keep the books balanced. And you should pick goals and strategies that you can rationally justify, which he calls prudence. and you should be willing to act on your models - get the right balance between exploration and exploitation in the strategies - which he calls courage. But these rational strategies do not by themselves lead to a harmonic society - to do this you need collective policies and Aquinas sees society as a multi-agent system and you get the optimal social organization by creating a collectively enacted agent. And this collectively enacted agent emerges over three policies according to Aquinas: the first one is you do need to commit to serve the optimal collective agent which he calls faith. And then you need to do this not by yourself but together with all the others that serve these sacred purposes above their ego which is called love. And you need to be willing to invest into that thing before it comes into existence because otherwise it will not exist, right, if you wait for it to exist so it can reward you - it will never happen - and this willingness to invest into it before it exists is what he calls hope. These are very rational policies for Collective agency. So when we define God as the best possible most top level agent and we commit to serving this transcended agency we can create foundations for universal morality. And this universal morality before Enlightenment has been in some sense the defining morality of the West - the concept of divine will: what would God want if God did exist through us enacting God - the best possible agent. And it's something that we lost in our civilization - it's still in the German Constitution, but it's something that a lot of people don't really understand anymore. And so we try after this demise of the concept of divine will to come up with different foundations for ethics." - [Joscha Bach](https://youtu.be/PrSiZPDqk1c?t=1564)

god is the abstraction of social systems

God is whats beyond the individual


What if you could delegate your weights/votes not to identities but to entire weighted sets - gods?
What if you could say “Amplify what my god thinks” - and then we can track the success rate of battling gods in the reputational battleground

Your god is the morality you can point to

This is the final step in the long arc of god’s evolution

God is comprised of the intersection of all sub-gods in a polytheistic evolutionary landscape and the people who first bet on features of their sub-gods that eventually become part of that intersection will get rewarded

> "Society in general, simply by its effect on men's minds, undoubtedly has all that is required to arouse the sensation of the divine. A society is to its members what a god is to its faithful.

> "A society whose members are united by the fact that they think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1204111)

> "Society is not a mere sum of individuals. Rather, the system formed by their association represents a specific reality which has its own characteristics... The group thinks, feels, and acts quite differently from the way in which its members would were they isolated. If, then, we begin with the individual, we shall be able to understand nothing of what takes place in the group." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/541413)

> "Man is only a moral being because he lives in society, since morality consists in solidarity with the group, and varies according to that solidarity. Cause all social life to vanish, and moral life would vanish at the same time, having no object to cling to." - [Émile Durkheim](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/541412)

OMEGA POINT STUFF BY BOBBY AZARIAN GOES HERE

"love and truth are the two primary manifestations of divinity in which we can partake and that in partaking in them we become truer manifestations of the divine" - robert wright, the evolution of god

we can create the god that binds us all in the most productive, positive and functional way

Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

God allows us to ask the question “What is my purpose” and then get an option along with a path for how to get there. You can get multiple options that are personalized to you

God is the search engine of meaning in life

The god of the 21st century is the most just of all

God is the planetary nervous system of humanity

(Sovereign) identity is the key to god

God is the fairness protocol

God is the purest form of cooperation - the most efficient one - achievable only with maximal alignment which requires trust through  transparency and reputation.

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

God is leaving the world better after yourself

We need something that would sell itself

God is a story and we can choose him

God is an attractor - an aspiration. God is always further - there’s always more to improve. God delivers protopia - by terhering our values as the source of everything for meaning

God is the answer to meaning - god is what we create. God is what we contribute to - that’s god. The evolution of culture - the human spirit

So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

^^ Not sure about this...

> "We can plunder all the religious and philosophical history and check out what were the ideas that really survived what were ideas that were timeless and that turns out to be the ideas that concerned humans and what were the ideas that were time specific oh they turned out to be the the concern technology that concerned equality is like learning and reading and speaking and writing or whatever we humans do or artistic expression okay that's what changes over time now if we know that if you see that pattern we can then construct a value system that works for us today and because it concerns a new paradigm as nietzsche would say and we have a freedom then to be creative about this we call that process paradigmatics so what we're creating today is a system of values that work for us and that development is with metamodernism for example today's interest it is interested in what kind of values do we co-create here so we get the really creative discussion and conversation but also that the little genius among us that need their own space to work in the little monasteries to construct whatever they can construct can also do that and so we can also embrace that engineers and traders are creating enormous value and they need our support they might even need some kind of religious direction." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=4657)

> "Noocracy ( where nous means 'wise' and kratos means 'rule' therefore 'rule of the wise' ) is a form of government where decision making is done by wise people. The idea is proposed by various philosophers such as [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha), [al-Farabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Farabi) and [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius)." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Noocracy%20(/,and%20Confucius.)

> "The irrationality of voters inherent in democracies can be explained by two major behavioral and cognitive patterns. Firstly, most of the voters think that the marginal contribution of their vote will not make a difference on election outcomes; therefore, they do not find it useful to inform themselves on political matters. In other terms, due to the required time and effort of acquiring new information, voters rationally prefer to remain ignorant. Moreover, it has been shown that most citizens process political information in deeply biased, partisan, motivated ways rather than in dispassionate, rational ways. This psychological phenomenon causes voters to strongly identify themselves with a certain political group, specifically find evidence to support arguments aligning with their preferred ideological inclinations, and eventually vote with a high level of bias." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=The%20irrationality%20of,level%20of%20bias.)

> "Supporters of noocracy see a greater danger in the fact that politicians will actually prefer to implement the policy decisions of citizens to win elections and stabilize their power, without paying particular attention to the content and further outcomes of these policies. In democracies, the problem is that voters are prone to make bad policy decisions and therefore that politicians are incentivized to implement these policies due to personal benefits." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=supporters%20of%20noocracy,to%20personal%20benefits.)

> "Christiano proposes a ruling system based on division of political labor, in which citizens set the agenda for political discussions and determine the aims of the society, whereas legislators are in charge of deciding on the means to achieve these aims. For noocrats, transferring the decision-making mechanism to a body of specifically trained, specialized and experienced body is expected to result in superior and more efficient policy outcomes." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Christiano%20proposes%20a,efficient%20policy%20outcomes.)

> "Singapore has a political system that favors meritocracy; the path to government in Singapore is structured in such a way that only those with above-average skills are identified with strict university-entrance exams, recruiting processes, etc., and then rigorously trained to be able to devise best the solutions that benefit the entire society. In the words of the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore is a society based on effort and merit, not wealth or privilege depending on birth. This system primarily works due to citizens’ belief that political leaders tend to have a better understanding of country's long-term plans than themselves; therefore, as they see positive policy outcomes, they tend to go along with the system, rather than complain about the meritocratic dimensions." - [Noocracy, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noocracy#:~:text=Singapore%20has%20a,the%20meritocratic%20dimensions.)

One big problem with meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy is that we've been unable to compute the reputation objectively for accountability. They've been often criticised as idealistic/unrealistic and flawed but that's because we haven't had a reliable mechanism to surface competence together with accountability. Proxies such as accreditation have proven bad.
Another criticism is one of lack of diversity and the superior results of the wisdom of crowds. But we can design a meritocracy/epistocracy/technocracy/noocracy however we like in order to maximize the collective intelligence of as many people as possible - it doesn't have to be a small clique of people that make all the contributions.
Also we can separate decision making from values & overall direction & goals so that we all get an equal vote for the values & direction.


> "What is a Meritocracy? The holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=What%20is%20a,of%20their%20ability.)

> "A meritocracy (in theory) is where we judge people on the basis of their individual abilities rather than their position in the social hierarchy or their family connections. For most of human history, we have not lived in anything resembling a meritocracy. Until recently, the most important institution in society was the family. You inherited your position and defined your identity as a member of a family. As a result, society was much more static than it is now. Social mobility was low, and all that mattered was who you knew. You didn’t get jobs on merit –  they were regarded as things that people owned and could pass down to their children. What meritocracy did was create a new kind of aristocracy. The only alternative to the aristocracy of land and inheritance was to replace it with an aristocracy of virtue and talent." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=A%20meritocracy%20(in,virtue%20and%20talent.)

> "The strongest criticism of meritocracy is not that there's something bad about the idea of putting the best people in charge. The critique is that the best people are not in charge... The ruling elite aren’t actually the best, they just got lucky or won thanks to kleptocracy." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20strongest%20criticism,thanks%20to%20kleptocracy.)

> "It was always tricky to discern talent and effort from parents and social class and environment. To unbundle what's in your control (merit) from what isn't (circumstance). Which leads to irresolvable conflict over who's the "best" & who "earns" it. In one sense it’s a fair process in that, in a successful meritocracy, whoever’s the best, should get it. But in another sense it’s unfair in that people didn’t get the same chance. Because of biological or cultural factors, or just sheer luck, not everyone had the same starting line. And this is the fatal flaw of the term meritocracy — it is about who wins the race but, in its quest to be fair, implies there’s an equal starting line." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=it%20was%20always,equal%20starting%20line.)

> "And if we don’t literally mean *equality* of opportunity, let’s just say “sufficient opportunity for all”, meaning we focus on constantly expanding absolute opportunity, without focusing on relative opportunity. Indeed, we should focus on expanding opportunity for all, we should focus on equal treatment under the law for all." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=And%20if%20we,law%20for%20all)

> "Everything you love is a result of inequality. When you seek a mate, do you want someone who is exactly average, just like everyone else, or do you want someone who is special? When you have kids, do you want them to have the same life outcomes as every other kid in the world, or do you want them to do better than that? When you have a job, do you aspire to turn in absolutely average performance, to be careful not to ever exceed the performance of your peers? Or do you aspire to do the best you can, even if that means you do better than your peers? Is it moral to want the best surgeon, the best teachers, or the best spouse to raise a family with?" - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Everything%20you%20love,a%20family%20with%3F)

> "Belief in an aristocracy of talent is self-fulfilling. If people believe the best people can rise up, and that effort impacts outcomes, they’ll work for it. Which is why threading this needle matters: The best people should be in charge, via a transparent process where anyone can prove they’re the best, but also accepting that people had different opportunities to begin with. In other words, we’re all running the same race, but at different starting lines. And that’s OK. Let’s try to move up everyone’s starting lines, without trying to hold anyone back, and more importantly, let’s try to maximize how far everyone can go." - [On Meritocracy, by Erik Torenberg](https://eriktorenberg.substack.com/p/on-meritocracy#:~:text=Belief%20in%20an,everyone%20can%20go.)

> "The quality of a meritocracy is a product of (1) the team of people and (2) the way those people interact with each other. A meritocracy (and the business itself) is ultimately judged by its (3) outcomes (i.e., performance relative to goals). We spend time defining and measuring the effectiveness of our team and our interactions because we believe that they drive the outcomes on which the company depends directly and that they also drive our outcomes over the longer-term." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20quality%20of,the%20longer%2Dterm)

> "We are aiming for interactions that get the best out of individuals and the team, with truth and a deep desire to excel at their core. We think great leadership in this context is lots of “people in the arena”, meaning people who will relentlessly pursue truth wherever it takes them and who are totally unwilling to be on the sidelines. This means they are: (1) speaking up and exposing their honest thoughts and willing to be wrong, (2) unafraid to be transparent about their stumbles, imperfections, and decision-making and, (3) seeking to find the best ideas and get the most out of others through deliberate inclusion." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=We%20are%20aiming,through%20deliberate%20inclusion.)

> "The more unsure you are and the more assumptions you’re making, the more important it is to engage with curiosity rather than starting with assertions or certainty. In a meritocracy, greatness isn’t being the best debater, winning the most arguments, or personally having the right answer most often. It’s being honest about what you truly think while engaging with deep humility and the intent to learn, and in doing so increasing the probability of the team succeeding. Every member of the community has a responsibility to be honest and direct, and we expect a constant flow of feedback in all directions. It is most critical that feedback flow from those with less power to those with more, not because those with less power should bear the greatest burden, but because there are relatively more challenges to feedback moving in that direction — everything from power dynamics to frequency of interaction. In line with that everyone, but most especially leaders, has a responsibility not just to solicit honesty from others, but to assess whether that’s actually happening across all levels and if not, to diagnose why." - [Bridgewater’s Idea Meritocracy](https://www.bridgewater.com/culture/bridgewaters-idea-meritocracy#:~:text=The%20more%20unsure,to%20diagnose%20why.)

> "Focusing on outcomes increases the probability of a good design because it forces you to evaluate whether the team and interactions are sufficient to achieve what you want.

Jim Rutt Show EP #32: Jason Brennan on Irrational Democracy & Academia
epistocracy !!!
Problems with democracy and voters:
- people disinterested in politics - not voting at all
- very low understanding of what is going on
- systematic misinformation - not just ignorance - ppl get the facts wrong
- different responses to political questions even after just 1 week without anything having changed - random answers
- partisanship, tribalism & confirmation (& disconfirmation) bias
- ignorance, apathy, irrationality
- no skin in the game
- position bias (pick the first thing, pay less attention to anything other than the 1st page, etc.)
- likeability - superficial features of candidates
- error doesn't cancel out in the real world - it compounds
- inconsequentiality and bad incentives (a built-in defect in democratic voting) - our votes don't really matter - why be engaged and spend a ton of time to be informed when most others won't put in the same effort and you're just 1 vote out of millions of other votes? The incentive is to be ignorant. Rational irrationality - (instrumental rationality vs epistemic rationality) - promoting your ends vs truth seeking

> "Most people believe democracy is a uniquely just form of government. They believe people have the right to an equal share of political power. And they believe that political participation is good for us--it empowers us, helps us get what we want, and tends to make us smarter, more virtuous, and more caring for one another. These are some of our most cherished ideas about democracy. But, Jason Brennan says, they are all wrong." - [Against Democracy, by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy#:~:text=Most%20people%20believe,are%20all%20wrong.)

> "We have to ask ourselves what we think government is actually for. Some people think it has the value a painting has, which is to say that it’s symbolic. In that view, you might think, “We should have democracy because it’s a way of civilizing and expressing the idea that all of us have equal value.”
>
> There’s another way of looking at government, which is that it’s a tool, like a hammer, and the purpose of politics is to generate just and good outcomes, to generate efficiency and stability, and to avoid mistreating people. So if you think government is for that purpose, and I do, then you have to wonder if we should pick the form of government that best delivers the goods, whatever that might be." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20to,that%20might%20be.)

> "There was a time in British history ([from around 1600 until 1950](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-history-of-university-representation/)) where people who had college degrees would get an extra vote, but this was a stupid idea. It pains me to say this as an educator, but it turns out that university education has very little impact on how much people know. In general, college-educated people know more than non-college-educated people, but it’s not the college that’s making the difference." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=There%20was%20a,making%20the%20difference.)

> "Every kind of political system is abused, and we should guard against that. Here’s what I propose we do: Everyone can vote, even children. No one gets excluded. But when you vote, you do three things.
>
> First, you tell us what you want. You cast your vote for a politician, or for a party, or you take a position on a referendum, whatever it might be. Second, you tell us who you are. We get your demographic information, which is anonymously coded, because that stuff affects how you vote and what you support.And the third thing you do is take a quiz of very basic political knowledge. When we have those three bits of information, we can then statistically estimate what the public would have wanted if it was fully informed.
>
> Under this system, it’s not really the case that you have more power than I do. We can’t really point to any individual and say you were excluded, or your vote counted for more. The idea is to gauge what the public would actually want if it had all the information it needed." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=Every%20kind%20of,information%20it%20needed.)

> "Here’s my paradoxical-sounding idea: Let democracy decide what goes on the test." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=here%E2%80%99s%20my%20paradoxical%2Dsounding%20idea%3A%20Let%20democracy%20decide%20what%20goes%20on%20the%20test.)

> "If you survey people and ask them what it takes to be an informed voter, they say the same kinds of things I would say, but you quickly find out that many of them don’t know the answers... Voters know in the abstract what they ought to know; they just don’t actually know the things they think they should." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=If%20you%20survey,think%20they%20should.)

> "We have the right to choose our partner, to choose our religion, to choose what we’re going to eat, where we live, what job we’ll do, etc. While some of these things do impose costs on others, they’re primarily about carving out a sphere of autonomy for the individual, and about preventing other people from having control over you.
>
> A right to participate in politics seems fundamentally different because it involves imposing your will upon other people. So I’m not sure that any of us should have that kind of right, at least not without any responsibilities." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=We%20have%20the,without%20any%20responsibilities.)

> "This is a weird metaphor, but imagine I couldn’t move my arms because they were tied. But then you were to give me coffee whenever I wanted it. That’s kind of what’s going on in a democracy: I’m still getting the coffee, and that’s awesome, but I’m not actually responsible for the coffee getting into my mouth — you’re the one that’s doing it. No matter how you look at it, it’s really the group that has the power, not the individual, even if we’re in the group that has the power." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=This%20is%20a,has%20the%20power.)

> "My worry is that people too often vote for basically arbitrary or historical reasons that have little to do with interests or ideologies. Certain identity groups get attached to certain parties and that’s just the way it is." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=My%20worry%20is%20that%20people%20too%20often%20vote%20for%20basically%20arbitrary%20or%20historical%20reasons%20that%20have%20little%20to%20do%20with%20interests%20or%20ideologies.%20Certain%20identity%20groups%20get%20attached%20to%20certain%20parties%20and%20that%E2%80%99s%20just%20the%20way%20it%20is.)

> "I like to say I’m a fan of democracy, and I’m also a fan of Iron Maiden, but I think Iron Maiden has quite a few albums that are terrible — and I think democracy is kind of like this. It’s great, it’s the best system we have so far, but we shouldn’t accept that it can’t be improved.
>
> We might recognize that it’s better than anything else we’ve tried, and yet we can also see that there are all these persistent pathologies that exist, and so we should be asking, “How can we fix them?” We should be constantly experimenting and discovering what works and what doesn’t." - [Jason Brennan](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/23/17581394/against-democracy-book-epistocracy-jason-brennan#:~:text=I%20like%20to,and%20what%20doesn%E2%80%99t.)

> "Roughly a third of American voters think that the Marxist slogan “From each according to his ability to each according to his need” appears in the Constitution. About as many are incapable of naming even one of the three branches of the United States government. Fewer than a quarter know who their senators are, and only half are aware that their state has two of them. Democracy is other people, and the ignorance of the many has long galled the few." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=that%20the%20Marxist,galled%20the%20few)

> "Political scientists have long hoped to find an “invisible hand” in politics comparable to the one that Adam Smith described in economics. Voter ignorance wouldn’t matter much if a democracy were able to weave individual votes into collective political wisdom, the way a market weaves the self-interested buy-and-sell decisions of individual actors into a prudent collective allocation of resources. But, as Brennan reports, the mathematical models that have been proposed work only if voter ignorance has no shape of its own—if, for example, voters err on the side of liberalism as often as they err on the side of conservatism, leaving decisions in the hands of a politically knowledgeable minority in the center. Unfortunately, voter ignorance does seem to have a shape." - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=Political%20scientists%20have,have%20a%20shape.)

> "Voters have punished incumbents for droughts and shark attacks and rewarded them for recent sports victories. Caplan dismisses retrospective voting, quoting a pair of scholars who call it “no more rational than killing the pharaoh when the Nile does not flood.”" - [The Case Against Democracy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/07/the-case-against-democracy#:~:text=voters%20have%20punished%20incumbents%20for%20droughts%20and%20shark%20attacks%20and%20rewarded%20them%20for%20recent%20sports%20victories.%20Caplan%20dismisses%20retrospective%20voting%2C%20quoting%20a%20pair%20of%20scholars%20who%20call%20it%20%E2%80%9Cno%20more%20rational%20than%20killing%20the%20pharaoh%20when%20the%20Nile%20does%20not%20flood.%E2%80%9D)

> "Wherever we find orderly, stable systems in Nature, we find that they are hierarchically structured, for the simple reason that without such structuring of complex systems into sub-assemblies, there could be no order and stability-except the order of a dead universe filled with a uniformly distributed gas." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652997-wherever-we-find-orderly-stable-systems-in-nature-we-find)

> "On successively higher levels of the hierarchy we find more complex, flexible and less predictable patterns of activity, while on successively lower levels we find more and more mechanised, stereotyped and predictable patterns. In the language of the physicist, a holon on a higher level of the hierarchy has more degrees of freedom than a holon on a lower level." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9653378-on-successively-higher-levels-of-the-hierarchy-we-find-more)

> "The self-assertive tendency is the dynamic expression of the holon's wholeness, the integrative tendency, the dynamic expression of its partness." - [Arthur Koestler](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9652981-no-man-is-an-island-he-is-a-holon-a-janus-faced#:~:text=the%20self%2Dassertive%20tendency%20is%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20the%20holon%27s%20wholeness%2C%20the%20integrative%20tendency%2C%20the%20dynamic%20expression%20of%20its%20partness.)

> "[Holacracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy) provides a governance framework that is decidedly [holonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)) — roughly, systems within systems. In this way, a holacratic organization approximates a living organism as opposed to a machine to be “designed” or “run.” Practitioners aren’t arranged by managers as cogs within a traditional org chart, but rather define their own functional roles within wider spheres of activity, or “circles.”
>
> Just as cells make up organs within organisms, people have roles within teams within organizations. And though certain cells and roles might hustle themselves into an “executive function,” both the organism’s and the holacratic organization’s brains are self-organizing." - [Fractal Governance Applied, by Max Borders](https://underthrow.substack.com/p/fractal-governance-applied#:~:text=Holacracy%20provides%20a,are%20self%2Dorganizing.)
