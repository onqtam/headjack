Is it a coincidence that one of the most important papers in AI/ML that introduced transformers was called `"Attention is all you need"`?

One of the most transformative (pun intended) papers in AI/ML is called ...

The importance of attention cannot be overstated

> "Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system." - [Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#:~:text=Attention%20is%20the%20flexible%20control%20of%20limited%20computational%20resources.%20Why%20those%20resources%20are%20limited%20and%20how%20they%20can%20best%20be%20controlled%20will%20vary%20across%20use%20cases%2C%20but%20the%20ability%20to%20dynamically%20alter%20and%20route%20the%20flow%20of%20information%20has%20clear%20benefits%20for%20the%20adaptiveness%20of%20any%20system.)

Attention has a cost - an opportunity cost. It is a resource and hence we "pay" attention
It also takes energy to process information and energy is just a resource as well


awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.
The phantom limb sensation is when the model is still operating according to the past - but the limb no longer exists. We still register the physical limb as present.

Humanity lacks a cohesive subjective awareness as a schematic model of itself - we lack an attention schema. We can't:
- control our attention
- model the attention of others and different groups of people

> "Awareness is the brain's way of describing to itself what it means to focus attention on something." - [Michael Graziano](https://youtu.be/H8twgvcA-Ko?t=349)
combining the capacity to build models and pay attention.

we are the agents of attention

> "What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it." - [Herbert A. Simon](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/herbert_a_simon_181919)

> "The kinds of AIs that optimize your news feed are higher power AIs than the AIs that beat Kasparov at chess. Kasparov is far better at chess than you are at controlling your attention, and he also knew he was playing a game." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://www.sloww.co/daniel-schmachtenberger/#:~:text=The%20kinds%20of%20AIs%20that%20optimize%20your%20news%20feed%20are%20higher%20power%20AIs%20than%20the%20AIs%20that%20beat%20Kasparov%20at%20chess.%20Kasparov%20is%20far%20better%20at%20chess%20than%20you%20are%20at%20controlling%20your%20attention%2C%20and%20he%20also%20knew%20he%20was%20playing%20a%20game.)

The fundamental issue of attention

> "I have long said that attention is the cursor of consciousness. This means that whoever or whatever controls my attention controls my consciousness, and whoever or whatever controls my consciousness ultimately determines who I actually am." - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb#:~:text=I%20have%20long%20said%20that%20attention%20is%20the%20cursor%20of%20consciousness.%20This%20means%20that%20whoever%20or%20whatever%20controls%20my%20attention%20controls%20my%20consciousness%2C%20and%20whoever%20or%20whatever%20controls%20my%20consciousness%20ultimately%20determines%20who%20I%20actually%20am.)

> "These reward stimuli affect our minds whenever we look at our phones. As a result, we’re being programmed to expect and desire a very unnatural state of immediacy. Compare this with how the brains of our species — which evolved in the material world — until very recently made use of our neuro-modulator-based psychological reward system. That system was called on far, far less frequently — certainly, not constantly." - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb#:~:text=These%20reward%20stimuli,certainly%2C%20not%20constantly.)

> "Today, things are different. We reach for our phones the instant the plane lands — or when we have 15 seconds of downtime in the grocery checkout line — not because our lives are so insanely fast that something actually needs our ATTENTION RIGHT NOW, but because we have been nonconsciously programmed to experience a neuromodulator reward whenever we take out our phone and get an inbound update, text message, email, or like. The same thing happens when we gain a false sense of “having found something useful” by scanning the news for what’s happening right this very minute with the dramatic political absurdities gripping our country." - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb#:~:text=Today%2C%20things%20are,gripping%20our%20country.)

> "In short, the instincts of our social hunter-gatherer brains — to seek social interaction and be constantly scanning the environment for food and sources of danger — have been co-opted to instead hook us on yet another like or incoming text message about something that is usually trivial, or is otherwise consciously designed (with the help of cutting-edge cognitive science) to manipulate us." - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20the,to%20manipulate%20us.)

> "In short, we have lost our cognitive sovereignty. We aren’t much more than trained lab rats when it comes to compulsively looking at our phones 80 to 300 times a day!" - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20we%20have%20lost%20our%20cognitive%20sovereignty.%20We%20aren%E2%80%99t%20much%20more%20than%20trained%20lab%20rats%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20compulsively%20looking%20at%20our%20phones%2080%20to%20300%20times%20a%20day!)

if you can insert a topic from the top-down that grabs 5-10% of the attention of people - you've reduced the attention over everything else by 5-10% as well - which you might want. Attention is the scarcest of resources

> "The community can decide which claims should get more eyeballs and which should not. For example, “Fauci lied to Congress” might be more important than “Kim Kardashian was wearing Chanel yesterday.”" - [Sensemaking in the Era of Authoritarian Media, by Max Borders](https://www.aier.org/article/sensemaking-in-the-era-of-authoritarian-media/#:~:text=the%20community%20can%20decide%20which%20claims%20should%20get%20more%20eyeballs%20and%20which%20should%20not.%20For%20example%2C%20%E2%80%9CFauci%20lied%20to%20Congress%E2%80%9D%20might%20be%20more%20important%20than%20%E2%80%9CKim%20Kardashian%20was%20wearing%20Chanel%20yesterday.%E2%80%9D)

> "When we look at our hardwired “attention allocation” functions, we discover that human beings use a pretty simple model: pay attention to the people who other people are paying attention to." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=when%20we%20look%20at%20our%20hardwired%20%E2%80%9Cattention%20allocation%E2%80%9D%20functions%2C%20we%20discover%20that%20human%20beings%20use%20a%20pretty%20simple%20model%3A%20pay%20attention%20to%20the%20people%20who%20other%20people%20are%20paying%20attention%20to.)

> "As a society, we are obsessed with who has attention, and conspicuously less interested in whether it is deserved. Among many things, this deficit leads to the cultural consequence of “celebrity”. Since having attention is hard to separate from deserving attention, simply having the camera pointing at you implicitly confers upon you some of the power and credentials of authority. This is why we find ourselves in the situation where Hollywood entertainers and professional athletes are empowered to steward good opinion far beyond their actual expertise." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=As%20a%20society,their%20actual%20expertise.)

> "In a broadcast world, merely being “on camera” is to be credentialed. Regardless of your actual capabilities, insight, or character, if you can somehow manage to get on camera you are granted actual audience *and* social authority (Kim Kardashian)." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=In%20a%20broadcast%20world%2C%20merely%20being%20%E2%80%9Con%20camera%E2%80%9D%20is%20to%20be%20credentialed.%20Regardless%20of%20your%20actual%20capabilities%2C%20insight%2C%20or%20character%2C%20if%20you%20can%20somehow%20manage%20to%20get%20on%20camera%20you%20are%20granted%20actual%20audience%20*and*%20social%20authority%20(Kim%20Kardashian).)

Take the special things that we’ve discovered in our lives and help them get the attention they deserve. That’s why word-of-mouth works and is so threatening.
