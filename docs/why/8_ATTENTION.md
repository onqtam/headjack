The importance of attention cannot be overstated

> "Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system." - [Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#:~:text=Attention%20is%20the%20flexible%20control%20of%20limited%20computational%20resources.%20Why%20those%20resources%20are%20limited%20and%20how%20they%20can%20best%20be%20controlled%20will%20vary%20across%20use%20cases%2C%20but%20the%20ability%20to%20dynamically%20alter%20and%20route%20the%20flow%20of%20information%20has%20clear%20benefits%20for%20the%20adaptiveness%20of%20any%20system.)

Attention has a cost - an opportunity cost. It is a resource and hence we "pay" attention
It also takes energy to process information and energy is just a resource as well


awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.
The phantom limb sensation is when the model is still operating according to the past - but the limb no longer exists. We still register the physical limb as present.

Humanity lacks a cohesive subjective awareness as a schematic model of itself - we lack an attention schema. We can't:
- control our attention
- model the attention of others and different groups of people

> "The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’" - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20theory%20begins,the%20%E2%80%98body%20schema.%E2%80%99)

> "The heart of the attention schema theory is that there is an adaptive value for a brain to build the construct of awareness: it serves as a model of attention." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20heart%20of%20the%20attention%20schema%20theory%20is%20that%20there%20is%20an%20adaptive%20value%20for%20a%20brain%20to%20build%20the%20construct%20of%20awareness%3A%20it%20serves%20as%20a%20model%20of%20attention.)

> "The attention schema theory accounts in a natural way for one of the most puzzling and mysterious aspects of awareness, the fact that we can become aware of both external and internal events." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=the%20attention%20schema%20theory%20accounts%20in%20a%20natural%20way%20for%20one%20of%20the%20most%20puzzling%20and%20mysterious%20aspects%20of%20awareness%2C%20the%20fact%20that%20we%20can%20become%20aware%20of%20both%20external%20and%20internal%20events.)

> "The ‘biased competition’ theory characterizes attention as a signal competition within the brain. Signals compete in order to be more deeply processed and ultimately to influence and guide behavior. This signal competition emerges at the earliest stages of processing in the nervous system and is present at every stage." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=the%20%E2%80%98biased%20competition,at%20every%20stage.)

> "As signals progress through the nervous system, they are increasingly subject to the influence of top–down, biasing signals. By this method, attention can be internally directed, slanting the outcome of this signal competition in a goal-directed manner based on the demands of the current task. Signals that correspond to current goals can be boosted and irrelevant signals can be suppressed." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=As%20signals%20progress,can%20be%20suppressed.)

> "The body schema appears to be a simplified, and therefore sometimes inaccurate, model of the body’s configuration. Converging evidence from both psychology and neurophysiology suggests that the brain relies on a set of relatively robust, but ultimately limited, tricks in order to compute the configuration of the body. Though these tricks tend to work well under normal circumstances, laboratory scenarios can be devised that result in the dissociation of the body schema and the actual configuration of the body." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=the%20body%20schema%20appears,configuration%20of%20the%20body.)

> "We argue that this relationship – between a real thing, the brain’s representation of that thing, and the successful control of that thing – can be fruitfully applied to understanding the relationship between attention and awareness. In this perspective, awareness is an internal model of attention useful for the control of attention." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=We%20argue%20that%20this%20relationship%20%E2%80%93%20between,useful%20for%20the%20control%20of%20attention.)

> "What you attend to, you are more likely to react to. What you do not attend to, you are very unlikely to react to. Therefore a model of attention could help in predicting one’s own behavior. For example, if you have any intuitive understanding of attention, of its dynamics and consequences for behavior, and if you are concerned about your diet, then you know not to stand all night next to the dessert tray at a party. Out of sight, out of mind – this maxim is essentially about the dynamics of attention." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=What%20you%20attend,dynamics%20of%20attention.)

> "The attention schema would not depict synapses, neurons, lateral inhibition, or electrochemical signals. The brain has no need to model its own processes in that kind of physical detail. Instead, the attention schema would depict something physically incoherent, a process without a physical manifestation – a mental possession or experience of something that empowers one to react to the item." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20attention%20schema%20would,react%20to%20the%20item.)

> "Why would the brain compute such an incomplete model of its own processes? Because that is all that is needed for the model to be useful. Just as the body schema does not need to represent the mechanistic and cellular details of the body in order to keep track of its general structure and current configuration, a detailed, complete, neuroscientific account of attention is not necessary for keeping track of the current state and general dynamics of attention." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=Why%20would%20the,dynamics%20of%20attention.)

> "Awareness is part of the control mechanism for attention. Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=awareness%20is%20part%20of%20the%20control%20mechanism,effect%20on%20behavior%20than%20it%20would%20otherwise.)

> "Things go on under the surface of consciousness. And in that condition, when you react unconsciously, you have no control over that reaction. It just pops out. How can you control it, if you’re not conscious of it? Everyone knows this to be true. It is intuitively obvious." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=Things%20go%20on%20under%20the%20surface%20of%20consciousness.%20And%20in%20that%20condition%2C%20when%20you%20react%20unconsciously%2C%20you%20have%20no%20control%20over%20that%20reaction.%20It%20just%20pops%20out.%20How%20can%20you%20control%20it%2C%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20not%20conscious%20of%20it%3F%20Everyone%20knows%20this%20to%20be%20true.%20It%20is%20intuitively%20obvious.)

The present theory provides a specific, underlying explanation for these common folk intuitions. At the root of these effects is awareness as a model of attention. Without awareness, without that model of attention, the control of attention and therefore of behavioral reaction is poor." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=It%20is%20folk,reaction%20is%20poor.)

This model leaves out many of the mechanistic details of the actual phenomenon of attention, and instead depicts a mysterious, physically impossible property – awareness.

The brain can report only the information available to it through its internal models." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full#:~:text=The%20complex%20phenomenon%20of,through%20its%20internal%20models.)

> "There's a reason legacy media fought so hard to retain control. Losing their centralized chokepoint over information is truly at the level of the fall of communism." - [Balaji Srinivasan](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1767749721156980935)

> "If we can move the center of political discourse from old media to new media, we can radically change the balance of power." - [Small Revolutions, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/small-revolutions-6c5f3288f9a9#:~:text=if%20we%20can%20move%20the%20center%20of%20political%20discourse%20from%20old%20media%20to%20new%20media%2C%20we%20can%20radically%20change%20the%20balance%20of%20power.)

> "McLuhan was right. At the end of the day, your sensemaker is a result of your experience. And both the nature and content of your experience is deeply influenced by the “architectures” that shape your capacity to experience." - [Constructing a New Narrative, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/constructing-a-new-narrative-6b717b566fc4#:~:text=McLuhan%20was%20right.%20At%20the%20end%20of%20the%20day%2C%20your%20sensemaker%20is%20a%20result%20of%20your%20experience.%20And%20both%20the%20nature%20and%20content%20of%20your%20experience%20is%20deeply%20influenced%20by%20the%20%E2%80%9Carchitectures%E2%80%9D%20that%20shape%20your%20capacity%20to%20experience.)

> "If we take ownership of the conditions of our sensemaking and take care to craft narratives and architectures that are optimized for truth rather than control, we really have no idea of what we are capable. What I feel I can say with confidence is this: through this keyhole lies our best hope for a desirable future." - [Constructing a New Narrative, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/constructing-a-new-narrative-6b717b566fc4#:~:text=if%20we%20take,a%20desirable%20future.)

> "Journalism is the function whereby society sources, orients and processes information." - [Reinvent Everything, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/reinvent-everything-556860b63308#:~:text=journalism%20is%20the%20function%20whereby%20society%20sources%2C%20orients%20and%20processes%20information.)

> "Given the primary importance and power of “True Information” to a well functioning Abundance Society, we might well expect that providing honest and thoughtful evaluation of experience will become one of the principal activities in the future." - [Reinvent Everything, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/reinvent-everything-556860b63308#:~:text=given%20the%20primary%20importance%20and%20power%20of%20%E2%80%9CTrue%20Information%E2%80%9D%20to%20a%20well%20functioning%20Abundance%20Society%2C%20we%20might%20well%20expect%20that%20providing%20honest%20and%20thoughtful%20evaluation%20of%20experience%20will%20become%20one%20of%20the%20principal%20activities%20in%20the%20future.)

> "For all of their flaws, contemporary architectures like Reddit, Yelp and to a lesser extent Wikipedia are embryonic forms of what our future “collective intelligence” architectures will look like." - [Reinvent Everything, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/reinvent-everything-556860b63308#:~:text=for%20all%20of%20their%20flaws%2C%20contemporary%20architectures%20like%20Reddit%2C%20Yelp%20and%20to%20a%20lesser%20extent%20Wikipedia%20are%20embryonic%20forms%20of%20what%20our%20future%20%E2%80%9Ccollective%20intelligence%E2%80%9D%20architectures%20will%20look%20like.)

> "We don’t have to be close to perfect to be vastly better than anything we’ve seen before." - [Reinvent Everything, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/reinvent-everything-556860b63308#:~:text=we%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20be%20close%20to%20perfect%20to%20be%20vastly%20better%20than%20anything%20we%E2%80%99ve%20seen%20before.)

> "The phrase, “The Medium is the Message” is true. A centralized, broadcast medium (e.g., television) will tend to promote certain kinds of cultural elements and inhibit others; by contrast, a decentralized medium (e.g., the Internet) will tend to present a quite different fitness landscape. Among other things, more voices will be heard and they will compete for attention in very different ways. No longer is owning the only newspaper in town a dominant enculturating position." - [The Art of Culture War, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/the-art-of-culture-war-2e4a1ccce351#:~:text=the%20phrase%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe,dominant%20enculturating%20position.)

> "What is needed most now is attention. Leviathan is good at buying lots and lots of it. We can’t. What we can do is share. We can thoughtfully and intentionally deploy our attention and energy; spending both to support authentic and caring creators. We can move from discerning consumer to champion. Take the special things that we’ve discovered in our lives and help them get the attention they deserve. That’s why word-of-mouth works and is so threatening. That’s why if you share something awesome that deserves attention you really are making a difference. And if we all do it together, we might just change the world." - [it’s simple, really …, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/swell-considerations/swell-vision-92ed397ea99f#:~:text=What%20is%20needed,change%20the%20world.)

> "Broadcast. Asymmetry. An architecture that enables a scalable division of labor for social sensemaking and decision making. No one could possibly try and understand even a small fraction of what is going on in the world. So we break the problem up into bits, hand the smaller problems up the expertise hierarchy where they are processed and reduced to simple shared “good opinion” which is then broadcast down and out to the whole population." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=Broadcast.%20Asymmetry.%20An,the%20whole%20population.)

> "One primary driver behind the collapse of the Blue Church is the swift replacement of the very mass media it is premised upon with a new symmetric kind of media — the Internet. This new media presents a niche for coherence that is very different from the one that gave rise to the Blue Church. It is a fundamentally different landscape. Like polar bears condemned to extinction by a thawing ice cap, the Blue Church’s days are numbered by the relentless erosion of broadcast mindshare to the new much more symmetrical media of the Internet." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=One%20primary%20driver,of%20the%20Internet.)

> "In the face of this ongoing acceleration, the Blue Church control structure is no longer adequate. The level of complexity of the 21st Century is simply outside of the control capacity that is possible within the form of the Blue Church. Unless we abandon the Church and move to a new approach, our race into the future will be increasingly out of control." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=In%20the%20face,out%20of%20control.)

> "We need to switch from trying to manage complex systems with complicated control structures and invent entirely new techniques for intrinsically up regulating the complex systems that make up our natural world. We don’t yet know how to do this." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5#:~:text=We%20need%20to%20switch%20from%20trying%20to%20manage%20complex%20systems%20with%20complicated%20control%20structures%20and%20invent%20entirely%20new%20techniques%20for%20intrinsically%20up%20regulating%20the%20complex%20systems%20that%20make%20up%20our%20natural%20world.%20We%20don%E2%80%99t%20yet%20know%20how%20to%20do%20this.)

> "It appears to be entirely plausible to completely replace our entire suite of sense making techniques within the decade — and in making critical progress in just a few years. This will, of course, be the consequence of a large number of different initiatives. The foundation of all of which will be “scaling trust”." - [A Kickstarter for A New Civilization, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/kickstarter-for-a-new-civilization-2f56749fd883#:~:text=It%20appears%20to,be%20%E2%80%9Cscaling%20trust%E2%80%9D.)
