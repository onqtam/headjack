> "Relevance is like biological fittedness. It is cognitive fittedness." - [John Vervaeke](https://twitter.com/tomowenmorgan/status/1742174771196866796)

> "You face a problem - in fact it's a meta problem whenever you're trying to do any problem solving - this is the following problem: the amount of information available to you is combinatorily explosive, it is vast, it is overwhelming. The amount of things you could pay attention to in this room - you could look at that spot right there, or that spot, or the relationship between the spots - you can do that, you're capable of it. When you think about it carefully now: the amount of ways you could look at this room and attend to it is combinatorially explosive. It is vast. The amount of information you have in your long-term memory and the possible combinations - it's huge. You could think of an aardvark, you could think of the Aztec empire, you could think of the beginning of the gold standard, and you could possibly even connect them all together. Think of all the ways you can connect all the things in your long-term memory. All the sequences of actions - I'm going to solve a problem - I'm going to start moving my body around, I can move this finger, then this finger could move these two, I could grab I could lift my hands, like oh I can sing - out of all the possible combinations you somehow zero in on the right thing to do, the right thing to pay attention to, and the right things to be remembering right now. You zero in on the relevant information and you ignore most - overwhelmingly most - of the irrelevant information. You frame your cognition and you pay attention only to what's within that frame and you ignore what's outside of that frame. It sounds paradoxical but this is the case - you're intelligent because of your capacity to ignore so much information." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=730)

> "Relevance realization is the name I give to a process which I argue is central to general intelligence. Your general intelligence is your capacity to solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains. For most of the problems you face the interrelated tasks of selecting what you are to pay attention to, what you are going to remember, and what you are going to do. The problem facing attention is that the amount of information available to you is astronomically vast. You have to ignore most of it, which is a lot of information. You cannot just arbitrarily guess what you should attend to nor can you methodically check all the information for that would take more time than your lifetime. There is a similar problem facing memory. Your long term memory stores a vast amount of knowledge, and the number of ways that information can be combined is astronomically vast. Similarly, all the possible sequences of actions which you could undertake is astronomically vast. Yet, moment by moment you are neither guessing nor methodically checking all the information, all your memory, or all the options for action. You are homing in on the relevant information while remembering the information relevant to your situation and selecting a relevant course of action. What is so impressive is how this is all obvious to you, and it is very often relevant to the context you are in and to the problem at hand. You can rely on the obviousness of your experience and that it is reliably sensitive to context. However, cognitive science has to explain how you generate such obviousness such that it is contextually sensitive to solving your problems. Saying that relevance is obvious or depends on context does not solve the problem because this merely renames the problem of relevance realization as the problem of generating a sense of the relevance of information in a contextually sensitive manner, and how do we do that? To say we learn it by experience is not helpful because to say we learn is to say that we zero in on relevant information in order to solve our problems. This learning cannot be arbitrary association nor can it use exhaustive examination of situations. Learning presupposes relevance realization and therefore cannot explain it. I currently have a paper under review, where my coauthors and I argue that relevance realization is probably convergent with the precision weighting at the core of predictive processing models. This convergence adds significant theoretical plausibility to the proposal that relevance realization is central to intelligence." - [John Vervaeke](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-summary-of-relevance-realization-according-to-John-Vervaeke)

> "Somehow problem solvers reliably (but not perfectly) zero in on the relevant information to be investigated. They do not do this abstractly, but in the way they formulate the problem. How individuals represent the initial state, goal state, operations, and path constraints, is the way in which they attempt to zero in on relevant information. Problem formulation is how problem solvers constrain the search space of a particular problem so that heuristics can effectively apply to it. Problem formulation captures what problem solvers deem relevant to a specific problem, and this formulation helps them to intelligently ignore most of the information in the search space. To intelligently ignore means that problem solvers do not even consider most available information, and they find and focus upon information that turns out to be relevant without comparing it to all the irrelevant information that is available." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Consider how we are beset by ill-defined problems all day long such as following and/or joining a conversation successfully, getting and/or telling a joke or telling a story. As such, we frequently have to generate problem formulations in order to both address ill-definedness and to avoid combinatorial explosion. Not only do we have to zero in on relevant information, we often have to generate missing relevant information in order to do so. Problem formulation handles both of these demands and is a primary way in which we do relevance realization within problem solving.
>
> However, sometimes the problem formulation constrains a problem in such a way so that it cannot be solved; the problem formulation itself becomes problematic. In these circumstances, the problem formulations need to be broken up and reformulated. The solver must have an insight: their relevance realization abilities have to be flexibly recursive and self-correcting. They have to realize that they have misformulated the problem and be capable of generating a new relevance profile that then informs a new, more effective formulation." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Truly the ability to determine relevance is foundational to our intelligence and would be central to any SmartData system." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "We never represent all the properties of anything because we are in the finitary predicament. We always only represent a subset of any real world things. This subset of features and how they hang together is an aspect. All representation is aspectual. Yet an aspect is a zeroing in on properties deemed relevant, and a formulation of those properties as highly relevant to each other and to oneself and others. The ability to represent crucially presupposes the ability to realize relevance and therefore cannot serve as a basis of explaining it without circularity." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "Relevance realization must be happening at a level of analysis more basic than standard information processing. Yet it cannot be handled by some central processor because that processor would face a combinatorial explosion of information facing it even within the brain’s own processing. The processing of relevance realization has to happen as a constraint on all processing both local and global within the brain. Relevance realization has to be internal, sub-semantic, sub-syntactic, and scale invariant in its operations. Finally, it must be completely self-organizing because it has to be a self-correcting and self-transforming process." - [Relevance Realization and the Neurodynamics and Neuroconnectivity of General Intelligence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299812171)

> "McKee and Barber note that it is not just any kind of insight that constitutes wisdom. Rather it is some kind of insight through illusion and into reality. Meeks and Jeste indicate that the insight involved in wisdom also has importantly to do with self‐reflection/self‐understanding. The connection here is that illusion is some form of self‐deception, so seeing through illusion and into reality involves important insight into one’s own cognition and how it might be impeding contact with reality." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "This is the heart of relevance realization: to be able to usefully ignore information in a contextually sensitive manner so as to enable our actions. Taken together, combinatorial complexity in problem solving, the largely ill-defined nature of most problems and the consideration of consequences serve to indicate the centrality of our relevance realization machinery. Thus, relevance realization is central; it involves the ability to frame our cognition and, most importantly, to do this flexibly, i.e. to be able to reframe. This ability to reframe how we find things relevant is sometimes experienced as the “aha” moment called insight." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Relevance realization is always a matter of the selective direction of attention, the appraisal of value, and the rationing and commitment of processing resources. Relevance realization is simultaneously attentional, affective, and motivational. Relevance realization largely concerns how you care about and care for information." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Evolutionary processes are constantly redefining from within evolution what it means to be fit. Relevance realization must constantly be redefining from within relevance realization what it means for information to be relevant." - [Relevance, Meaning and the Cognitive Science of Wisdom](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508333)

> "Now what we know unfortunately as true is that that intelligence - while so impressive - is only very weakly predictive of rationality. You take all the standard measures for intelligence - they all strongly predict each other - you take standard measures for rationality - this is the work of Stanovich and others - they all strongly predict each other, so two strong positive manifolds, but the measure for general intelligence and the measure for general rationality are only correlated at 0.3. Intelligence is necessary but nowhere near sufficient for rationality. Why is that? Because think about what I said: you're intelligent by ignoring most of the information. Remember my example of your interaction with the woman: sometimes the information you ignore is exactly the information you need to solve your problem. You realize that in a moment of insight, but the opposite is also constantly possible for you - you don't realize, you don't realize that you've misframed the situation - you're finding the wrong things salient you and therefore you're judging the wrong things to be relevant or important. And we live in a world that is exacerbating that - Harry Frankfurt called that bullshit and I don't mean to be offensive - that's the term of his famous essay. The liar cares about your concern for the truth and tells you something and tries to get you to believe it to be true because of your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist does something different - they try to make something salient to you and have you not care about whether it's true or false - all advertising works this way." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1390)

> "Across time, history, culture, environment - you see people coming up with sets of practices for ameliorating that self-deception and enhancing that cognitive fittedness. The name that's most usually used for those practices is wisdom. See, knowledge deals with ignorance, but wisdom deals with foolishness and those are not the same thing - you can be very intelligent and very foolish and there is no contradiction there at all." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1567)

> "We bashed out a consensus paper about what we think are the important features in wisdom. The dominant feature is perspectival metacognition. What does that mean? This is the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be able to shift perspectives. Shifting perspectives is one of the most powerful ways - I'm using my glasses like my mental frame - to get out of my mental framing. When I'm in a perspective what I typically can't see is the way the perspective is biasing me - I can't also take on interests and goals that are outside my perspective. But if I can take on his perspective or his perspective - that I can then look through them back on my perspective - I can actually overcome misframing. We depend on the dialogue between us to generate the multi-perspectival ability that can enhance the collective intelligence towards collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1621)

> "But there are ways in which the collective intelligence can be subject to self-organizing foolishness - the bullshit can overwhelm us. And are we not now in a world in which the bullshit is overwhelming us more and more and more? How can the opponent processing of democracy degenerate? Well it can break down into polarization in which the emphasis on differentiation overtakes the opponent processing, or it can break down in group think, in echo chambers and bubbles that over emphasize the integration. We lose the complexification that allows us to deal with the complexity of the world and we stupefy ourselves into a kind of collective foolishness. When you have polarization the opponent processing breaks down into adversarial processing: one side is trying to destroy at all costs the other. And the problem with this of course is that debate depends on shared orientation - if we do not have a shared normativity we can't engage in debate. Groupthink also destroys the opponent processing because it reduces the multi-perspectival nature that is needed for collective wisdom - we're all thinking from the same perspective, we all have the same orientation. So either we don't have any orientation or we all have exactly the same one and the whole machinery breaks down." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1925)

> "I've been arguing at length that the West - whatever that is supposed to point to ultimately - is suffering from a meaning crisis or another way of understanding it is a wisdom famine. I will ask my students "Where do you go for information?" - they hold up the phone. "Where do you go for knowledge?" - science, the university. "Where do you go for wisdom?" - deafening silence. deadly silence. If our democracy is not educating us towards wisdom and alleviating the meaning crisis by understanding the embodied, enacted, embedded, extended nature of our cognition - it will not survive, because the meaning crisis - the wisdom famine - will overwhelm it. Debate presupposes a common unity, a community. It presupposes distributed cognition running collective intelligence that's being educated towards the wisdom of enhancing our connectedness, our meaning in the world. Without that, what we have is degenerate adversarial processing or echo chambering that is not addressing but in fact exacerbating the meaning crisis and the wisdom famine within propositional tyranny so all we have is endemic endless ideological warfare and the tsunami of bullshit that it generates. What is needed is a way of accessing collective intelligence and transforming it into collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=2272)

we are justifying apes - we are not perfectly rational - far from it actually. We need to tame justification
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason
> "What reason does, rather, is help us justify our beliefs and actions to others, convince them through argumentation, and evaluate the justifications and arguments that others address to us. In other words, reason helps humans better exploit their uniquely rich social environment. This interactionist interpretation explains why reason may have evolved and how it fits with other cognitive mechanisms. It makes sense of strengths and weaknesses that have long puzzled philosophers and psychologists―why reason is biased in favor of what we already believe, why it may lead to terrible ideas and yet is indispensable to spreading good ones." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KRXjn7mFzN&rank=1#:~:text=What%20reason%20does,spreading%20good%20ones.)

> "Most reasons are after-the-fact rationalizations. Still, this fictional use of reasons plays a central role in human interactions, from the most trivial to the most dramatic." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9567524-it-is-based-however-on-a-convenient-fiction-most-reasons)

> "The elephant trunk is a type of nose. However impressive it may be, it would not make sense to think of it as the epitome of noses." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10799118-the-elephant-trunk-is-a-type-of-nose-however-impressive)

> "Reason is flawed, but how badly? How should success or failure in reasoning be assessed? What are the mechanisms responsible? In spite of their often bitter disagreements, parties to these polemics have failed to question a basic dogma. All have taken for granted that the job of reasoning is to help individuals achieve greater knowledge and make better decisions. If you accept the dogma, then, yes, it is quite puzzling that reason should fall short of being impartial, objective, and logical. It is paradoxical that, quite commonly, reasoning should fail to bring people to agree and, even worse, that it should often exacerbate their differences. But why accept the dogma in the first place?" - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027487-reason-is-flawed-but-how-badly-how-should-success-or)

> "Whereas reason is commonly viewed as the use of logic, or at least some system of rules to expand and improve our knowledge and our decisions, we argue that reason is much more opportunistic and eclectic and is not bound to formal norms. The main role of logic in reasoning, we suggest, may well be a rhetorical one: logic helps simplify and schematize intuitive arguments, highlighting and often exaggerating their force. So, why did reason evolve? What does it provide, over and above what is provided by more ordinary forms of inference, that could have been of special value to humans and to humans alone? To answer, we adopt a much broader perspective. Reason, we argue, has two main functions: that of producing reasons for justifying oneself, and that of producing arguments to convince others. These two functions rely on the same kinds of reasons and are closely related." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027493-whereas-reason-is-commonly-viewed-as-the-use-of-logic)


> "Sperber and Mercier see reason as an evolved module within the brain which specializes in producing reasons for our behavior. These reasons serve to justify our behavior to ourselves and others. It also enables us to evaluate the reasons proposed by others for their behavior. As such, it serves a primarily social role, one of coordination and cooperation, rather than an intellectual one of abstract problem solving... For Sperber and Mercier, what is important is that there is nothing unique about reason per-se, it simply operates on meta-level representations rather than low level primitives as most other inference mechanisms such as visual perception do.
>
> The authors propose that reason leads us astray in the pursuit of objective knowledge not because it is flawed, but because that is simply not what it evolved to do in the first place... Rather than reflecting some sort of transcendent capacity for pure abstract logic, human reason is often messy, and relies more on context and perceived relevance rather than stone-cold rules of logical deduction. Chief among these is the so-called myside bias (a generalization of confirmation bias), where humans produce reasons which reinforce their previously held beliefs. The myside bias ironically often leads people to become more wrong after thinking deeply about a problem than if they had to make a decision on the spur of the moment.
>
> ... If the hypothesis put forward by Sperber and Mercier is correct though, human reason isn’t even for problem solving, let alone for some hypothetical context-agnostic problem solving. Rather, it is for justification and explanation of behavior and decisions reached implicitly within an embodied social context. In this view, the so-called flaws in human reasoning which a superhuman intelligence would supposedly correct for are not even flaws, but rather the features of the mechanism working as they evolved to...
>
> All hope is not lost however, as the authors do discuss the conditions within which reason does in fact aid in the obtaining of objective truth or knowledge, and those are primarily social. For Sperber and Mercier, it is when reason is placed within its proper context, and humans are forced to justify and explain themselves to others, that reason does more than simply serve a social function. This is because critically, humans are better at evaluating reasons than we are at producing them. As a result, the bias towards producing reasons which justify our implicit decisions and the ability of others to find flaws in our reasons end up working together. These two abilities make possible open argumentation and debate to produce reasons which are better tuned to reality, and can thus ultimately drive better problem solving in the future." - [Thoughts on “The Enigma of Reason”, by Arthur Juliani](https://awjuliani.medium.com/thoughts-on-the-enigma-of-reason-11983c90cb75)

> "UTOK's [Justification Systems Theory](https://www.unifiedtheoryofknowledge.org/8-key-ideas/justification-systems-theory) posits that there was an important tipping point in human evolution when our ancestors started talking in sentences. Sentences, in the form of propositions, carry meanings that can be questioned. This “question-answer dynamic” reinforces the process by which humans form networks of beliefs and values. UTOK calls these networks “justification systems” because they link together to develop a coordinated sense among people of what is and what ought to be the case. As such, they provide the structure for legitimizing how people think about the world and how they should behave." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=UTOK%27s%20Justification%20Systems,they%20should%20behave.)

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
