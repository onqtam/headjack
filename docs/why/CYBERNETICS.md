> "When something is both highly integrated and highly differentiated it can do many different things without falling apart. So complexification enhances agency - it gives you your emergent abilities." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1250)

> "An agent is any being that can detect the consequences of it's behavior and modify that behavior in order to achieve it's goals. Another way of putting it is that an agent is a problem solver. Intelligence is the capacity to be a general problem solver - you can solve a wide variety of problems in a wide variety of domains." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=670)

> "The very processes that make you adaptive make you subject to self-deception, so wisdom, meaning the overcoming of self-deception, is not optional." - [John Vervaeke](https://twitter.com/tomowenmorgan/status/1742174765463298489)

> "Now what we know unfortunately as true is that that intelligence - while so impressive - is only very weakly predictive of rationality. You take all the standard measures for intelligence - they all strongly predict each other - you take standard measures for rationality - this is the work of Stanovich and others - they all strongly predict each other, so two strong positive manifolds, but the measure for general intelligence and the measure for general rationality are only correlated at 0.3. Intelligence is necessary but nowhere near sufficient for rationality. Why is that? Because think about what I said: you're intelligent by ignoring most of the information. Remember my example of your interaction with the woman: sometimes the information you ignore is exactly the information you need to solve your problem. You realize that in a moment of insight, but the opposite is also constantly possible for you - you don't realize, you don't realize that you've misframed the situation - you're finding the wrong things salient you and therefore you're judging the wrong things to be relevant or important. And we live in a world that is exacerbating that - Harry Frankfurt called that bullshit and I don't mean to be offensive - that's the term of his famous essay. The liar cares about your concern for the truth and tells you something and tries to get you to believe it to be true because of your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist does something different - they try to make something salient to you and have you not care about whether it's true or false - all advertising works this way." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1390)

> "Across time, history, culture, environment - you see people coming up with sets of practices for ameliorating that self-deception and enhancing that cognitive fittedness. The name that's most usually used for those practices is wisdom. See, knowledge deals with ignorance, but wisdom deals with foolishness and those are not the same thing - you can be very intelligent and very foolish and there is no contradiction there at all." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1567)

> "We bashed out a consensus paper about what we think are the important features in wisdom. The dominant feature is perspectival metacognition. What does that mean? This is the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be able to shift perspectives. Shifting perspectives is one of the most powerful ways - I'm using my glasses like my mental frame - to get out of my mental framing. When I'm in a perspective what I typically can't see is the way the perspective is biasing me - I can't also take on interests and goals that are outside my perspective. But if I can take on his perspective or his perspective - that I can then look through them back on my perspective - I can actually overcome misframing. We depend on the dialogue between us to generate the multi-perspectival ability that can enhance the collective intelligence towards collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1621)

> "You can see the myths as enacting relevance realization on the collective intelligence of distributed cognition trying to educate us into wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1866)

> "I'm proposing to you that we should understand democracy as opponent processing within the collective intelligence of distributed cognition that is trying to self-organize that collective intelligence into a more proper orientation to the World." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1900)

> "But there are ways in which the collective intelligence can be subject to self-organizing foolishness - the bullshit can overwhelm us. And are we not now in a world in which the bullshit is overwhelming us more and more and more? How can the opponent processing of democracy degenerate? Well it can break down into polarization in which the emphasis on differentiation overtakes the opponent processing, or it can break down in group think, in echo chambers and bubbles that over emphasize the integration. We lose the complexification that allows us to deal with the complexity of the world and we stupefy ourselves into a kind of collective foolishness. When you have polarization the opponent processing breaks down into adversarial processing: one side is trying to destroy at all costs the other. And the problem with this of course is that debate depends on shared orientation - if we do not have a shared normativity we can't engage in debate. Groupthink also destroys the opponent processing because it reduces the multi-perspectival nature that is needed for collective wisdom - we're all thinking from the same perspective, we all have the same orientation. So either we don't have any orientation or we all have exactly the same one and the whole machinery breaks down." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1925)

> "I've been arguing at length that the West - whatever that is supposed to point to ultimately - is suffering from a meaning crisis or another way of understanding it is a wisdom famine. I will ask my students "Where do you go for information?" - they hold up the phone. "Where do you go for knowledge?" - science, the university. "Where do you go for wisdom?" - deafening silence. deadly silence. If our democracy is not educating us towards wisdom and alleviating the meaning crisis by understanding the embodied, enacted, embedded, extended nature of our cognition - it will not survive, because the meaning crisis - the wisdom famine - will overwhelm it. Debate presupposes a common unity, a community. It presupposes distributed cognition running collective intelligence that's being educated towards the wisdom of enhancing our connectedness, our meaning in the world. Without that, what we have is degenerate adversarial processing or echo chambering that is not addressing but in fact exacerbating the meaning crisis and the wisdom famine within propositional tyranny so all we have is endemic endless ideological warfare and the tsunami of bullshit that it generates. What is needed is a way of accessing collective intelligence and transforming it into collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=2272)

we are justifying apes - we are not perfectly rational - far from it actually. We need to tame justification
https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason
> "What reason does, rather, is help us justify our beliefs and actions to others, convince them through argumentation, and evaluate the justifications and arguments that others address to us. In other words, reason helps humans better exploit their uniquely rich social environment. This interactionist interpretation explains why reason may have evolved and how it fits with other cognitive mechanisms. It makes sense of strengths and weaknesses that have long puzzled philosophers and psychologists―why reason is biased in favor of what we already believe, why it may lead to terrible ideas and yet is indispensable to spreading good ones." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KRXjn7mFzN&rank=1#:~:text=What%20reason%20does,spreading%20good%20ones.)

> "Most reasons are after-the-fact rationalizations. Still, this fictional use of reasons plays a central role in human interactions, from the most trivial to the most dramatic." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9567524-it-is-based-however-on-a-convenient-fiction-most-reasons)

> "The elephant trunk is a type of nose. However impressive it may be, it would not make sense to think of it as the epitome of noses." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10799118-the-elephant-trunk-is-a-type-of-nose-however-impressive)

> "Reason is flawed, but how badly? How should success or failure in reasoning be assessed? What are the mechanisms responsible? In spite of their often bitter disagreements, parties to these polemics have failed to question a basic dogma. All have taken for granted that the job of reasoning is to help individuals achieve greater knowledge and make better decisions. If you accept the dogma, then, yes, it is quite puzzling that reason should fall short of being impartial, objective, and logical. It is paradoxical that, quite commonly, reasoning should fail to bring people to agree and, even worse, that it should often exacerbate their differences. But why accept the dogma in the first place?" - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027487-reason-is-flawed-but-how-badly-how-should-success-or)

> "Whereas reason is commonly viewed as the use of logic, or at least some system of rules to expand and improve our knowledge and our decisions, we argue that reason is much more opportunistic and eclectic and is not bound to formal norms. The main role of logic in reasoning, we suggest, may well be a rhetorical one: logic helps simplify and schematize intuitive arguments, highlighting and often exaggerating their force. So, why did reason evolve? What does it provide, over and above what is provided by more ordinary forms of inference, that could have been of special value to humans and to humans alone? To answer, we adopt a much broader perspective. Reason, we argue, has two main functions: that of producing reasons for justifying oneself, and that of producing arguments to convince others. These two functions rely on the same kinds of reasons and are closely related." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027493-whereas-reason-is-commonly-viewed-as-the-use-of-logic)


> "Sperber and Mercier see reason as an evolved module within the brain which specializes in producing reasons for our behavior. These reasons serve to justify our behavior to ourselves and others. It also enables us to evaluate the reasons proposed by others for their behavior. As such, it serves a primarily social role, one of coordination and cooperation, rather than an intellectual one of abstract problem solving... For Sperber and Mercier, what is important is that there is nothing unique about reason per-se, it simply operates on meta-level representations rather than low level primitives as most other inference mechanisms such as visual perception do.
>
> The authors propose that reason leads us astray in the pursuit of objective knowledge not because it is flawed, but because that is simply not what it evolved to do in the first place... Rather than reflecting some sort of transcendent capacity for pure abstract logic, human reason is often messy, and relies more on context and perceived relevance rather than stone-cold rules of logical deduction. Chief among these is the so-called myside bias (a generalization of confirmation bias), where humans produce reasons which reinforce their previously held beliefs. The myside bias ironically often leads people to become more wrong after thinking deeply about a problem than if they had to make a decision on the spur of the moment.
>
> ... If the hypothesis put forward by Sperber and Mercier is correct though, human reason isn’t even for problem solving, let alone for some hypothetical context-agnostic problem solving. Rather, it is for justification and explanation of behavior and decisions reached implicitly within an embodied social context. In this view, the so-called flaws in human reasoning which a superhuman intelligence would supposedly correct for are not even flaws, but rather the features of the mechanism working as they evolved to...
>
> All hope is not lost however, as the authors do discuss the conditions within which reason does in fact aid in the obtaining of objective truth or knowledge, and those are primarily social. For Sperber and Mercier, it is when reason is placed within its proper context, and humans are forced to justify and explain themselves to others, that reason does more than simply serve a social function. This is because critically, humans are better at evaluating reasons than we are at producing them. As a result, the bias towards producing reasons which justify our implicit decisions and the ability of others to find flaws in our reasons end up working together. These two abilities make possible open argumentation and debate to produce reasons which are better tuned to reality, and can thus ultimately drive better problem solving in the future." - [Thoughts on “The Enigma of Reason”, by Arthur Juliani](https://awjuliani.medium.com/thoughts-on-the-enigma-of-reason-11983c90cb75)

> "UTOK's [Justification Systems Theory](https://www.unifiedtheoryofknowledge.org/8-key-ideas/justification-systems-theory) posits that there was an important tipping point in human evolution when our ancestors started talking in sentences. Sentences, in the form of propositions, carry meanings that can be questioned. This “question-answer dynamic” reinforces the process by which humans form networks of beliefs and values. UTOK calls these networks “justification systems” because they link together to develop a coordinated sense among people of what is and what ought to be the case. As such, they provide the structure for legitimizing how people think about the world and how they should behave." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=UTOK%27s%20Justification%20Systems,they%20should%20behave.)

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.

> ...It serves as a central information exchange, rather than a locus of cognition itself, enabling different specialized brain networks to interact and supporting integrated and adaptive responses." - [Global workspace theory, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory#:~:text=GWT%20analogizes%20the,and%20adaptive%20responses.)
