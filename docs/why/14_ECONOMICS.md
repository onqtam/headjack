"Why isn't economics an evolutionary science?" by Thorstein Veblen 1 century ago
"why not also a thermodynamic, information-theoretic science? A system of free-energy minimization within constraints"

the genius of markets is not necessarily in its efficiency and allocation, but in creating an evolutionary competition for solving human problems

business is about solving human problems, the role of the state is to create the conditions for large-scale cooperation to allow that process to happen. That means:
- promoting inclusion - no large-scale cooperation if excluding large groups of people
- need fair social contract
- institutions that build trust: rule of law, money, regulation
- also need the state to solve collective action problems to grease the wheels of cooperation

In a democratic system people have a right - even a duty - to define the fitness function that the market system is evolving towards.
Social equity, climate change & others are valid social concerns that should be reflected in that market fitness function.

We should worry more about creating a healthy ecology that promotes real tangible improvements in people's lives and less worrying about theoretical trade-offs and efficiency...?
Instead of thinking of markets and states as competitors - think of them as a joint system.
This ecology has lots of different forms of organization, not just markets and states, but a broader zoo of forms.

Dominant ideology: pursuing self-interest is good.
One of the most dangerous ideas in economics: Methodological individualism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism
This led to Margaret Thatcher's quote "there's no such thing as society" which leads to one no longer believing that society can act together to handle climate change or other technological challenges.
At the root of this is a confusion between collectivism, which the neoliberals critiqued, quite rightly, versus solving collective-action problems.
One of the big successes of the Enlightenment was the emphasis on individual freedom, individual rights & so on, a huge jump for mankind. But then, taking that to an extreme, we lose sight of our ability to work together to solve collective-action problems.
We have to rediscover ways to create an ideology and system of thought that allows us to tackle existential problems together.

^^ many of the above points have been taken from santa fe economics simposium - have only a screenshot from my phone of the text on my kindle - can't properly attribute now to who said it

M. O. Jackson on our ignorance of what the state does... Part of the problem is ignorance. It's easy to be ignorant of all the things the state does. What if we had an accurate and real-time representation of the budget that we could inspect and try to allocate differently and reason through that - on a national/state/local level and so forth? People need an impression how much goes into each part like roads, K-12 education, etc. You need to see the numbers in order to also see the tradeoffs. People are ignorant of the scope and size of the state. Removing this ignorance is a good step towards more trust & understanding.

E. D. Beinhocker: One big thing that Hayek got right was, in complex social systems predicting the future is a dangerous business. Popper's answer to that challenge was what he called "piecemeal social engineering", so he was very much against Utopianism and kind of big grand plans. But he saw that in the historical records... that you make reforms one step at a time. You sort of march your way forward and you try stuff and not everything works but some stuff does work and you do more of what works and less of what doesn't. That's an evolutionary process. And evolution can grope its way toward whatever goals exist in a complex system. One could argue the three great inventions of the Enlightenment - taking into account the blind spots - were three evolutionary systems: science, which is an evolutionary epistemological system; democracy, which is a kind of evolutionary political system; and markets, which are an evolutionary economic system. But... in recent decades we've had an ideology that has said the only fitness function that matters is the maximization of self-interest and a narrow definition of profits and so on. So, we've had a system that has been adapting to that and giving us the results that we have today. One of the key ways to handle these big challenges is to reinvigorate these evolutionary processes in our society and get them pointed at solving our biggest societal challenges.


> "With 35-45% of U.S. GDP spent by the government, and perhaps another 10% spent by nonprofits, it is possible that a majority of U.S. GDP is spent outside of the market, without regard to market signals or forces. It is perhaps time to rethink what we call this economic system. The web of financial flows making up our society is not one that is greatly defined by the spending of individual billionaires. It is rather less of an intricate, flexible, organic web, and more of a rigid grid taking its shape from various large bureaucratic organizations." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781279198929182)




> "If billionaires are unduly influential by virtue of spending lots of money, then by the same metric the influence of bureaucracies or universities is a behemoth tidal wave. The Pentagon alone spends 4 Elon Musks each year. Billionaire spending is a few drops in the bucket. The U.S. government spends more on kidney dialysis in Medicare ($28B) than it allots to NASA ($25B). More federal money is spent each year on soda and sweetened drinks (~$10.5B) than Elon Musk could spend if he wanted to spend his whole fortune to the last penny before he died." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781219727917485)



> "Healthy life grows and becomes looked upon with envy. This is, after all, the only meaning of market capitalization: how much do others want what you have built? But we mustn’t confuse this financial growth for purpose. The purpose of your empire is some higher task that you have built it to accomplish. Its nature is not its market capitalization and financial flows, but the whole system of machinery that gives it a very particular strategic position and animates it towards that particular task. Financial growth is simply one operational constraint among many towards the accomplishment of its visionary ends. Ironically, it is these focused strategic empires that display the best financial performance. But don’t let the venture capitalists confuse you: that is not what is important about them." - [Quit Your Job, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/)



> "When people talk about a “market economy”, what exactly does that mean? You might assume it means a society where all or most economic decisions are made through markets. But this does not describe our own economy, or anything else that gets called a “market economy”. Most economic decisions are made inside particular organizations, which make their internal decisions according to hierarchical structures and individual judgment, taking markets into account as one factor among many. If two workers both want to avoid a Monday morning shift, or two department heads are arguing over hiring policy, or two engineers are debating which design to adopt, no one expects the people involved to start setting prices and bidding against each other like they would in a market. And yet markets are nevertheless crucial to our economic organization, in ways that are notably different from non-“market economies”. How, then, does the market fit in?
>
> What markets make possible is smooth interaction between independent units. Organizations have hierarchical control over their own assets, including very complex social processes like medical schools or aircraft control towers, but they also need to coordinate with other parts of society external to the organization itself, like customers and suppliers. Markets make this easy and reliable. The market is a thin layer of crucial but simple social technology that lets an organization ignore the deep complexity of the people and organizations it interacts with. This is helpful because the market interface an organization presents to the outside world is so much simpler than the non-market-based coordination it uses internally.
>
> In a way, the market is like the docking module between the Apollo and Soyuz rockets. It’s a crucial component, and without it the entire system couldn’t possibly function as a unified whole, but it’s still a relatively small fraction of the system’s mass and complexity. Understanding how it works won’t tell you all that much about how the Soyuz itself works." - [Markets Are Thin, by Ben Landau-Taylor](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/markets-are-thin#:~:text=When%20people%20talk,Soyuz%20itself%20works.)

> "The most pragmatic problem is the future of this planet, and its survival. And I think one of the great disgraces of academic economists is that they're not at the forefront of this. It's morally reprehensible that they're not leading the way." - [Geoffrey West](https://twitter.com/sfiscience/status/1193262457566842881)

They're so hi-tech that they can take in a protein, disassemble it, build a new protein (perhaps an entirely different kind) and issue the new protein. That's as if we could stick trees into a chipper machine and get a live tree out the other side. Very hi-tech! We're not nearly as hi-tech yet, as our own internal microworld.
>
> We have a great deal to learn from nature. Take economics. If we ran our bodies' economy the way our economy is run it might look something like this. We could call the heart-lung system the “northern industrial organs”. You give them ownership of the bones in which you mine the raw material blood cells that arise in the marrow. Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today. You can see that a living system can't function that way." - [After Darwin, by Elisabet Sahtouris](https://ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/AfterDarwin.html#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20hundred,can%27t%20function%20that%20way.)

You would rot away in a month, if every organ of your body, were out for itself." - [Jacque Fresco](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/728466)

> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account." - [Friedrich A.

> "As the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decisionmaking and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the “homo economicus” with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a “homo socialis” with other-regarding preferences. While the “homo economicus” optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the “homo socialis” are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. Notably, the “homo socialis” manages to earn higher payoffs than the “homo economicus”.

> I show that the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the “homo economicus” (“economics 1.0”), a complementary theory must be developed for the “homo socialis”. This economic theory might be called “economics 2.0” or “socionomics”. The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as “participatory market society”.

We need to crowdsource the quantification of how much anything costs

Here’s what the operating system for humanity should enable: state a problem and incentivize someone to solve it. Recursively/iteratively and in parallel - pointing to problems, ranking them, and rewarding for them being solved

We need to move from a money-on-money-return world to a transparency-on-transparency-return world

Capitalism is suffering from opacity

The metaverse is a parallel economy
Parallel media, economy & governance

Laissez-faire capitalism needs to end
We're in a free for all and that should scare everybody

The invisible hand has no competition - it’s left unchecked and is ripping meaning and morals out of our civilization. If you truly care about competition we should introduce it at the most fundamental level and give rise to another invisible hand that’s not fungible to material possessions but is all about the meaning of life and recognition by and connection to others.
We need a meta-invisible hand that will tune the relationship and distribution of money (claims over resources) and human values


An open-source economy

the biggest harms in the world come from opaqueness on the enterprise level

We have to incentivise contribution to the common good and we have to decouple that from resources - we need a new incentive

The completely open global do-it-all company

A publicly run parallel socioeconomic system embedded within the current one - parasitizing it from within

We need to make a single coherent company for everyone for everything - we need to reduce the costs of cooperation and define the protocols for status and redistribution

The most meta-economic thing to do is to incentivize the truth bubble up

The most important thing to compute is the most optimal way to cooperate and coordinate.

# SECTION: Redirecting surplus
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "From surplus above subsistence, we get the whole mass of profits, savings, investment, and consumption of luxury commodities. In capitalism, ownership of this surplus, much of which is spent on luxury, has been used as an incentive to increase production and boost growth; it is what encourages investors to invest, savers to save, and landlords to rent. The disproportionate power of billionaires and the effort of those who aspire to such levels of wealth is this incentive in action. But like all things in economics, this incentive is a tradeoff. There are costs to this luxurious incentive mechanism: the production costs of the luxury goods themselves, the free time afforded to those who have secured the means of their substance without labor, the redundancies of production demanded by market competition and consumer choice, the power and talent directed into the zero-sum games in the financial industry which must manage this accumulated wealth, and the speculative bubbles which naturally result from such accumulation." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "Our popular orthodoxies around economics have made us forget the distinction between needs and wants... All luxury, and all property, is premised on the existence of society reproducing itself. If we choose to value things which are in fact luxuries over those things which are in fact necessities, we may find ourselves having neither. Those moments where social reproduction totally breaks down are the object of fear for civilization itself: plagues, wars, famines, and general economic and political collapse." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "It’s often been declared that the USSR fell because it failed to innovate, or that the planning system couldn’t adequately allocate capital and resources without price signals. But this explanation is more drawn from the theoretical logic of markets than on studying the actual history of the country. In reality, the USSR had one of the best-educated populations in the world, and scientists who produced many cutting-edge advancements. But there is an important distinction between scientific innovation and innovation in the production process. That distinction makes it clear why a tradeoff exists, and just why incentive systems matter.
>
> While Soviet scientists did innovate in technology, there was no incentive to implement innovations in the production process. Enterprises would reject using the latest, most efficient machines because doing so would mean fewer resources allocated to the enterprise, which would mean less power and wealth for the managers and bureaucrats in charge of it—not to mention, for those they could bribe. More efficiency meant that an enterprise could make do with less, and therefore the planners would ratchet back those resources. This led to systemic hoarding.
>
> Soviet planners, while always in a battle with enterprises for accurate statistics, were generally good at allocating capital and labor to high productivity sectors of the economy. This was how the USSR was able to achieve such high growth up until its stagnation in the 70s. But after the easy gains of industrialization were won, the tendency against changes to the plan won out. The more changes that were proposed, the more computational adjustments would be required, and the more mistakes became possible. This is where focusing on necessity alone can go awry.
>
> The economic plan could secure the necessities of social reproduction, but the incentives to use surplus production for growth existed on paper only. The flaw in the Soviet system was that the mere existence of surplus does not necessarily imply growth. A society can maintain the same level of surplus by simply consuming or squandering all surplus beyond what is required to replace existing capital stocks. This is what happened in the USSR but in a very unusual way. The planners were well aware of the need to implement new innovations to grow, and allocated some 25-35% of GDP towards investment (the all-time U.S. high in the postwar period is roughly 20%). But because much of this investment was not utilized, it was merely consuming surplus. Hence, the stagnation of the late USSR.
>
> But take careful note: social reproduction as such did not break down until there was an attempt to transition towards more liberal, market-based institutions. The severe depression was not directly caused by the failures of Soviet economic planning, but by the breakdown of social institutions and the systemic theft of formerly state-owned enterprises by Russia’s rising oligarchs. It was only when the planning system was replaced by an incentive system that demanded a much higher level of immediate luxury for the oligarchs that society could no longer hold together. An economic system that lacks growth may be maladapted for great power competition and economic development, but one which ignores the requirements for social reproduction will fail spectacularly in both the short and long term." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "We live in a world characterized by big numbers and non-linear systems. Don’t let civilization and all its technological and moral trappings fool you; the threats presented by our own growth are just as existential as those faced by our ancestors. We have never been above nature; we will never escape our war with her." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "Much can be imagined, given the will to see surplus as something to be allocated strategically, and see beyond luxury as the sole motivation for production. This new kind of austerity regime would make certain goods more expensive in the short-term as well as put downward pressure on profits. That is the price we would have to pay. Economics is about trade-offs, after all. But it also comes with its own luxuries for normal people, those who are essential for the reproduction of our society. Job security, healthcare, and education, which have increasingly become essentials for reproduction of our society, could cease to be treated as privileges. But such a program would require the development of a state consciousness among the powerful quasi-governing segments of American society that currently conceive of themselves as private actors without public duty. Without a change in consciousness, to see that their interests are intimately tied to the public interest, they may find themselves more comfortable with the continued decline of American civilization. To those concerned with its preservation, among the elite and in the general population, there can be nothing more misguided than the clutching at private wants against public needs with such pathological drive." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

(Hobbes 1998: 23)

John Locke (1678) The principal spring from which the actions of men take their rise, the

> "The three ruling passions in human life are often said to be the desire for property, the desire for power, and the desire for prestige or status or esteem. The eVects of the Wrst desire are charted in standard economics, the eVects of the second in political science—and of course in the annals of history. But the eVects of the desire for esteem have escaped the sustained attention of social scientists. It is almost as if there were a conspiracy not to register or document the fact that we are, and always have been, an honour-hungry species." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "What economics and politics reveal in the domain of property and power is that the unintended consequences of people’s desires congeal into aggregate patterns that affect in turn what individuals can and choose to do. The competition for property dictates the prices at which individual goods can be obtained, for example, while the competition for power dictates the opportunities for individuals to find a place among others and to exercise influence. Both disciplines, however, have a normative as well as a positive or empirical side. They not only seek to reveal how things actually turn out as a result of people’s interactions, but also try to identify ways in which they might be made to turn out better. Thus economics specialises in identifying more efficient systems of production and distribution, politics in charting more stable ways of organising the dispensation whereby power is allocated among individuals and groups. And specialists in each discipline equally argue for improvements that would have beneficial consequences, not just for endogenous ideals like efficiency and stability, but also for ideals—perhaps more controversial ideals—like freedom, community, and equality.
>
> We see no reason why there shouldn’t be a study that serves these same positive and normative ends in regard to the system generated by people’s desire for esteem. Were it distinct enough to earn a Greek name on a par with ‘economics’ and ‘politics’, we might call it ‘kudonomics’: the study of the laws governing the system of kudos or renown... There is an economy in property, an economy in power, and there is also, so we believe, an economy in esteem." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Economies are systems whereby scarce resources are allocated among competing parties. In particular, they are systems of allocation that have an interactive or aggregative dimension. What individual agents do gives rise to aggregate patterns that feed back in turn into the things that determine what individual agents do; they feed back, for example, into the determination of people’s opportunities and expectations. This more or less standard account of an economy is completely general, abstracting from the sorts of resources that are allocated...
>
> Our aim in this book is to look at the scope for studying, in the manner of an economics, the system whereby perhaps the most important resource of this attitudinal kind—esteem—is allocated among individuals...
>
> Esteem cannot be given away or traded in the ordinary manner, for there is no way that I can buy the good opinion of another or sell to others my good opinion of them... But though it is non-tradable in that sense, esteem is still a good that is allocated in society according to more or less systematic determinants; and it is a good whose allocation has an interactive, aggregative aspect. Thus there is room, at least on the face of it, for studying both the positive results of that emerging pattern and the normative prospects for changing that pattern in a way that is generally beneficial." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Some economists will say that esteem is taken into account in standard theory to the extent that reputation—say, the reputation for delivering on time or for delivering at a certain level of quality—is seen as an important resource for someone in the market. But reputation is distinct from esteem in our sense. Esteem may accrue to someone who is not reidentifiable—someone who lacks a recognisable name or face—whereas reputation presupposes reidentifiability. And the two notions come apart even where reidentifiability is assumed...
>
> The tendency among economists who discuss the value of reputation is to see it as deriving entirely from the value of the commodities it enables an agent to secure. Like money, esteem is taken to give an agent a certain purchasing power in the domain of consumption goods—an expectation of being able to use it to obtain such goods—and that is assumed to be the reason it is attractive. We do not think that this reductionist view of market reputation carries over to esteem more generally. We seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among people we are very unlikely to meet again; we even seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among those who will live after our time and whom we will never meet. It is hard to see how this could make sense if esteem had no value for us other than as a means of securing consumption goods." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "The economics of any system of allocation tries not just to understand the system, as mentioned, but also to see how far it can be made to work better and to work for the better promotion of what is regarded as the common good. It constitutes a normative as well as a positive economics. And there is enormous scope, it turns out, for exploring the normative potential of the economy of esteem.
>
> It is common nowadays to think that there are only two reliable controls available for ensuring that people will act in a manner that conduces to the common good: the one is the invisible hand of the market, the other the iron hand of law and administration—the iron hand of the state... Governments have tried to market more and more of the services that used to be provided in the non-marketed sector of the economy—services in education, research, health, counselling, and the like. And, where marketing is impossible or problematic, they have sought to impose a tougher regime of monitoring and management: they have tried to subject those providing the services to ever more intrusive forms of surveillance and accounting.
>
> We think that this dichotomous picture of regulatory possibilities is misconceived. In particular, we think that it overlooks the possibility of subjecting people to a quite different sort of discipline: that involved in being required to act so as to secure esteem and escape disesteem. We think of this discipline as an intangible hand that complements the invisible and iron hands that have monopolised the attention of regulators. The forces of esteem are distinctively associated, not with the market, and not with the state, but with what is nowadays often described as civil society. One of the most interesting projects in institutional design is to investigate the conditions under which the intangible hand can be expected to work well and, in particular, to work for the production of what is generally seen as the common good.
>
> The distinction between the iron hand, the invisible hand, and the intangible hand is analytically well grounded. The iron hand involves actions that intentionally sanction agents—reward or punish them—so that they behave in a certain way; it is represented, for example, in the legal and regulatory initiatives of the state. The invisible hand also involves actions that serve to sanction agents—for example, the actions of consumers in seeking out the cheapest provider of a certain good—but those actions are not designed intentionally to elicit a certain pattern of behaviour, such as competitive pricing; they serve as rewards and penalties that elicit that pattern but they are not necessarily intended by their agents in that role. The intangible hand is like the invisible hand, and unlike the iron hand, in deploying non-intentional sanctions of this kind. But it is unlike the invisible hand, in that the sanctions deployed involve the formation of attitudes—rewards of esteem, penalties of disesteem—not, or at least not necessarily, the performance of actions." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Adam Smith, the founder of economics, was himself a great believer in the attraction that people feel for esteem, and the repulsion that they feel for disesteem. ‘Nature, when she formed man for society’, he wrote, ‘endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original aversion to offend his brethren. She taught him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regard’. In adopting this view, Smith was following a tradition of emphasis on the importance of the esteem motive that had been present in Western thought in the time of the Greeks and the Romans, had resurfaced with emphasis in the Renaissance, and had become a major theme in the moral and social treatises of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries...
>
> The belief in the power of esteem led Smith even to argue that the reason why we seek out wealth, the reason why we want to have more and more to spend on what he called baubles and trinkets, is that by achieving conspicuousness in such possessions, we win distinction and esteem. ‘It is the vanity, not the ease or the pleasure, which interests us’. Writing in 1790, John Adams gave nice expression to the same idea. ‘Riches force the opinion on a man that he is the object of the congratulations of others; and he feels that they attract the complaisance of the public.’
>
> But this view that it is an interest in esteem that fuels the desire for material goods and services largely disappeared with the development of mainstream economics...
>
> We can think of three main reasons why esteem may have slipped out of focus among economists and social scientists in the two centuries since Smith wrote his path-breaking books. One is that with the advent of economics, in particular with the discovery of invisible-hand possibilities of social ordering, it became unfashionable to give attention to any mode of social discipline that invoked virtue in some way. Bernard Mandeville, in his Fable of the Bees, was very influential in preaching that private vice was public virtue and, albeit Smith wanted to distance himself from Mandevillean irony, the invisible hand gave a certain substance to that rather paradoxical lesson. The centrepiece example of the invisible hand was the open and free market in which, so it was claimed, the individual pursuit of advantage—shameless self-seeking, as it appeared to many—would guarantee that goods were made available, to the beneWt of all, at competitive prices.
>
> ... Esteem and virtue go closely together. Thus in letting go of individual virtue as a source of collective order, economists and social scientists may have let go at the same time of the desire for being thought to be virtuous as a source of such order." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "We believe, as Adam Smith believed, that it is nature that endows people with an attraction for esteem, not just the corrupt culture of an old-style aristocracy. We believe that even if the invisible hand is a potent force of social order, still there is a lot of force attaching also to the intangible hand." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Among the things that may be expected to move people most reliably and forcibly is the desire to be thought well of by their fellows and the aversion to being regarded badly. People, so it was generally held, live under the regime or law of opinion and that regime moulds all that they are and do. It provides a gravitational field that silently shapes their dispositions and their doings, exerting a long, insistent influence that can only be resisted at the cost of considerable effort and self-sacrifice." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In many cases... we will prefer someone to behave more virtuously, if with a greater desire for esteem, than to have them behave less virtuously but with a lesser concern to be admired." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Attitude-dependent goods of esteem may rationally be substituted by individuals for such material, action-dependent goods, as when someone foregoes a larger salary elsewhere in order to remain attached to a more estimable organisation—an organisation that may be expected to give them greater personal standing than the alternative—or when someone forgoes such esteem for a rise in salary." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Just as the economy of esteem is not insulated from the material economy or the regime of power, neither is it really a single, homogeneous system in itself. There will be many overlapping subsystems within the economy of esteem in almost any contemporary society. And almost every individual will belong to a number of those subsystems, having a stake in how he or she stands in each. The subsystems will compete with one another for the energy and time of participants. And they will often be in conflict, in the sense that a high performance in one will count against performing well in another. Teenagers at school will have a stake in how they are thought of by parents, teachers, and peers but will find, in all likelihood, that it is hard to do well simultaneously in each of those subcultures. Peers may deride them for a high standing in the other groups, for example, and may drive them into systematically underperforming on those fronts." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem incentives operate in a context where there are feedback eVects between individual action and the social context within which such action is pursued. The performance level of each individual contributes to the standards by which each performer is assessed. Accordingly, there are, as we might put it, unintended consequences in play in the economy of esteem. To appeal to the terminology of Schelling’s (1978) book, micro-motives create macro-behaviour patterns that are not simply a direct magnification of the individual case." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem eVects still play an extensive role, both in explaining the allocation of persons across activities that might be sources of esteem, and in disciplining poor performance and encouraging high performance in those domains that do not admit the possibility of exit." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "When the number of persons in a given population who comply is relatively small, there will be positive esteem associated with so acting. Then, as the number of compliers increases, the amount of esteem attached to so acting will decline and conceivably disappear. For example, when few people tell the truth, doing so will be remarkable and represent a potentially significant source of esteem. But when most people are telling the truth, truth-telling is unremarkable and its esteem utility on that account unlikely to be very high. However, this fact does not necessarily imply that, over the range where most people conform, esteem eVects disappear. For, as it becomes a matter of course that people comply, it tends to become a source of disesteem to fail to do so. Accordingly, esteem-based incentives to comply with the norm are operative with varying levels of intensity more or less over the whole range. At the same time, the level of compliance that is forthcoming will be a positive function of the amount of esteem attached. The larger the esteem reward for complying, and/or the larger the disesteem penalty for not complying, the higher the level of compliance is likely to be." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Richard McAdams (1997) offers an example of a possible bootstrap phenomenon in relation to ideals of recycling. The story, as McAdams tells it, goes this way. Initially, recycling is a somewhat eccentric practice engaged in only by the environmental enthusiast extreme. Within that group, however, recycling gradually takes on the status of an appropriate ideal. And in the process, the practice accumulates an increasingly articulate normative defence. With that normative defence in place, those who recycle enjoy a certain level of esteem, at least from among the environmentally conscious. Recycling comes to signal a special environmental sensitivity that even those who don’t practise it are increasingly inclined to applaud. More and more people recycle in response to the esteem attached to the practice—and gradually the practice becomes normal. Once normal, however, it no longer reflects any particular credit on its practitioners, so positive esteem evaporates. At the same time, those who don’t recycle now begin to become conspicuous. Their conduct increasingly reveals an environmental insensitivity that is at Wrst mildly irritating and then begins to seem, as it becomes rarer, positively intransigent. Eventually, an apparently stable equilibrium is reached in which the only non-compliers are the especially shameless, the determined anti-environmentalists, and those who like to oVend. The practice of recycling has become established, bootstrapped up from an initial situation in which the practice was relatively rare." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Part of the reason for our interest in publicity is that it seems to us to be the chief means by which the forces of esteem can be channelled and directed. By increasing the exposure afforded to performances, one can increase the associated esteem incentives without incidentally inducing changes in the basic operation of the esteem economy. Publicity is, in that sense, the main lever available for policy intervention." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Policy for increasing publicity—either by inhibiting secrecy (i.e. increasing the likelihood of observation) or by providing information/exposure on a subsidised basis—is one of the readiest means by which the economy of esteem can be supported by explicitly collective interventions. Equally, policies that support secrecy or require privacy or otherwise inhibit the extent of exposure are a primary means for undermining esteem-related incentives." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In his 1982 book The Rise and Decline of Nations, Mancur Olson argued that societies are engulfed in a perpetual struggle between producers and rent-seekers. The former invent and start businesses, increasing the national income; the latter try to profit off of the producers’ hard work by lobbying for special privileges like monopolies and tax farms. In contrast to Douglass North, who emphasized the importance of secure property rights for economic growth, Olson distinguished between good and bad forms. Bad property rights entitled a specific group to subsidies or protections that imposed costs on consumers and inhibited growth—like, say, a local monopoly on woolen cloth weaving allowing a guild to suppress machinery in favor of labor-intensive hand labor, lowering productivity and output.
>
> Backed by its elite commercial and landed classes, the English and eventually British state came to favor the removal of the barriers to growth that had plagued most pre-modern economies. “Peace and easy taxes,” contra Smith, isn’t a sufficient condition for endogenous development, but its inverse—domestic chaos and rent-seeking—may be sufficient for its absence." - [Institutional Reforms Built the British Empire, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/31/institutional-reforms-built-the-british-empire/)



> "Economist Glen Weyl’s proposal for a tax based on a self-evaluated sales price for such monopolies, at which the owner is thereafter compelled to sell the monopoly right, seems particularly appropriate for these cases. This tax would deal with the holdout problem by requiring that registered property be self-assessed in value. Firms would then pay a percentage of that value as a tax. Market discipline forces them to honestly disclose their true valuation of ownership rights: the obligation to sell if offered their stated price prevents undervaluation, while the tax on the same value penalizes them for overvaluation.
>
> If firms faced the possibility of a mandatory sale of their intellectual property, they would likely be much more open to licensing it. This would open the possibility of greater competition while also spreading technological advances more rapidly. Both of these mechanisms allow for greater economic efficiency and less wasted effort in the creation of redundant technologies and in litigation over patents. But insofar as this ownership grants legitimate value, particularly in terms of gains from research and innovation, companies would be able to take advantage of it —and be properly priced for the privilege of doing so. By employing a legal framework based on understanding the value of property as a mechanism and the incentives of large firms, the state can both harness the power of intellectual property and pre-empt their stagnation. If another firm were able to use the intellectual property rights to a certain technology more profitably, they could gain control of it." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "Simply put, that amount of disposable cash makes firms difficult to regulate and prosecute, as they can retain legal resources far in excess of what the government can pit against them. And it’s not clear that their ability to buy start-ups is always economically efficient. While they may scale up new technologies at times, in many cases truly disruptive technologies or products are underdeveloped when they are owned by the exact firms they would disrupt. Reducing firms’ ability to accumulate such an enormous amount of liquidity may require a direct tax on the revenues of the largest firms in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets. Natural monopolies are effectively private rights to extract rents from the economy. Taxing these rents by some means shifts the tax burden off of more efficiently productive work, diminishes the incentives for cornering the market, and reduces the ability to accumulate too much cash. Of course this must be balanced with the value of private earned wealth for investment, and the financial incentive for innovation, which often creates new monopolies." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "A competent regulatory structure must be able to referee the claims of consumers, employees, vendors, and the state, and ensure that the inevitable scale of these natural monopolies is not used to unfairly disadvantage other stakeholders.
>
> Our current FTC, Antitrust Division, Department of Commerce, and other government departments are of course inadequate to the task of applying this paradigm. They don’t currently have the competence to assess various claims by stakeholders, and how those interests can be coordinated with each other, with national interests more generally, and with interests of state. Nor is there any politically realistic path by which they could gain these capabilities in the short term.

> They would need to operate on a strategic vision for the economy.

> "It even extends to information. A New York Times profile of changes in Facebook’s corporate governance had a buried lede: “On Jan. 27, at a regularly scheduled Monday morning meeting with top executives at Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg turned the agenda to the coronavirus. For weeks, he told his staff, he had been hearing from global health care experts that the virus had the makings of a pandemic, and now Facebook needed to prepare for a worst-case scenario…” Mark Zuckerberg is a busy guy; he’s trying to fend off Google, Snapchat, the U.S. government, the EU, and the media. And he had time to read up on an obscure public health issue in China months before it was on most people’s radars. Jeff Bezos was a bit later to act, but he, too, took more day-to-day control over his company as the crisis ramped up. Why did these companies succeed where the U.S. federal and state governments failed?" - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "The gap between Facebook’s response at one end and California’s at the other showcases the difference between high-agency institutions and institutions ruled by drift and inertia. Facebook is not supposed to be a government—handwavy claims about its 2.6 billion digital citizens notwithstanding, Facebook is ultimately subordinate to the requests of national governments, and doesn’t exercise any form of sovereignty.
>
> It does, however, have part of the incentive structure of good government: since Facebook is so large, and its roster of advertisers is so lengthy, it’s exposed to broad negative and positive externalities. All else being equal, anything that makes U.S. small businesses grow a bit faster will make them spend more money on Facebook; anything that makes it harder for the average person to access the Internet—or that makes the average person less willing to bother—will hurt them. This doesn’t mean that Facebook’s incentives align perfectly with the greater good (they want to grow the pie, but they’re just as happy to take a bigger slice instead). But it does mean that they can act according to their indirect interests rather than direct ones.
>
> Financial markets ultimately help with this, because Facebook is valued highly relative to its sales. Every dollar of incremental sales for Facebook creates about $9 of market value, about $2.50 of which accrues to Mark Zuckerberg personally. And that value is based on Facebook’s long-term outlook; a high-multiple stock establishes a favorable exchange rate between the distant future and the immediate present, giving companies an incentive to make very long-term decisions even at the cost of short-term harms. Facebook, for example, noticed in 2018 that news stories led to vigorous discussion but fewer emotionally rewarding interactions, so they penalized those stories in their algorithm. This hurt their 2018 ad revenues, but benefited their 2030 active user counts, exactly the sort of tradeoff a controlling shareholder would prefer to make." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Idealists believe that every institution exists to build a better future for its participants. Cynics think every institution exists to perpetuate its own existence for the current benefit of whoever is in charge. The realist approach is to accept the cynical view as the ultimate asymptote to which all institutions trend, and to create incentives that align cynical self-preservation with prosocial behavior. Amazon employees who worked extra hours and took personal risk to keep delivering packages weren’t doing it to keep the economy afloat; they wanted bonuses, and they didn’t want to get fired. Facebook and Twitter didn’t send employees home out of pure altruism; they did it because operational disruptions are bad for business." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Technology companies responded fast because they’re in the habit of acting. Other institutions responded slowly, because they’re in the habit of reacting, and a novel infectious disease did not have a default institutional reaction. Ultimately, there’s a teleological difference between these institutions. Tech companies have a defined purpose, and they’re a vehicle for achieving that purpose. Google wants to organize the world’s information, and turning a gigantic profit while doing so is one of their operating constraints. SpaceX wants to make humans a multi-planetary species, and submitting competitive bids for rocket launches is an early step to accomplish this. But the U.S. government doesn’t have a defined purpose, just a long list of functions, and those functions aren’t regularly interrogated. It’s uncomfortable for modern Americans to ask what the ultimate goal of the government is... But an institution without an ultimate purpose is functionally dead. The only question is how long it takes for entropy to win." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "When asked why his bank was so profitable in the face of a sluggish American recovery, he replied: “The people of Goldman Sachs are among the most productive in the world.”
>
> Arguably, he was doing the duty of a CEO in defending his employees under media pressure. Still, it was high praise for a sector whose recklessness had thrown the world’s richest economy into chaos and who were rewarded for it with a bailout deal. And it raised a further question that had suddenly become relevant again because of the crisis: productive by what measure?
>
> When Mariana Mazzucato discusses that question, the Blankfein quote remains one of her favorite go-to’s. Based at University College London and founder of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, Mazzucato has spent her professional career on answering it. Her latest book on the topic is The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy, published in 2018.
>
> The book is a tour de force of economics, history, and policy. Such breadth is arguably necessary for Mazzucato’s fundamental goal: reopening the debate about economic value, what it includes, and who has the power to define it. What should count as real economic wealth? Who truly creates it, who merely assists the process, and who might be actively impeding it? The answers to that question have directed how economies develop, how governments direct or impede production, and what forms of economic power come to dominate human life.
>
> Once, the question of value dominated economic discourse. The French physiocrats argued that wealth was produced from the land. Conversely, Adam Smith tended to see landlords as a rentier class. Marx famously defined labor itself as the source of value. But this debate about value, once core to economic discourse, has long been de-emphasized in the discipline. As Mazzucato demonstrates, the marginal revolution in economics heralded a subjective, utility-focused approach that effectively sidestepped the historic debate about value—a sidestep that, in Mazzucato’s telling, drastically impoverished the discipline. An undergrad student today is likely to hear the above names once or twice in the opening lecture of an introductory course, and then only as a one-off primer. How did this happen?
>
> Following a historical primer on how the question of value was obscured, the book takes the reader through the successive results. Chief among these are the rise of financial power and its cannibalization of large parts of economic life, the extractive institutions in technological and medical innovation, and the gutting of a once-innovative and bold public sector, which had produced immense value across fields from consumer technology to medical products.
>
> Ultimately, Mazzucato exposes an orthodoxy of silence about value in modern economics, as well as in government. This orthodoxy, claims Mazzucato, has undermined public and private institutions and fundamentally weakened the ability of modern neoliberal economies to innovate." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "Smith also highlighted what he considered to be the great enemy of production: monopolistic power. Rentier landlords, mercantilist protectionism, and competition-stifling guilds were impediments to the market’s freedom. Unlike many who invoke him in the present, Smith saw government as playing a leading role in establishing what he defined as a ‘free market’: one free from rent-seeking monopoly power, not from government regulation." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "The notion that finance is part of the productive sphere at all is relatively new in the history of economic development. Aquinas and other medieval thinkers treated it with suspicion, Adam Smith more or less ignored it, and Marx treated it as part of capital’s “circulation phase.” Economists in the 20th century also critiqued it—Mazzucato notes Keynes and Minsky—but these warnings were not earth-shaking at a time when financial services were a very low share of national output. Interestingly, Mazzucato points out that Keynes prefigured modern concerns about finance’s brain drain of engineers and scientists with his quip that, rather than participating in a success story of laissez-faire capitalism, “the best brains of Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object.”
>
> ...
>
> Finance’s case is founded on the notion that it is a necessary part of spurring production by allocating capital. This is true, in a basic sense. Household savings don’t always cover costs, and business revenues don’t always cover investments. If finance merely pooled and directed resources to match these needs, it would not be a very exceptional industry. But in reality, finance does much more. Like other firms, banks are profit-driven. Rather than simple matchmaking, they act strategically to channel their revenues, especially into interest payments and toward shareholders. This logic fuels speculation bubbles, which are then continually refinanced through securitization and other strategies for inflating assets without investment." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)
