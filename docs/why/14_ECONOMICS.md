As John Maynard Keynes wrote in the conclusion of his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, “The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else.”
From John Maynard Keynes’s 1936 The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, ch 24, part V.

"Why isn't economics an evolutionary science?" by Thorstein Veblen 1 century ago
"why not also a thermodynamic, information-theoretic science? A system of free-energy minimization within constraints"

the genius of markets is not necessarily in its efficiency and allocation, but in creating an evolutionary competition for solving human problems

business is about solving human problems, the role of the state is to create the conditions for large-scale cooperation to allow that process to happen. That means:
- promoting inclusion - no large-scale cooperation if excluding large groups of people
- need fair social contract
- institutions that build trust: rule of law, money, regulation
- also need the state to solve collective action problems to grease the wheels of cooperation

In a democratic system people have a right - even a duty - to define the fitness function that the market system is evolving towards.
Social equity, climate change & others are valid social concerns that should be reflected in that market fitness function.

We should worry more about creating a healthy ecology that promotes real tangible improvements in people's lives and less worrying about theoretical trade-offs and efficiency...?
Instead of thinking of markets and states as competitors - think of them as a joint system.
This ecology has lots of different forms of organization, not just markets and states, but a broader zoo of forms.

Dominant ideology: pursuing self-interest is good.
One of the most dangerous ideas in economics: Methodological individualism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism
This led to Margaret Thatcher's quote "there's no such thing as society" which leads to one no longer believing that society can act together to handle climate change or other technological challenges.
At the root of this is a confusion between collectivism, which the neoliberals critiqued, quite rightly, versus solving collective-action problems.
One of the big successes of the Enlightenment was the emphasis on individual freedom, individual rights & so on, a huge jump for mankind. But then, taking that to an extreme, we lose sight of our ability to work together to solve collective-action problems.
We have to rediscover ways to create an ideology and system of thought that allows us to tackle existential problems together.

^^ many of the above points have been taken from santa fe economics simposium - have only a screenshot from my phone of the text on my kindle - can't properly attribute now to who said it

M. O. Jackson on our ignorance of what the state does... Part of the problem is ignorance. It's easy to be ignorant of all the things the state does. What if we had an accurate and real-time representation of the budget that we could inspect and try to allocate differently and reason through that - on a national/state/local level and so forth? People need an impression how much goes into each part like roads, K-12 education, etc. You need to see the numbers in order to also see the tradeoffs. People are ignorant of the scope and size of the state. Removing this ignorance is a good step towards more trust & understanding.

E. D. Beinhocker: One big thing that Hayek got right was, in complex social systems predicting the future is a dangerous business. Popper's answer to that challenge was what he called "piecemeal social engineering", so he was very much against Utopianism and kind of big grand plans. But he saw that in the historical records... that you make reforms one step at a time. You sort of march your way forward and you try stuff and not everything works but some stuff does work and you do more of what works and less of what doesn't. That's an evolutionary process. And evolution can grope its way toward whatever goals exist in a complex system. One could argue the three great inventions of the Enlightenment - taking into account the blind spots - were three evolutionary systems: science, which is an evolutionary epistemological system; democracy, which is a kind of evolutionary political system; and markets, which are an evolutionary economic system. But... in recent decades we've had an ideology that has said the only fitness function that matters is the maximization of self-interest and a narrow definition of profits and so on. So, we've had a system that has been adapting to that and giving us the results that we have today. One of the key ways to handle these big challenges is to reinvigorate these evolutionary processes in our society and get them pointed at solving our biggest societal challenges.

It is perhaps time to rethink what we call this economic system. The web of financial flows making up our society is not one that is greatly defined by the spending of individual billionaires. It is rather less of an intricate, flexible, organic web, and more of a rigid grid taking its shape from various large bureaucratic organizations." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781279198929182)

The Pentagon alone spends 4 Elon Musks each year. Billionaire spending is a few drops in the bucket. The U.S. government spends more on kidney dialysis in Medicare ($28B) than it allots to NASA ($25B). More federal money is spent each year on soda and sweetened drinks (~$10.5B) than Elon Musk could spend if he wanted to spend his whole fortune to the last penny before he died." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781219727917485)



> "Healthy life grows and becomes looked upon with envy. This is, after all, the only meaning of market capitalization: how much do others want what you have built? But we mustn’t confuse this financial growth for purpose. The purpose of your empire is some higher task that you have built it to accomplish. Its nature is not its market capitalization and financial flows, but the whole system of machinery that gives it a very particular strategic position and animates it towards that particular task. Financial growth is simply one operational constraint among many towards the accomplishment of its visionary ends. Ironically, it is these focused strategic empires that display the best financial performance. But don’t let the venture capitalists confuse you: that is not what is important about them." - [Quit Your Job, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/)



> "When people talk about a “market economy”, what exactly does that mean? You might assume it means a society where all or most economic decisions are made through markets. But this does not describe our own economy, or anything else that gets called a “market economy”. Most economic decisions are made inside particular organizations, which make their internal decisions according to hierarchical structures and individual judgment, taking markets into account as one factor among many. If two workers both want to avoid a Monday morning shift, or two department heads are arguing over hiring policy, or two engineers are debating which design to adopt, no one expects the people involved to start setting prices and bidding against each other like they would in a market. And yet markets are nevertheless crucial to our economic organization, in ways that are notably different from non-“market economies”. How, then, does the market fit in?
>
> What markets make possible is smooth interaction between independent units. Organizations have hierarchical control over their own assets, including very complex social processes like medical schools or aircraft control towers, but they also need to coordinate with other parts of society external to the organization itself, like customers and suppliers. Markets make this easy and reliable. The market is a thin layer of crucial but simple social technology that lets an organization ignore the deep complexity of the people and organizations it interacts with. This is helpful because the market interface an organization presents to the outside world is so much simpler than the non-market-based coordination it uses internally.
>
> In a way, the market is like the docking module between the Apollo and Soyuz rockets. It’s a crucial component, and without it the entire system couldn’t possibly function as a unified whole, but it’s still a relatively small fraction of the system’s mass and complexity. Understanding how it works won’t tell you all that much about how the Soyuz itself works." - [Markets Are Thin, by Ben Landau-Taylor](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/markets-are-thin#:~:text=When%20people%20talk,Soyuz%20itself%20works.)

They're so hi-tech that they can take in a protein, disassemble it, build a new protein (perhaps an entirely different kind) and issue the new protein.

Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today.

> "As the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decisionmaking and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the “homo economicus” with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a “homo socialis” with other-regarding preferences. While the “homo economicus” optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the “homo socialis” are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. Notably, the “homo socialis” manages to earn higher payoffs than the “homo economicus”.
>
> I show that the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the “homo economicus” (“economics 1.0”), a complementary theory must be developed for the “homo socialis”. This economic theory might be called “economics 2.0” or “socionomics”. The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as “participatory market society”.
>
> To thrive, the “homo socialis” requires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation systems, which will be sketched in this paper. I also propose a new kind of money, so-called “qualified money”, which may overcome some of the problems of our current financial system." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In the past, societies have invented various institutions to overcome “tragedies of the commons”, for example, genetic favoritism, direct reciprocity (“I help you, if you help me”), or punitive institutions (such as police, courts, prisons and regulatory authorities). However, all of these mechanisms can lead to undesirable side effects such as civil wars or corruption. Our current system is built on punitive institutions, but such top-down regulation is very costly and creates many inefficiencies, including negative impacts on innovation." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In the situation studied above, where everyone starts as a defecting “homo economicus”, no single individual can establish profitable cooperation, not even by optimizing decisions over an infinitely long time horizon. It takes a few “friendly” deviations to trigger cascade effects that eventually change the macro-level outcome. Therefore, it is important to recognize that a critical number of interacting individuals need to be friendly and cooperative by coincidence. The “homo socialis” would never evolve without the occurrence of random “mistakes” (here: the birth of “idealists” who are exploited by everyone). However, given suitable feedback effects, such “errors” enable better outcomes. Here, they eventually overcome the “tragedy of the commons” (Hardin, 1968), resulting in an “upward spiral” towards cooperation with high payoffs. Remarkably, this is not the outcome of an optimization process, but rather of an evolutionary process.
>
> ... In accordance with a lot of work in social psychology, the “homo socialis” may be characterized by “empathy” in the sense that the “homo socialis” puts himself or herself into the shoes of others. More precisely, the “homo socialis” takes into account the perspective, interests, and success of others when taking own decisions.17 This effectively explains the fairness preference observed in behavioral economics (G¨uth et al., 1982; Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Henrich et al., 2001; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). Note, however, that the “homo socialis” should not be imagined as a “homo economicus” sharing some payoff with others. The “homo socialis” decides differently from the “homo economicus”, and that is why “tragedies of the commons” can be overcome.
>
> Decisions of the “homo socialis” are interdependent, in contrast to the “homo economicus”, who takes decisions indendently without the consideration of effects on others. Therefore, the “homo socialis” may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. This implies a complex dynamics of systems where many such decision-makers interact, with important economic implications (Helbing and Kirman, 2013). While methods from statistics should be good enough to characterize the “homo economicus”, the description of the “homo socialis” requires methods drawn from complexity science." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In other words, in social dilemma situations, Adam Smith’s principle of the “invisible hand” works only for the “homo socialis”, but not for the “homo economicus”. Without suitable institutional settings or regulations, the “homo economicus” will run into a “tragedy of the commons” with very poor payoffs for the great majority. Note that the principle of the “invisible hand” would work for the “homo economicus” as well, if the underlying assumptions of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics were fulfilled, i.e. if all individuals would interact in one shared market without transaction costs and externalities (Arrow and Debreu, 1954; Debreu, 1959). However, these assumptions are quite restrictive, and the macro-level outcome depends on them in a sensitive manner...
>
> As the “homo economicus” decides strictly according to self-interest, the coordination of decisionmakers and efforts to overcome “tragedies of the commons” or market failures requires some kind of top-down regulation. This results in a steadily growing number of laws and regulations and costly investments into regulatory and sanctioning institutions (such as police, courts, market regulators, etc.). This can significantly decrease systemic efficiency. In addition, regulation tends to reduce diversity, which can affect innovation in a negative way.
>
> In comparison with the “homo economicus”, the “homo socialis” is able to cope with social dilemma situations based on local interactions. I will characterize this as bottom-up self-regulation, considering that the emergent level of “friendliness” overcoming the “tragedy of the commons” results from a decentralized, evolutionary process. Since top-down regulation (as required for the “homo economicus”) is just the opposite of bottom-up self-regulation (as typical for the “homo socialis”), it is misleading to say that the “homo socialis” is just a variant of the “homo economicus” or vice versa. Speaking metaphorically, the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” must be distinguished like night and day. This is mainly due to the discontinuous transition in the systemic outcome when the “friendliness” increases beyond a certain critical level (“tipping point”). Passing the tipping point is like switching the light on or off, with dramatic impacts on the average payoff.

> The existence of two different kinds of people, the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis”, has relevant practical implications: A second body of work must be developed for the “homo socialis” to supplement the extant economic body of work for the “homo economicus”. I will call the science of the “homo economicus” - “economics”, and the science of the “homo socialis” “socionomics” or also “economics 2.0” in order to reflect that the Web 2.0 is a key factor promoting a “participatory market society”.  It is important to note that our understanding of socionomics does not assume emotionally or irrationally acting agents. In the simulations underlying Figs. 1 and 2, the “homo socialis” decides rationally, trying to optimize the individual utility, but this utility also reflects the externalities of others. In social dilemma situations, the “homo socialis” can outperform the “homo economicus” through reaching higher payoffs.

> Figure 5: Table highlighting the differences between the nature of a central planner, the “homo economicus”, and the “homo socialis”, including their different system dynamics and systemic outcomes. The First Theorem of Welfare Economics(Arrow and Debreu, 1954; Debreu, 1959), which states that competitive markets lead to an efficient allocation of resources, only holds if there is a complete set of markets and all market participants are price-takers, and there are neither externalities nor transaction costs. As conventional market economies tend to create negative externalities, top-down regulation by a strong state is needed to counter related market failures. Examples of negative externalities are resource depletion and environmental pollution, which eventually lead to the creation of regulatory institutions such as the emission trading scheme or financial regulatory authorities. As regulation tends to be costly for regulators and regulated agents, bottom-up self-regulation is expected to unleash large creative potentials of “networked minds”, which are currently not fully used (see Sec. 7). The performance gains may well be comparable to the gains when moving from a top-down regulation to a conventional market economy building on self-organization (see Sec. 5.1). “Socionomies” (also called “economies 2.0” or “participatory market societies”), are characterized by high levels of cooperation, established through self-regulation. To protect a “homo socialis” from being exploited, it is important to know whether one is interacting with another “homo socialis” or a “homo economicus”. Therefore, suitable institutions such as reputation mechanisms need to be established, which allow like-minded agents to interact successfully, and differently minded agents to cope with each other. Examples for socionomic systems are Wikipedia, Open Streetmap, open source software communities (such as Linux or GitHub), and social media platforms. Note that the “homo socialis” should not be confused with someone, who is redistributing gains. A redistribution strategy (via donations, or taxes and social benefit systems) might be able to “heal” or reduce problems such as an “unhealthy” degree of inequality, but it would usually not be able to avoid or overcome “tragedies of the commons”. Hence, redistribution is inefficient and often not a suitable solution for social dilemma situations (see also footnote 27). The main difference to the “homo economicus” is that the “homo socialis” decides more “responsibly” or “wisely”, considering not only the own interests, but also those of others when taking self-determined decisions. If enough people do this, other-regarding preferences pays off.
>
> ...
>
> In conclusion, a central regulator fails to be efficient for lack of computational capacity, which is required to handle the algorithmic complexity of a NP-hard optimization problem within large system in real-time. Applying the principle of the “homo economicus” on a local level, fails due to lack of coordination. In contrast, the approach of the other-regarding “homo socialis” can overcome both problems by combining self-organization with self-regulation. A self-regulation based on suitable local interactions can produce resource-efficient solutions delivering high system performance.23 These solutions also tend to be resilient to perturbations (such as accidents, road works, etc.). Again, the “homo socialis” can make the principle of the “invisible hand” work under conditions, where it fails for the independent optimization attempts of a “homo economicus” (see Fig. 7). Many of the above conclusions also seem to be relevant for socio-economic systems, when agents have incompatible interests that cannot be satisfied at the same time." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

We need to crowdsource the quantification of how much anything costs

Here’s what the operating system for humanity should enable: state a problem and incentivize someone to solve it. Recursively/iteratively and in parallel - pointing to problems, ranking them, and rewarding for them being solved

We need to move from a money-on-money-return world to a transparency-on-transparency-return world

Capitalism is suffering from opacity

The metaverse is a parallel economy
Parallel media, economy & governance

Laissez-faire capitalism needs to end
We're in a free for all and that should scare everybody

The invisible hand has no competition - it’s left unchecked and is ripping meaning and morals out of our civilization. If you truly care about competition we should introduce it at the most fundamental level and give rise to another invisible hand that’s not fungible to material possessions but is all about the meaning of life and recognition by and connection to others.
We need a meta-invisible hand that will tune the relationship and distribution of money (claims over resources) and human values


An open-source economy

the biggest harms in the world come from opaqueness on the enterprise level

We have to incentivise contribution to the common good and we have to decouple that from resources - we need a new incentive

The completely open global do-it-all company

A publicly run parallel socioeconomic system embedded within the current one - parasitizing it from within

# SECTION: Redirecting surplus
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "From surplus above subsistence, we get the whole mass of profits, savings, investment, and consumption of luxury commodities. In capitalism, ownership of this surplus, much of which is spent on luxury, has been used as an incentive to increase production and boost growth; it is what encourages investors to invest, savers to save, and landlords to rent. The disproportionate power of billionaires and the effort of those who aspire to such levels of wealth is this incentive in action. But like all things in economics, this incentive is a tradeoff. There are costs to this luxurious incentive mechanism: the production costs of the luxury goods themselves, the free time afforded to those who have secured the means of their substance without labor, the redundancies of production demanded by market competition and consumer choice, the power and talent directed into the zero-sum games in the financial industry which must manage this accumulated wealth, and the speculative bubbles which naturally result from such accumulation." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "Our popular orthodoxies around economics have made us forget the distinction between needs and wants... All luxury, and all property, is premised on the existence of society reproducing itself. If we choose to value things which are in fact luxuries over those things which are in fact necessities, we may find ourselves having neither. Those moments where social reproduction totally breaks down are the object of fear for civilization itself: plagues, wars, famines, and general economic and political collapse." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "It’s often been declared that the USSR fell because it failed to innovate, or that the planning system couldn’t adequately allocate capital and resources without price signals. But this explanation is more drawn from the theoretical logic of markets than on studying the actual history of the country. In reality, the USSR had one of the best-educated populations in the world, and scientists who produced many cutting-edge advancements. But there is an important distinction between scientific innovation and innovation in the production process. That distinction makes it clear why a tradeoff exists, and just why incentive systems matter.
>
> While Soviet scientists did innovate in technology, there was no incentive to implement innovations in the production process. Enterprises would reject using the latest, most efficient machines because doing so would mean fewer resources allocated to the enterprise, which would mean less power and wealth for the managers and bureaucrats in charge of it—not to mention, for those they could bribe. More efficiency meant that an enterprise could make do with less, and therefore the planners would ratchet back those resources. This led to systemic hoarding.
>
> Soviet planners, while always in a battle with enterprises for accurate statistics, were generally good at allocating capital and labor to high productivity sectors of the economy. This was how the USSR was able to achieve such high growth up until its stagnation in the 70s. But after the easy gains of industrialization were won, the tendency against changes to the plan won out. The more changes that were proposed, the more computational adjustments would be required, and the more mistakes became possible. This is where focusing on necessity alone can go awry.
>
> The economic plan could secure the necessities of social reproduction, but the incentives to use surplus production for growth existed on paper only. The flaw in the Soviet system was that the mere existence of surplus does not necessarily imply growth. A society can maintain the same level of surplus by simply consuming or squandering all surplus beyond what is required to replace existing capital stocks. This is what happened in the USSR but in a very unusual way. The planners were well aware of the need to implement new innovations to grow, and allocated some 25-35% of GDP towards investment (the all-time U.S. high in the postwar period is roughly 20%). But because much of this investment was not utilized, it was merely consuming surplus. Hence, the stagnation of the late USSR.
>
> But take careful note: social reproduction as such did not break down until there was an attempt to transition towards more liberal, market-based institutions. The severe depression was not directly caused by the failures of Soviet economic planning, but by the breakdown of social institutions and the systemic theft of formerly state-owned enterprises by Russia’s rising oligarchs. It was only when the planning system was replaced by an incentive system that demanded a much higher level of immediate luxury for the oligarchs that society could no longer hold together. An economic system that lacks growth may be maladapted for great power competition and economic development, but one which ignores the requirements for social reproduction will fail spectacularly in both the short and long term." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "We live in a world characterized by big numbers and non-linear systems. Don’t let civilization and all its technological and moral trappings fool you; the threats presented by our own growth are just as existential as those faced by our ancestors. We have never been above nature; we will never escape our war with her." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "Much can be imagined, given the will to see surplus as something to be allocated strategically, and see beyond luxury as the sole motivation for production. This new kind of austerity regime would make certain goods more expensive in the short-term as well as put downward pressure on profits. That is the price we would have to pay. Economics is about trade-offs, after all. But it also comes with its own luxuries for normal people, those who are essential for the reproduction of our society. Job security, healthcare, and education, which have increasingly become essentials for reproduction of our society, could cease to be treated as privileges. But such a program would require the development of a state consciousness among the powerful quasi-governing segments of American society that currently conceive of themselves as private actors without public duty. Without a change in consciousness, to see that their interests are intimately tied to the public interest, they may find themselves more comfortable with the continued decline of American civilization. To those concerned with its preservation, among the elite and in the general population, there can be nothing more misguided than the clutching at private wants against public needs with such pathological drive." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "The three ruling passions in human life are often said to be the desire for property, the desire for power, and the desire for prestige or status or esteem. The eVects of the Wrst desire are charted in standard economics, the eVects of the second in political science—and of course in the annals of history. But the eVects of the desire for esteem have escaped the sustained attention of social scientists. It is almost as if there were a conspiracy not to register or document the fact that we are, and always have been, an honour-hungry species." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "What economics and politics reveal in the domain of property and power is that the unintended consequences of people’s desires congeal into aggregate patterns that affect in turn what individuals can and choose to do. The competition for property dictates the prices at which individual goods can be obtained, for example, while the competition for power dictates the opportunities for individuals to find a place among others and to exercise influence. Both disciplines, however, have a normative as well as a positive or empirical side. They not only seek to reveal how things actually turn out as a result of people’s interactions, but also try to identify ways in which they might be made to turn out better. Thus economics specialises in identifying more efficient systems of production and distribution, politics in charting more stable ways of organising the dispensation whereby power is allocated among individuals and groups. And specialists in each discipline equally argue for improvements that would have beneficial consequences, not just for endogenous ideals like efficiency and stability, but also for ideals—perhaps more controversial ideals—like freedom, community, and equality.
>
> We see no reason why there shouldn’t be a study that serves these same positive and normative ends in regard to the system generated by people’s desire for esteem. Were it distinct enough to earn a Greek name on a par with ‘economics’ and ‘politics’, we might call it ‘kudonomics’: the study of the laws governing the system of kudos or renown... There is an economy in property, an economy in power, and there is also, so we believe, an economy in esteem." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Economies are systems whereby scarce resources are allocated among competing parties. In particular, they are systems of allocation that have an interactive or aggregative dimension. What individual agents do gives rise to aggregate patterns that feed back in turn into the things that determine what individual agents do; they feed back, for example, into the determination of people’s opportunities and expectations. This more or less standard account of an economy is completely general, abstracting from the sorts of resources that are allocated...
>
> Our aim in this book is to look at the scope for studying, in the manner of an economics, the system whereby perhaps the most important resource of this attitudinal kind—esteem—is allocated among individuals...
>
> Esteem cannot be given away or traded in the ordinary manner, for there is no way that I can buy the good opinion of another or sell to others my good opinion of them... But though it is non-tradable in that sense, esteem is still a good that is allocated in society according to more or less systematic determinants; and it is a good whose allocation has an interactive, aggregative aspect. Thus there is room, at least on the face of it, for studying both the positive results of that emerging pattern and the normative prospects for changing that pattern in a way that is generally beneficial." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Some economists will say that esteem is taken into account in standard theory to the extent that reputation—say, the reputation for delivering on time or for delivering at a certain level of quality—is seen as an important resource for someone in the market. But reputation is distinct from esteem in our sense. Esteem may accrue to someone who is not reidentifiable—someone who lacks a recognisable name or face—whereas reputation presupposes reidentifiability. And the two notions come apart even where reidentifiability is assumed...
>
> The tendency among economists who discuss the value of reputation is to see it as deriving entirely from the value of the commodities it enables an agent to secure. Like money, esteem is taken to give an agent a certain purchasing power in the domain of consumption goods—an expectation of being able to use it to obtain such goods—and that is assumed to be the reason it is attractive. We do not think that this reductionist view of market reputation carries over to esteem more generally. We seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among people we are very unlikely to meet again; we even seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among those who will live after our time and whom we will never meet. It is hard to see how this could make sense if esteem had no value for us other than as a means of securing consumption goods." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "The economics of any system of allocation tries not just to understand the system, as mentioned, but also to see how far it can be made to work better and to work for the better promotion of what is regarded as the common good. It constitutes a normative as well as a positive economics. And there is enormous scope, it turns out, for exploring the normative potential of the economy of esteem.
>
> It is common nowadays to think that there are only two reliable controls available for ensuring that people will act in a manner that conduces to the common good: the one is the invisible hand of the market, the other the iron hand of law and administration—the iron hand of the state... Governments have tried to market more and more of the services that used to be provided in the non-marketed sector of the economy—services in education, research, health, counselling, and the like. And, where marketing is impossible or problematic, they have sought to impose a tougher regime of monitoring and management: they have tried to subject those providing the services to ever more intrusive forms of surveillance and accounting.
>
> We think that this dichotomous picture of regulatory possibilities is misconceived. In particular, we think that it overlooks the possibility of subjecting people to a quite different sort of discipline: that involved in being required to act so as to secure esteem and escape disesteem. We think of this discipline as an intangible hand that complements the invisible and iron hands that have monopolised the attention of regulators. The forces of esteem are distinctively associated, not with the market, and not with the state, but with what is nowadays often described as civil society. One of the most interesting projects in institutional design is to investigate the conditions under which the intangible hand can be expected to work well and, in particular, to work for the production of what is generally seen as the common good.
>
> The distinction between the iron hand, the invisible hand, and the intangible hand is analytically well grounded. The iron hand involves actions that intentionally sanction agents—reward or punish them—so that they behave in a certain way; it is represented, for example, in the legal and regulatory initiatives of the state. The invisible hand also involves actions that serve to sanction agents—for example, the actions of consumers in seeking out the cheapest provider of a certain good—but those actions are not designed intentionally to elicit a certain pattern of behaviour, such as competitive pricing; they serve as rewards and penalties that elicit that pattern but they are not necessarily intended by their agents in that role. The intangible hand is like the invisible hand, and unlike the iron hand, in deploying non-intentional sanctions of this kind. But it is unlike the invisible hand, in that the sanctions deployed involve the formation of attitudes—rewards of esteem, penalties of disesteem—not, or at least not necessarily, the performance of actions." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Adam Smith, the founder of economics, was himself a great believer in the attraction that people feel for esteem, and the repulsion that they feel for disesteem. ‘Nature, when she formed man for society’, he wrote, ‘endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original aversion to offend his brethren. She taught him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regard’. In adopting this view, Smith was following a tradition of emphasis on the importance of the esteem motive that had been present in Western thought in the time of the Greeks and the Romans, had resurfaced with emphasis in the Renaissance, and had become a major theme in the moral and social treatises of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries...
>
> The belief in the power of esteem led Smith even to argue that the reason why we seek out wealth, the reason why we want to have more and more to spend on what he called baubles and trinkets, is that by achieving conspicuousness in such possessions, we win distinction and esteem. ‘It is the vanity, not the ease or the pleasure, which interests us’. Writing in 1790, John Adams gave nice expression to the same idea. ‘Riches force the opinion on a man that he is the object of the congratulations of others; and he feels that they attract the complaisance of the public.’
>
> But this view that it is an interest in esteem that fuels the desire for material goods and services largely disappeared with the development of mainstream economics...
>
> We can think of three main reasons why esteem may have slipped out of focus among economists and social scientists in the two centuries since Smith wrote his path-breaking books. One is that with the advent of economics, in particular with the discovery of invisible-hand possibilities of social ordering, it became unfashionable to give attention to any mode of social discipline that invoked virtue in some way. Bernard Mandeville, in his Fable of the Bees, was very influential in preaching that private vice was public virtue and, albeit Smith wanted to distance himself from Mandevillean irony, the invisible hand gave a certain substance to that rather paradoxical lesson. The centrepiece example of the invisible hand was the open and free market in which, so it was claimed, the individual pursuit of advantage—shameless self-seeking, as it appeared to many—would guarantee that goods were made available, to the beneWt of all, at competitive prices.
>
> ... Esteem and virtue go closely together. Thus in letting go of individual virtue as a source of collective order, economists and social scientists may have let go at the same time of the desire for being thought to be virtuous as a source of such order." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "We believe, as Adam Smith believed, that it is nature that endows people with an attraction for esteem, not just the corrupt culture of an old-style aristocracy. We believe that even if the invisible hand is a potent force of social order, still there is a lot of force attaching also to the intangible hand." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Among the things that may be expected to move people most reliably and forcibly is the desire to be thought well of by their fellows and the aversion to being regarded badly. People, so it was generally held, live under the regime or law of opinion and that regime moulds all that they are and do. It provides a gravitational field that silently shapes their dispositions and their doings, exerting a long, insistent influence that can only be resisted at the cost of considerable effort and self-sacrifice." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In many cases... we will prefer someone to behave more virtuously, if with a greater desire for esteem, than to have them behave less virtuously but with a lesser concern to be admired." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Attitude-dependent goods of esteem may rationally be substituted by individuals for such material, action-dependent goods, as when someone foregoes a larger salary elsewhere in order to remain attached to a more estimable organisation—an organisation that may be expected to give them greater personal standing than the alternative—or when someone forgoes such esteem for a rise in salary." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Just as the economy of esteem is not insulated from the material economy or the regime of power, neither is it really a single, homogeneous system in itself. There will be many overlapping subsystems within the economy of esteem in almost any contemporary society. And almost every individual will belong to a number of those subsystems, having a stake in how he or she stands in each. The subsystems will compete with one another for the energy and time of participants. And they will often be in conflict, in the sense that a high performance in one will count against performing well in another. Teenagers at school will have a stake in how they are thought of by parents, teachers, and peers but will find, in all likelihood, that it is hard to do well simultaneously in each of those subcultures. Peers may deride them for a high standing in the other groups, for example, and may drive them into systematically underperforming on those fronts." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem incentives operate in a context where there are feedback eVects between individual action and the social context within which such action is pursued. The performance level of each individual contributes to the standards by which each performer is assessed. Accordingly, there are, as we might put it, unintended consequences in play in the economy of esteem. To appeal to the terminology of Schelling’s (1978) book, micro-motives create macro-behaviour patterns that are not simply a direct magnification of the individual case." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem eVects still play an extensive role, both in explaining the allocation of persons across activities that might be sources of esteem, and in disciplining poor performance and encouraging high performance in those domains that do not admit the possibility of exit." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "When the number of persons in a given population who comply is relatively small, there will be positive esteem associated with so acting. Then, as the number of compliers increases, the amount of esteem attached to so acting will decline and conceivably disappear. For example, when few people tell the truth, doing so will be remarkable and represent a potentially significant source of esteem. But when most people are telling the truth, truth-telling is unremarkable and its esteem utility on that account unlikely to be very high. However, this fact does not necessarily imply that, over the range where most people conform, esteem eVects disappear. For, as it becomes a matter of course that people comply, it tends to become a source of disesteem to fail to do so. Accordingly, esteem-based incentives to comply with the norm are operative with varying levels of intensity more or less over the whole range. At the same time, the level of compliance that is forthcoming will be a positive function of the amount of esteem attached. The larger the esteem reward for complying, and/or the larger the disesteem penalty for not complying, the higher the level of compliance is likely to be." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Richard McAdams (1997) offers an example of a possible bootstrap phenomenon in relation to ideals of recycling. The story, as McAdams tells it, goes this way. Initially, recycling is a somewhat eccentric practice engaged in only by the environmental enthusiast extreme. Within that group, however, recycling gradually takes on the status of an appropriate ideal. And in the process, the practice accumulates an increasingly articulate normative defence. With that normative defence in place, those who recycle enjoy a certain level of esteem, at least from among the environmentally conscious. Recycling comes to signal a special environmental sensitivity that even those who don’t practise it are increasingly inclined to applaud. More and more people recycle in response to the esteem attached to the practice—and gradually the practice becomes normal. Once normal, however, it no longer reflects any particular credit on its practitioners, so positive esteem evaporates. At the same time, those who don’t recycle now begin to become conspicuous. Their conduct increasingly reveals an environmental insensitivity that is at Wrst mildly irritating and then begins to seem, as it becomes rarer, positively intransigent. Eventually, an apparently stable equilibrium is reached in which the only non-compliers are the especially shameless, the determined anti-environmentalists, and those who like to oVend. The practice of recycling has become established, bootstrapped up from an initial situation in which the practice was relatively rare." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Part of the reason for our interest in publicity is that it seems to us to be the chief means by which the forces of esteem can be channelled and directed. By increasing the exposure afforded to performances, one can increase the associated esteem incentives without incidentally inducing changes in the basic operation of the esteem economy. Publicity is, in that sense, the main lever available for policy intervention." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Policy for increasing publicity—either by inhibiting secrecy (i.e. increasing the likelihood of observation) or by providing information/exposure on a subsidised basis—is one of the readiest means by which the economy of esteem can be supported by explicitly collective interventions. Equally, policies that support secrecy or require privacy or otherwise inhibit the extent of exposure are a primary means for undermining esteem-related incentives." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In his 1982 book The Rise and Decline of Nations, Mancur Olson argued that societies are engulfed in a perpetual struggle between producers and rent-seekers. The former invent and start businesses, increasing the national income; the latter try to profit off of the producers’ hard work by lobbying for special privileges like monopolies and tax farms. In contrast to Douglass North, who emphasized the importance of secure property rights for economic growth, Olson distinguished between good and bad forms. Bad property rights entitled a specific group to subsidies or protections that imposed costs on consumers and inhibited growth—like, say, a local monopoly on woolen cloth weaving allowing a guild to suppress machinery in favor of labor-intensive hand labor, lowering productivity and output.

> Backed by its elite commercial and landed classes, the English and eventually British state came to favor the removal of the barriers to growth that had plagued most pre-modern economies. “Peace and easy taxes,” contra Smith, isn’t a sufficient condition for endogenous development, but its inverse—domestic chaos and rent-seeking—may be sufficient for its absence." - [Institutional Reforms Built the British Empire, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/31/institutional-reforms-built-the-british-empire/)



> "Economist Glen Weyl’s proposal for a tax based on a self-evaluated sales price for such monopolies, at which the owner is thereafter compelled to sell the monopoly right, seems particularly appropriate for these cases. This tax would deal with the holdout problem by requiring that registered property be self-assessed in value. Firms would then pay a percentage of that value as a tax. Market discipline forces them to honestly disclose their true valuation of ownership rights: the obligation to sell if offered their stated price prevents undervaluation, while the tax on the same value penalizes them for overvaluation.
>
> If firms faced the possibility of a mandatory sale of their intellectual property, they would likely be much more open to licensing it. This would open the possibility of greater competition while also spreading technological advances more rapidly. Both of these mechanisms allow for greater economic efficiency and less wasted effort in the creation of redundant technologies and in litigation over patents. But insofar as this ownership grants legitimate value, particularly in terms of gains from research and innovation, companies would be able to take advantage of it —and be properly priced for the privilege of doing so. By employing a legal framework based on understanding the value of property as a mechanism and the incentives of large firms, the state can both harness the power of intellectual property and pre-empt their stagnation. If another firm were able to use the intellectual property rights to a certain technology more profitably, they could gain control of it." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "Simply put, that amount of disposable cash makes firms difficult to regulate and prosecute, as they can retain legal resources far in excess of what the government can pit against them. And it’s not clear that their ability to buy start-ups is always economically efficient. While they may scale up new technologies at times, in many cases truly disruptive technologies or products are underdeveloped when they are owned by the exact firms they would disrupt. Reducing firms’ ability to accumulate such an enormous amount of liquidity may require a direct tax on the revenues of the largest firms in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets. Natural monopolies are effectively private rights to extract rents from the economy. Taxing these rents by some means shifts the tax burden off of more efficiently productive work, diminishes the incentives for cornering the market, and reduces the ability to accumulate too much cash. Of course this must be balanced with the value of private earned wealth for investment, and the financial incentive for innovation, which often creates new monopolies." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "A competent regulatory structure must be able to referee the claims of consumers, employees, vendors, and the state, and ensure that the inevitable scale of these natural monopolies is not used to unfairly disadvantage other stakeholders.
>
> Our current FTC, Antitrust Division, Department of Commerce, and other government departments are of course inadequate to the task of applying this paradigm. They don’t currently have the competence to assess various claims by stakeholders, and how those interests can be coordinated with each other, with national interests more generally, and with interests of state.

> "It even extends to information. A New York Times profile of changes in Facebook’s corporate governance had a buried lede: “On Jan. 27, at a regularly scheduled Monday morning meeting with top executives at Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg turned the agenda to the coronavirus. For weeks, he told his staff, he had been hearing from global health care experts that the virus had the makings of a pandemic, and now Facebook needed to prepare for a worst-case scenario…” Mark Zuckerberg is a busy guy; he’s trying to fend off Google, Snapchat, the U.S. government, the EU, and the media. And he had time to read up on an obscure public health issue in China months before it was on most people’s radars. Jeff Bezos was a bit later to act, but he, too, took more day-to-day control over his company as the crisis ramped up. Why did these companies succeed where the U.S. federal and state governments failed?" - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "The gap between Facebook’s response at one end and California’s at the other showcases the difference between high-agency institutions and institutions ruled by drift and inertia. Facebook is not supposed to be a government—handwavy claims about its 2.6 billion digital citizens notwithstanding, Facebook is ultimately subordinate to the requests of national governments, and doesn’t exercise any form of sovereignty.
>
> It does, however, have part of the incentive structure of good government: since Facebook is so large, and its roster of advertisers is so lengthy, it’s exposed to broad negative and positive externalities. All else being equal, anything that makes U.S. small businesses grow a bit faster will make them spend more money on Facebook; anything that makes it harder for the average person to access the Internet—or that makes the average person less willing to bother—will hurt them. This doesn’t mean that Facebook’s incentives align perfectly with the greater good (they want to grow the pie, but they’re just as happy to take a bigger slice instead). But it does mean that they can act according to their indirect interests rather than direct ones.
>
> Financial markets ultimately help with this, because Facebook is valued highly relative to its sales. Every dollar of incremental sales for Facebook creates about $9 of market value, about $2.50 of which accrues to Mark Zuckerberg personally. And that value is based on Facebook’s long-term outlook; a high-multiple stock establishes a favorable exchange rate between the distant future and the immediate present, giving companies an incentive to make very long-term decisions even at the cost of short-term harms. Facebook, for example, noticed in 2018 that news stories led to vigorous discussion but fewer emotionally rewarding interactions, so they penalized those stories in their algorithm. This hurt their 2018 ad revenues, but benefited their 2030 active user counts, exactly the sort of tradeoff a controlling shareholder would prefer to make." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Idealists believe that every institution exists to build a better future for its participants. Cynics think every institution exists to perpetuate its own existence for the current benefit of whoever is in charge. The realist approach is to accept the cynical view as the ultimate asymptote to which all institutions trend, and to create incentives that align cynical self-preservation with prosocial behavior. Amazon employees who worked extra hours and took personal risk to keep delivering packages weren’t doing it to keep the economy afloat; they wanted bonuses, and they didn’t want to get fired. Facebook and Twitter didn’t send employees home out of pure altruism; they did it because operational disruptions are bad for business." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Technology companies responded fast because they’re in the habit of acting. Other institutions responded slowly, because they’re in the habit of reacting, and a novel infectious disease did not have a default institutional reaction. Ultimately, there’s a teleological difference between these institutions. Tech companies have a defined purpose, and they’re a vehicle for achieving that purpose. Google wants to organize the world’s information, and turning a gigantic profit while doing so is one of their operating constraints. SpaceX wants to make humans a multi-planetary species, and submitting competitive bids for rocket launches is an early step to accomplish this. But the U.S. government doesn’t have a defined purpose, just a long list of functions, and those functions aren’t regularly interrogated. It’s uncomfortable for modern Americans to ask what the ultimate goal of the government is... But an institution without an ultimate purpose is functionally dead. The only question is how long it takes for entropy to win." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

Based at University College London and founder of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, Mazzucato has spent her professional career on answering it. Her latest book on the topic is The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy, published in 2018.
>
> The book is a tour de force of economics, history, and policy. Such breadth is arguably necessary for Mazzucato’s fundamental goal: reopening the debate about economic value, what it includes, and who has the power to define it. What should count as real economic wealth? Who truly creates it, who merely assists the process, and who might be actively impeding it? The answers to that question have directed how economies develop, how governments direct or impede production, and what forms of economic power come to dominate human life.
>
> Once, the question of value dominated economic discourse. The French physiocrats argued that wealth was produced from the land. Conversely, Adam Smith tended to see landlords as a rentier class. Marx famously defined labor itself as the source of value. But this debate about value, once core to economic discourse, has long been de-emphasized in the discipline. As Mazzucato demonstrates, the marginal revolution in economics heralded a subjective, utility-focused approach that effectively sidestepped the historic debate about value—a sidestep that, in Mazzucato’s telling, drastically impoverished the discipline. An undergrad student today is likely to hear the above names once or twice in the opening lecture of an introductory course, and then only as a one-off primer. How did this happen?
>
> Following a historical primer on how the question of value was obscured, the book takes the reader through the successive results. Chief among these are the rise of financial power and its cannibalization of large parts of economic life, the extractive institutions in technological and medical innovation, and the gutting of a once-innovative and bold public sector, which had produced immense value across fields from consumer technology to medical products.
>
> Ultimately, Mazzucato exposes an orthodoxy of silence about value in modern economics, as well as in government. This orthodoxy, claims Mazzucato, has undermined public and private institutions and fundamentally weakened the ability of modern neoliberal economies to innovate." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "Smith also highlighted what he considered to be the great enemy of production: monopolistic power. Rentier landlords, mercantilist protectionism, and competition-stifling guilds were impediments to the market’s freedom. Unlike many who invoke him in the present, Smith saw government as playing a leading role in establishing what he defined as a ‘free market’: one free from rent-seeking monopoly power, not from government regulation." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "The notion that finance is part of the productive sphere at all is relatively new in the history of economic development. Aquinas and other medieval thinkers treated it with suspicion, Adam Smith more or less ignored it, and Marx treated it as part of capital’s “circulation phase.” Economists in the 20th century also critiqued it—Mazzucato notes Keynes and Minsky—but these warnings were not earth-shaking at a time when financial services were a very low share of national output. Interestingly, Mazzucato points out that Keynes prefigured modern concerns about finance’s brain drain of engineers and scientists with his quip that, rather than participating in a success story of laissez-faire capitalism, “the best brains of Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object.”
>
> ...
>
> Finance’s case is founded on the notion that it is a necessary part of spurring production by allocating capital. This is true, in a basic sense. Household savings don’t always cover costs, and business revenues don’t always cover investments. If finance merely pooled and directed resources to match these needs, it would not be a very exceptional industry. But in reality, finance does much more. Like other firms, banks are profit-driven. Rather than simple matchmaking, they act strategically to channel their revenues, especially into interest payments and toward shareholders. This logic fuels speculation bubbles, which are then continually refinanced through securitization and other strategies for inflating assets without investment." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

Roland Coase
The nature of the firm
higher trust because of reputation & accountability => easier to "hire" others
also onboarding is easier if everything is out in the open - including the best materials to onboard someone and get him up to speed + building coherence with others


> "Coase published a paper titled “The Nature of the Firm.” Not long before, Coase had made a visit to the United States during which he toured Ford and General Motors. The industrial behemoths left him puzzled. How, he wondered, could economists say that Stalin was mistaken to run the Soviet Union like one gigantic company when Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., ran their own gigantic companies in similar ways? After all, the marketplace is theoretically the best mechanism for matching supply with demand, establishing prices, and extracting maximum utility from finite resources. So why don’t all individuals act as individual buyers and sellers, rather than gather in companies with tens of thousands of coworkers?
>
> Coase argued that there were good reasons for the seemingly contradictory structure of the vertically integrated corporation. One of the main reasons has to do with the cost of information. Producing a loaf of bread, assembling a car, or running a hospital emergency room involve steps where close cooperation and common purpose are essential to producing a useful product. In day-to-day practice it was not practical to break down manufacturing and other business processes into a series of separately negotiated transactions. Each transaction would incur costs that would outweigh whatever savings were achieved by competitive pressures.
>
> First, there would be search costs, such as finding different suppliers and determining if their goods were appropriate. Second, there would be contracting costs, such as negotiating the price and contract conditions. Third, there would be coordination costs of meshing the different products and processes. Coase called these “transaction costs.” And the upshot was that most corporations concluded it made the most sense to perform as many functions as possible in-house.
>
> All this leads to what we and our colleagues call “Coase’s law”: A firm will tend to expand until the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market. As long as it is cheaper to perform a transaction inside your firm, keep it there. But if it is cheaper to go to the marketplace, do not try to do it internally.
>
> How has the Internet affected Coase’s law? Strictly speaking, the law remains as valid as ever. But the Internet has caused transaction costs to plunge so steeply that it has become much more useful to read Coase’s law, in effect, backward: Nowadays firms should shrink until the cost of performing a transaction internally no longer exceeds the cost of performing it externally. Transaction costs still exist, but now they’re often more onerous in corporations than in the marketplace.
>
> Take another look at Coase’s three kinds of collaboration costs. Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan had to physically seek out promising suppliers, inspect their factories, and haggle over prices. In most cases, the costs of sourcing external suppliers were so high that ownership of production processes across the automotive value chain was warranted, even if individual links were thereby shielded from market disciplines. Ford Motor’s infamous River Rouge plant, which drew raw rubber and steel into one end and pushed finished cars out the other, was the quintessential example of this. Today’s automotive firms type “axle” or “window glass” into any number of industry exchanges, and negotiate the price on the Web. If they want, they can check a supplier’s trustworthiness—just scan through the treasure trove of analytic services available online.
>
> How about contracting and coordination costs? Need steel from China, rubber from Malaysia, or glass from Wichita, Kansas? No problem. Online clearinghouses for each of these products enable purchasers to contract for price, quality, and delivery dates with a few clicks of a mouse. An executive can even track each shipment on a virtual map that shows its precise location at any point in the journey." - [Wikinomics - How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154341.Wikinomics)

> "Every economic system needs three things to function. First, the system needs information—it needs some way to coordinate people’s actions, to convey to people what they need to do in light of what others are doing. Second, it needs incentives—it needs some way to induce people to act on the information they receive. Third, because people make mistakes, it needs learning—a process by which people become better at responding to information and incentives.
>
> ... In economic theory, the “Socialist Calculation Problem” or “Knowledge Problem” holds that in large-scale societies it is close to impossible to make good economic calculations without market prices or a good substitute for market prices. Market prices are not, as non-economists commonly believe, arbitrary numbers set by capricious managers. They are instead a function of supply and demand. Market prices thus convey information about the relative scarcity of goods in light of the effective demand for those goods. Market prices, therefore, tell producers and consumers how to adjust their behavior to other people’s wants and needs.
>
> So, for instance, if more industries start trying to buy aluminum, the sellers of aluminum will try to raise their prices. When The Coca-Cola Company notices that the price of aluminum is rising, it will try to find a way to use less aluminum. In fact, soda cans use much less aluminum now than they did 40 years ago, but the cans have a better design that allows them to be stacked high despite containing less metal. This is not because executives at The Coca-Cola Company are environmentalists, but because they knew they’d make more profit if they could cut costs.
>
> Or, suppose there’s a power outage. You rush to the store for ice to keep your beer cold. But when you get to the store, you find the now scarce ice is selling for $12 a bag. You’ll probably decide it’s not worth buying ice for your beer. What you don’t realize, though, is that by choosing not to buy the ice, you thereby leave it for the diabetic who needs it to cool his insulin. As economics textbooks say, market prices tend to ensure goods go to their highest value uses.
>
> Consider a simple object—a number 2 pencil. You might not realize it, but literally millions of people worked together to produce that pencil, although only a few hundred of them realized they were doing so. The person who mines the iron that will go into the ball bearings in machines that grind up the graphite and clay that will end up on the pencil might have little idea that he is helping to make pencils. Yet market prices bring these millions of people together to produce pencils.
>
> Few people, aside from academic economists, understand what market prices are, how prices convey information, and how such prices coordinate billions of people to work together. But the magic of prices is that they help us work together even though we don’t understand what prices mean. People don’t need to understand how the market works in order for the market to work." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

The comedian Louis C. K. jokes in a Singerian spirit, “My life is really evil. There are people who are starving in the world, and I drive an Infiniti. That’s really evil…. There are people who are like born and then they go, ‘Oh, I’m hungry,’ and then they just die, and that’s all they ever got to do. And, meanwhile, I’m in my car—boom boom, brrr!—like having a great time, and I sleep like a baby…. I could trade my Infiniti for like a really good car, like a nice Ford Focus … and I’d get back like twenty thousand dollars, and I could save hundreds of people from dying of starvation with that money. And every day, I don’t do it.” See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC4FnfNKwUo

> "We must be careful not to equate socialism with moral virtue or community spirit. Capitalism and socialism are simply ways of organizing the ownership of property. In capitalism, individuals may own the means of production. In socialism, they may not—the means of production are owned collectively (or by the representative of the collective, such as the State). Socialism is not love or kindness or generosity or oceans of delicious lemonade. Socialism is not equality or community. It’s just a way of distributing the control rights over objects. Cohen asserts that capitalism runs on greed and fear. Yet Cohen cannot simply assert this as a conceptual claim. Capitalism is not analytically tied to greed and fear. Whether a regime is capitalist or not has nothing to do with people’s motives... A social system is capitalist to the extent that it has private property in the means of production, decisions about the use of property are made by owners rather than by governments or society at large, people may make contracts as they please, legal monopolies and subsidies are absent, and so on. So, if Cohen had said, “By ‘capitalism’, I just mean a predatory system of greed and fear,” that would be no stronger a condemnation of market societies than if Adam Smith said, “By ‘socialism’, I just mean a system of bloodthirsty dictators who starve and slaughter peasants.” We cannot just decide to insert evil motivations into the very definition of capitalism in order to argue that capitalism is evil.
>
> ... If one really wanted to know what motivates people in market society, one would do genuine social-scientific research. One might ask: In the real world, does capitalism encourage predation, greed, fear, poverty, power-grabbing, and other nasty behaviors more so than other kinds of economic systems? What sort of behaviors and attitudes does socialism encourage? These questions cannot be settled by conceptual analysis, stipulation, or imagining people on camping trips. The only way to answer these questions is to go and check, to conduct historical, sociological, and psychological research on what exposure to markets does to people, and what happens when markets are replaced by something else. If capitalism turns out to encourage bad behaviors and bad attitudes, it is to that extent bad. Yet, if it also turns out to do so less, in the real world, than the alternatives (such as socialism) do in the real world, then to that extent we have reason to favor capitalism in the real world. In fact, there are people conducting just this sort of research. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak says:
>
> 'Market exchange itself may lead to a society where individuals have stronger character values. The clearest evidence for this is the studies of fairness in small-scale societies conducted by Henrich and his colleagues. They showed that the likelihood of making fair offers to a stranger in one’s society is more strongly predicted by the extent of trade in markets than any other factor they have found. Exchange is inherently other-regarding — both you and I must benefit if exchange is to occur.'
>
> Zak says that, as far as the evidence we have goes, market societies induce people to play fair. Economists like to conduct experiments (using large amounts of real money) in which participants have the opportunity to cheat and swindle one another or to play fairly. Joseph Henrich and other researchers have tested a large number of variables to see which factors tend to make people play fair or cheat. Herb Gintis further summarizes these studies:
>
> 'Movements for religious and lifestyle tolerance, gender equality, and democracy have flourished and triumphed in societies governed by market exchange, and nowhere else. My colleagues and I found dramatic evidence of this positive relationship between markets and morality in our study of fairness in simple societies — hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, nomadic herders, and small-scale sedentary farmers — in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Twelve professional anthropologists and economists visited these societies and played standard ultimatum, public goods, and trust games with the locals. As in advanced industrial societies, members of all of these societies exhibited a considerable degree of moral motivation and a willingness to sacrifice monetary gain to achieve fairness and reciprocity, even in anonymous one-shot situations. More interesting for our purposes, we measured the degree of market exposure and cooperation in production for each society, and we found that the ones that regularly engage in market exchange with larger surrounding groups have more pronounced fairness motivations. The notion that the market economy makes people greedy, selfish, and amoral is simply fallacious.'
>
> As it turns out, the strongest cultural predictor that participants will play fairly with strangers is how market-oriented their society is. People from market societies characteristically know how to put themselves in their trading partner’s shoes. People from non-market societies do not. Other studies produce similar results. Zak and Stephen Knack have shown that market societies also tend to be high-trust societies, while non-market societies tend to be low-trust societies. Omar Al-Ubaydli and colleagues have shown that “priming” people with words related to markets and trade makes them more (not less!) trusting, trustworthy, and fair in experiments. Institutionalist economics often argues that market exchange does not rely upon self-interest alone. It also relies upon—and at the same time tends to reinforce—mutual trust, reciprocity, and trustworthiness. Market systems require a high degree of generalized trust and trustworthiness in order to function. Consider the fact that I could fly to Hong Kong, a city I have never visited, flash a credit card, and be supplied a luxury car, all on my promise to pay. Somehow, market societies make this promise mean something. To illustrate this further, every year the Fraser Institute, a free-market think tank located in Canada, ranks countries by how free market their economies are. Their top 10 in 2012 are Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Mauritius, Finland, and Chile. Denmark is ranked #16. The United States is ranked #18. Transparency International, ranked a non-government organization (NGO) focused on fighting political corruption, publishes a “Corruption Perceptions Index,” which ranks how corrupt countries are perceived to be. According to Transparency International, these are the top 10 least corrupt countries: Denmark, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, and Norway. You may notice quite a bit of overlap between the most economically free and the least corrupt countries. That’s not a coincidence. As Figure 3.1 shows, there is a positive correlation between countries’ degree of economic freedom (as measured by the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom ratings) and countries’ perceived lack of corruption (as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index). This kind of empirical work is not the final word. It does not decisively prove that market societies foster better motivations than socialist societies. However, it is better than hypothesizing from the armchair, as philosophers are apt to do. The only way to know whether capitalism is corrupting or ennobling is to do bona fide social-scientific research." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "PROPERTY RIGHTS: A BRIEF DESCRIPTION
>
> The distinctive features of capitalism are (1) extensive private property, especially in productive capital goods or the “means of production,” (2) voluntary trading of private property on the market, and (3) that every person possesses an extensive sphere of economic liberty in which she may make decisions as she pleases. Before moving on to explain why 1–3 would be valuable even in utopian conditions, I need to explain briefly just what private property is. When we say that Minnie Mouse owns the Bowtique, or that she has private property rights in her Bowtique, we mean that:
>
> 1. Minnie may use the Bowtique at will. That is, under normal circumstances, she can feel free to use it when she pleases and how she pleases, provided she respects the rights of others.
>
> 2. Minnie may alter or even destroy the Bowtique.
>
> 3. Minnie may sell, give away, rent, or otherwise transfer the Bowtique to others.
>
> 4. She may use the Bowtique to earn income.
>
> 5. Minnie may exclude others from using, changing, destroying, or interacting with the Bowtique. Others may not use the Bowtique without Minnie’s permission.
>
> 6. If others harm or destroy Minnie’s Bowtique, they owe her compensation.
>
> 7. Other people have a moral obligation to respect points 1–6; they are morally obligated not to interfere with Minnie as she uses, modifies, transfers, excludes, or destroys the Bowtique.
>
> So, a private property right is not really one unified right, but a bundle of related rights. Together, these rights give the owner a wide degree of control and discretion over an object, and, at the same time, exclude other people from exerting control over that object. Note that when we say that Minnie may use the Bowtique at will, we don’t mean that she may do just anything she wants with it. Our rights are always limited by other people’s rights. Consider: I have a right to free speech, but that right doesn’t imply that I am free to show up in your bedroom at 2 a.m. to recite the lyrics of “Raining Blood.” Similarly, Minnie has the right to use her bow-making equipment as she sees fit within a wide range of possible uses, but that doesn’t mean she can use it to murder other people. I have a right to own a guitar, but not the right to smash you in the face with it. Exactly how all of our rights fit together is a complicated philosophical question. I won’t expand on the point here, since there’s no special problem here for property rights as opposed to rights in general, and since the question of how rights fit together is reasonably well understood. Note also that property rights need not be considered absolute. They might instead be what philosophers call prima facie rights. The difference between an absolute right and a prima facie right concerns whether other moral considerations can ever trump or override these rights. Absolute rights right can never be trumped or overridden. But prima facie rights can be. So, for instance, my property right with respect to my lawn forbids you from running on my lawn without my permission. You may not choose to run around on my lawn just because you would enjoy doing so. However, suppose you were being chased by ravenous zombies and needed to cross my lawn to get away. If my property rights were absolute, it would be wrong for you to run across my lawn as you flee. However, if property rights are prima facie rights rather than absolute rights, then you may run across my lawn to get away. For reasons like this, philosophers tend to think property rights are prime facie rather than absolute. Note also that while ownership is a bundle of rights, we can own different things in different ways. Sometimes we own things, but this ownership doesn’t include all the particular rights listed above. For instance, Mickey owns a real dog, Pluto, while Donald owns a stuffed toy lion, Sparky. The way Mickey owns Pluto is different from how Donald owns Sparky. Donald may destroy Sparky at will, or slice Sparky up, or give Sparky to a person he knows will abuse him. But Mickey cannot do any of those things with Pluto, even though he owns Pluto. And so it goes with other things. Sometimes we own houses that come with restricted covenants, or pool club memberships we can sell only in confined ways. How we own things varies from thing to thing." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "PRIVATE PROPERTY IN UTOPIA
>
> ... The philosopher Loren Lomasky points out that people ... are project-pursuers. They have ideas and visions that they want to implement. Pursuing projects over the long term is often part (if not the only part) of what gives coherence and meaning to our lives. To express ourselves, develop ourselves, craft ourselves, and so on, often requires that we have sustained and exclusive control of objects over time. And so most people have an interest in controlling certain objects over time.
>
> If Minnie owns a bow factory, this means she may use it at will as she sees fit, but other people may not use it (modify it, destroy it, move it, etc.) without her permission. Minnie has a particular vision or set of goals she wants to achieve. She has projects she wants to engage in. To do so, she needs stuff, and she needs to be able to count on using that stuff in a sustained way over time. If the materials of her Bowtique were up for grabs—if just anyone could use them, even on a set schedule—she would not be able to pursue her vision of the good life. She needs the Bowtique to be at her disposal. The Bowtique is her creation, her vision, her project. Even though Minnie is happy to work with others on many other projects, it means something to her to control the Bowtique alone. She can count on being able to run her Bowtique as she pleases. Minnie takes a certain pride in having a bow factory that is hers, not because she’s fetishistic about consumption or control, but because this gives her an avenue to exercise her talents and achieve excellence in a long-standing project. Similar remarks apply to the other characters. Willie the Giant wants to farm. In an imaginary ideal socialist economy, the nice socialists would no doubt let Willie plow the collectively owned fields with the collectively owned plow. But that’s not good enough. Willie wants a farm that he can shape according to his vision. He wants the farm to be his, not because he’s selfish and mean, but because he wants to realize his own personal plans and ideas of how farming should go. For that to happen, he needs to have property that he can use at will and that others will refrain from using. It’s not just that Minnie, Donald, and Willie want exclusive use-rights over objects. They also want to be able to use, give-away, sell, and, in some cases, destroy these objects, as part of their pursuit of their visions of the good life. It means something for Minnie to be able to sell bows to others—that others are willing to buy from her because they like the bows rather than as a favor to her. It means something to Clarabelle that she can choose to sell her muffins or instead give them for free to a sick friend. And so on.
>
> Some philosophers—themselves having never owned a business—might have a hard time understanding these kinds of desires. But if that philosopher can understand why one might want to write a book by oneself, rather than with co-authors or by committee, the philosopher can similarly understand why someone might want to own a factory or a farm or a store. Or, if an artist can understand why one might want to paint by oneself, rather than having each brushstroke decided by committee, or rather than having to produce each painting collectively, then the artist can similarly understand why someone might want to own a factory or a farm or a store.
>
> Another closely related reason for having private property, even in utopia, has to do with the sheer aggravation of always having to ask permission. Imagine everything belonged to everybody. Now imagine everyone loves each other very much. Still, every time you go to use something, you’d have to check and see if anyone else needed or wanted to use it. (“Hey, does anyone need the laptop right now?”) Or, otherwise, we’d have to develop conventions such that you knew, without asking permission, that you could use particular things at certain times. (“Oh, good, it’s 6 p.m., now it’s my turn to use one of the village laptops.”) There’s something deeply annoying about both of those scenarios, even if we love others as much as we love ourselves. We want to have a range of objects that we can count on to be free to use at will, without first having to ask permission or to check with others or to follow a schedule. Without the right to make use of a range of objects at will, we will feel stifled and repressed.
>
> People have a need to feel “at home” in the world. Most of us feel “at home” in our homes because we may unilaterally shape our homes to reflect our preferences. Our homes are governed by the principles we endorse. We do not have to deliberate in public and justify our furniture arrangements to others in society. To the extent that we have private property, we acquire the means to carve out a space for ourselves in which we can be at home. That’s not to say that we cannot also feel at home in a collective. Mickey and Minnie enjoy communal activities and property just as much as they enjoy private activities and property. The important point is that most of us need both—we need at times to participate in a larger community, and we need at times to escape to our private ventures and spaces. Without private property, we cannot do the latter.
>
> Note further that, in pursuing our projects, it’s not just that sometimes I need access to an electric guitar or that Michelangelo needed access to paint. Rather, there’s an additional value to be gained from having access to the same electric guitar and the same paintbrushes over time. Over time, we incorporate objects in the world into our lives—they form part of our histories... We form relationships with some objects, with some of the things we own, with the books we write, with the artwork our children make us, and so on. This is not just a toy cheetah, but the very toy cheetah we joked like to eat monsters at night and so would keep my son safe from harm as he slept. This is not just a hammer, but the hammer my uncle used when he built his own house after the war. This is not just a Mustang, but the Mustang Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt (1968; dir. Pete James). And so on. And this is yet another reason why the Clubhouse Villagers have private property, even though they are so generous and kind that they could make do without it. They form relationships with particular objects and incorporate those objects into their lives.
>
> ... There is another reason for private property, when we try to practice utopia on a grand scale: The limits of our knowledge. We have imperfect information. Sure, in a small village, we might all know that the nice thing to do is let Minnie use the bow-making equipment whenever she wants. And so maybe there’d be little harm in saying that the equipment belongs to all, but we’ll just all choose to let Minnie possess it “as if” she had property rights in it. But in a large society, there’s just no way to scale this kind of thing up. I don’t know enough about other people, what their needs and desires are, or how different objects fit into their plans or projects. Related to this point, in previous work, Schmidtz and I have argued that private property is useful to help us form expectations:
>
> 'Consider, then, the point of property rights. In a way, such rights are like fences: their whole point is to get in the way. Or, if putting up fences does not sound liberating, consider a different metaphor: rights are like traffic lights. Traffic lights facilitate movement not so much by turning green as by turning red. Without traffic lights, we would all have, in effect, a green light, and the result would be gridlock. By contrast, a system where we face, in turn, red and green lights helps to keep us moving. The system constrains us, but we all gain in terms of our ability to get where we want to go; for we develop mutual expectations that enable us to do so uneventfully. Red lights can be frustrating, but the game they create for us is a positive-sum one. We all reach our destination more quickly, more safely, and more predictably, because we know what to expect from each other.'
>
> This is another instrumental defense of private property. But notice that this defense does not essentially rely upon the idea that private property is necessary to rescue us from problems arising from our moral failings. Here again the issue is cognitive, not moral. Adding to this, and staying with the traffic metaphor, consider the rules we use for four-way stops:
>
> 1. Whoever arrives first, gets to go first.
>
> 2. In the case of simultaneous arrival, whoever is on the right goes first.
>
> 3. If literally all four people arrive at the same time, resolve the conflict by waving.
>
> We also have a rule for emergencies:
>
> 4. Let the person with a known emergency go first!
>
> The fourth rule distributes the right of way according to need, while the other three do not. If the fourth rule—the need-based rule—trumps the others, why not just replace rules 1–4 with a new rule, 5?:
>
> 5. At any four-way stop, whoever has the most need gets to go first.
>
> In fact, there’s an obvious reason why not. Imagine what it would be like to live like that. We’d have to stop, get out of our cars, and have a conversation each time we come to a four-way stop. Even if we were all perfectly honest and good, this kind of rule would just be too costly. Distributing according to need is not what we need. This is not because we are morally flawed, but because we have cognitive limitations.
>
> Some socialists (although not, I think, Cohen) would object here that they have no problem with people owning personal, non-productive property, like toothbrushes or guitars they use in hobbies. They only have a problem with people owning productive property, like farm equipment or bow factories. But there are two big problems with this.
>
> First, it’s not clear there’s a deep distinction between productive and non-productive property. John Petrucci’s signature Music Man JP6 guitar is productive property he uses to earn a living; my Music Man JP6 guitar is non-productive property I use for fun. Eddie Van Halen uses his EVH 5150 III amplifier to earn a living; I use one for fun. Does this mean, from a socialist perspective, that it’s bad to let Petrucci have his guitars or Van Halen to own his amps, but fine for me to have them? Similarly, is it wrong for Hertz to rent cars to make money, but okay for you to own those exact same cars to drive yourself to work or your kids to soccer practice? Is it okay for Scrooge McDuck (in his DuckTales incarnation) to have his massive pile of money, so long as he uses it just for swimming and not as capital for investing? Is it okay for my aunt Jackie to own a loom as a decoration, but does it become wrong if she then starts making and selling fabric with it? For the most part, it seems like the difference between productive and nonproductive property is just how we use it. So, at most, socialists don’t really oppose allowing people to own private “productive property”; they oppose allowing people to use their private property in a productive way.
>
> Second, it’s not clear why, in ideal conditions, socialists would have any problem with people owning productive property. Socialists—such as many of the Occupy Wall Street protestors—object that allowing private ownership in the means of production leads to all sorts of problems—such as exploitation, treating people as instruments, objectionable inequality, a lack of opportunity, or whatnot—but these problems occur only under real-world conditions, not in utopian conditions. In the utopian conditions of Clubhouse capitalism, capitalist factory owner Minnie Mouse would never exploit anyone, because she is too nice. Capitalist Minnie Mouse would never allow objectionable inequalities or a lack of opportunity, because she and others like her would just choose to give the deserving poor what they need. And so on. Socialists’ moral objections to private property apply only in non-ideal, non-utopian conditions. They are irrelevant in this debate. In our world, we might all agree that Occupy Wall Street has some legitimate complaints, even if we do not all agree on their proposed solutions. But there is no Occupy (Main Street, U.S.A.?) movement in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse world, because none of the occupiers’ complaints apply to ideal capitalism.
>
> So, to summarize, there is a range of reasons to have private property, even in utopian conditions. People get value from having objects that they can use at will, without having to ask permission from others. They get value from being able to pursue projects, and to do so, they sometimes need objects over which they gain exclusive control. People have grounds for wanting to be able to pursue projects alone, rather than doing everything collectively. They find value in having spaces that are all their own, so that they can feel “at home” in those spaces. People can form sentimental attachments to particular objects that have a special history. And, finally, the most effective way of making sure people have the objects they need for their projects is often to follow the rules of private property, rather than treating everything as if it were a common pool to be distributed according to need. Sure, in utopia, we could make do without private property, but private property makes utopia better." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "MARKETS AND ECONOMIC LIBERTY IN UTOPIA
>
> We’ve established why, even under utopian conditions, people would get additional value from having private property. Now let’s discuss further why they would get value not just in having private property, but also in buying, selling, and trading this property in markets, and in having a wide sphere of economic liberty. A capitalist society endows each person with a wide sphere of economic freedom. Why would people in utopian conditions value having such a wide sphere? I’ll discuss two sets of reasons, one having to do with how markets help achieve prosperity, and one having to do with the goal of having people be the authors of their own lives.
>
> First, markets are important to ensure that people can be as prosperous as possible. Even in utopian conditions, market-societies will outperform socialist societies in economic terms. Some socialists might balk here that we should not be so focused on filthy lucre. But Cohen, I think, would disagree. Marxists say that real liberty is not just the absense of interference from others, but also the effective power, capacity, or ability to do what one wills. Call this conception of liberty positive liberty. For example, a bird has the positive liberty to fly, but human beings do not. Cohen once argued that “to have money is to have freedom.” He says that money, or more precisely, the real wealth that money represents, is like a ticket that gives people access to the world. The more wealth one has, the more one is able to do, and in that sense, the more freedom one has. If we care about people having positive liberty, then we care about making them as wealthy as we can. As the former paramount leader of communist China Deng Xiaoping is thought to have said, “To get rich is glorious!” I agree. In my ideal world, everyone who wants to be is a googolplexinaire.
>
> Now, keep in mind that trade is usually—and especially in utopian conditions—a positive-sum game. That is, when people are free to make trades and free to walk away from any trades they don’t want to make, then such trades will usually benefit both parties. In a market exchange—even in real-world capitalism—both parties to the trade make a profit. The difference between utopian and real-world capitalistic trading has to do with motivations. In the real world, we are fairly selfish, and so are less concerned with how well our trading partners do. In utopian capitalism, we are more strongly motivated to make sure the other party to the trade does well.
>
> In a class I teach on political economy, I illustrate the concept of gains from trade by doing an in-class experiment. As students enter, I give each of them a different candy bar. I ask them to rate the candy they received on a scale of 1–10, with 1 meaning they hate the candy and 10 meaning they love the candy. I then add up their scores. (For instance, in a fall 2013 seminar with 19 students, the total was 103.) After, I tell them they are free to make trades with any willing partner they wish. Most students make a trade, and everyone who trades is happier with her new candy than she was with the old. After all trading is ceased, I ask them to rate the candy they now have. Usually, the total value of the candy goes up 30–50%. (For instance, in the fall 2013 seminar, the final total was 149.) I then ask students, is there some way we could have made it possible to have even higher gains from trade? Usually, they conclude that if we had even more students trading a greater variety of candy bars (or even things other than candy bars), the gains would have been even higher. And so, in 10 minutes, the students discover first hand what Adam Smith explained in the first few pages of the Wealth of Nations (1981): the greater the size of the market, the greater the potential prosperity we can all enjoy.
>
> Economists have long understood that in a market economy, the systematic effect of private citizens’ pursuit of private ends is to create background conditions of wealth, opportunity, and cultural progress. Each of us does as well as we do because of the positive externalities created by an extended system of social cooperation. This extended system of cooperation explains why each of us in contemporary liberal societies have our high standards of living and easy access to culture, education, and social opportunities. We are engaged in networks of mutual benefit, and we benefit from other people being engaged in these networks. When we go to work in business, we help create, sustain, and improve these networks of mutual benefit. When things are going well—and overall they tend to go well—we create a series of positive externalities through our innovations, through the division of labor, and by helping to create economies of scale.
>
> This is all true of real-world markets. Would it be less true of markets in utopia, if utopia even has such markets? Keep in mind that in utopia, by definition, people are too nice to cause certain problems that occur in real-world markets. In utopian capitalism, you don’t have to worry about deception or “information asymmetries”—the mechanic never charges you for unnecessary work, and the used car salesperson always tells you the whole truth about the car. In utopian capitalism, you wouldn’t have to worry about exploitation—the buyer wouldn’t dare take advantage of your bad luck in order to offer you a low price. In utopia, no one tries to corner the market through monopolies or monopsonies. In utopia, everyone gladly contributes his or her fair share to public goods, knowing full well that everyone else will, too.
>
> Recall from Chapter One that all economic systems need information, incentives, and learning. By “information,” I mean that people need some signal that tells them how to coordinate their actions with others. By “incentives,” I mean that people need something that induces them to act on that information. And by “learning,” I mean that, since in the real world people respond imperfectly to information and incentives, we need something that trains people to respond better. In real-world conditions, socialism faces an incentive problem.
>
> In utopian conditions, socialism’s incentive problem disappears. However, the information problem remains. Thus, under utopian conditions, if people want to benefit from having a large-scale division of labor and being able to cooperate and work together with hundreds of thousands, millions, or billions of others, they will need to use markets.
>
> In real-world capitalism, we often make trades with people for whom we have only minor, diffuse concern. In utopia, however, everyone is motivated by a strong desire to promote the common good and the good of all. But this is a reason to use markets, not a reason to avoid them. In an ideal society, everyone is supposed to be motivated to promote the good of all, not just her own good. But, if so, then most people will be strongly motivated to participate in markets. If they want to coordinate their mutual activities to promote everyone’s good as best they can, the most effective way is through trade on the market. Market prices convey information about the relative scarcity of goods in light of the effective demand for those goods. Market prices thus tell producers and consumers how to adjust their behavior to scarcity and demand. When it comes to making maximal use of the information needed to run a large economy, nothing beats the market.

> To illustrate this, imagine that Mickey Mouse could have a magic wand that would make everyone 30 times’ richer over a period of 200 years. Mickey, being benevolent, would, of course, wave the wand.
>
> Now, suppose instead that Mickey Mouse could come up with an ideal economic plan, as old-fashioned socialists wanted. Imagine that Mickey Mouse is some kind of noble philosopher-king (or philosopher central-planner). He determines a way for us to work together, to divide up tasks, to cooperate, and so on, such that if we follow his plan, then over the next 200 years, we will all become 30 times’ richer. In utopian conditions, people would want to go along with Mickey’s plan voluntarily, because they would see that by going along with the plan, they promote the good of all. In utopian conditions, people would want to come together under Mickey’s guidance to produce such wonderful outcomes. (I’m sure Mickey would as best he can make provisions for ensuring that people get jobs and tasks that they enjoy, so that they all have good lives as they go along with his plan.) When everyone follows Mickey’s advice, it is kind of like waving the magic wand.
>
> The problem, of course, is that we don’t have any such magic wand, and Mickey Mouse just isn’t smart enough to come up with a functionally equivalent economic plan. Mickey is God-like in his moral character, but not in his brainpower. But the good news is that mainstream economics tells us that the market economy is, fundamentally, the same as the philosopher-king Mickey or the magic wand.12 While Mickey would have offered suggestions as part of his plan, the market instead offers prices, profits, and losses. And so, just as publicly spirited, benevolent people would want to go along with philosopher-king Mickey’s plan, they would want to participate in the market and respond to the signals the market sends. To follow the price signals of the market just would be to serve the common good of each and all.
>
> That’s not to say that everything in capitalist utopia will be done via for-profit business. Capitalist utopia would probably have a robust civil society, full of not-for-profit institutions and communal spaces, just as we see in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village. But it can benefit from having for-profit businesses, too. In fact, for large utopias of thousands of people or more, markets become imperative. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck can practice pure socialism on a small scale. Although they are nice enough to make it work on a large scale, they aren’t smart enough to make it work on a large scale.
>
> So, one reason to have markets in utopia is to ensure that people are prosperous and enjoy extensive positive liberty. But there is another reason as well. John Tomasi argues that people have an interest in being “self-authors,” that is, in choosing a conception of the good life and finding the means to achieve that conception. For most people, if not all, this means they need a wide sphere of liberty in which to make decisions in the economic realm. As Tomasi says, people are defined by the choices they make, by what they choose to do, and on what terms they choose to do it. Consider the following questions: Where should I work, and on what terms? How much should I consume, and how much should I save? How should I save? What should I consume? How will I decide among different possible goods and services? Is it more important to have a sports car or to take a family vacation? Should we add an addition to our house or send the children to camp for the summer? And so on. In a capitalist society, everyone is an economic planner. Everyone faces a constant stream of economic choices. How people respond to these choices both reflects and helps to determine just who they are as individuals. According to Tomasi:
>
> 'These are not mere details within a person’s life. The particular pattern of decisions one makes in response to these questions about working often goes a long way to defining what makes one person’s life distinct from the lives of other people. A society that denied individuals the right to make decisions regarding those aspects of their working experience would truncate the ability of those people to be responsible authors of their own lives. Indeed, denied these fuller freedoms …, citizens would no longer be authors of their own lives. Decisions about matters that affect them intimately would have been taken out of their hands and decided for them by others.'
>
> Many on the Left have a difficult time understanding why economic decisions could have such importance when it comes to people being responsible authors of their own lives. But, Tomasi says, these same people understand easily how our decisions about social, civil, and personal matters—about whom we will love, what god we will worship and how, whom we will associate with and on what terms, what hobbies we will pursue and to what degree, what books we will read and when, what music we will listen to and how loudly, what we will choose to learn and what we will ignore, and so on—shape who we are. Most people on the Left agree that if we want to allow people to be authors of their own lives, we need to grant them a wide sphere of liberty on these matters. Tomasi just says that if one can understand why it might be important to decide for oneself what and how much to read, one can similarly understand why it might be important to decide for oneself what and how much to save, invest, consume, and so on.
>
> Now, many on the Left want to reduce the sphere of economic liberty in the real world because they believe that granting people such an extensive sphere will lead to bad results. They worry that capitalists will exploit workers, that the rich will subvert democracy, that the poor will fall behind, or that the poor are too unconscientious to make rational decisions about how to spend and save. They are right, to some extent. But none of these worries apply to utopian capitalism. If we are playing by Cohen’s rules, if we are talking about what a just society would look like, then we are talking about a world where people are too good and just to do anything of these bad things." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "NOT JUST UTOPIA, BUT A FRAMEWORK FOR UTOPIAS
>
> So, which would you choose? Actually, that’s a trick question. The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village wouldn’t make you choose. And that’s one of the reasons why it’s morally superior. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village has a voluntaryist, anarchist, capitalist, libertarian structure. While it has some collective property, it is not a commune as a whole. Yet the Clubhouse Village would allow a commune within its borders. If, say, the Smurfs wanted to form a commune within the greater village, the other villagers would have no problem with that. Capitalism is tolerant. Want to have a worker-controlled firm? Go for it. Want to start a kibbutz or commune in which everything is collectively owned? No problem. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Villagers would allow Cohen to have his permanent socialist camping trip, so long as Cohen likewise lets Minnie Mouse have her Bowtique. There is an essential asymmetry in the capitalist and the socialist visions of utopia. Capitalists allow socialism, but socialists forbid capitalism. Capitalism permits people to own property individually, but it also permits them to own it collectively. In contrast, socialism forbids people from owning property individually, and only allows them to own it collectively. A capitalist utopia would allow people to form communes, but a socialist utopia would forbid Minnie from owning a factory by herself. Cohen thinks it’s best if everyone lives the socialist camping trip lifestyle. He would recruit everyone into the camping trip. He would, if he could, wave a magic wand that would make us all committed to communal life. He has one vision for utopia. It’s a fine vision, really, but there are other fine visions as well. The capitalist vision of utopia is bigger and broader than Cohen’s. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village is a libertarian, laissez-faire, market-society utopia, but allows non-libertarian, socialist utopias within its borders, so long as the inhabitants of these socialist utopias are there by choice rather than force. Capitalist utopia can contain socialist utopias within it. As Nozick argues in his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, capitalist utopia is not really one utopia, but many. It provides a “framework” in which many different utopias could co-exist in peace and mutual respect. This is crucial, because 'people are different. They differ in temperament, interests, intellectual ability, spiritual quests, and the kind of life they wish to lead. They diverge in values and they have different weightings for the values they share…. There is no reason to think that there is one community which will serve as an ideal for all people and much reason think that there is not.' ... Nozick notes that utopian writers have, with few exceptions, been so convinced of the beauty of their vision, that they have described utopia as being just one kind of community. But, Nozick says, it’s more plausible that utopia is not all one thing. Instead, utopia is a collection of utopias: many different kinds of communities with many different kinds of people. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village could be not just a utopia, but a meta-utopia in which you may choose the utopia that’s best for you. The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village is utopia not simply because it offers a beautiful vision of its own, but also because it allows other utopias to flourish within its borders. It leaves everyone free to create or inhabit the utopia of her choice with others who also choose to live there. It offers a framework in which inhabitants of one utopia can take joy in co-existing and contemplating the lifestyles of the inhabitants of other utopias.17 The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse gives you everything Cohen’s socialist camping trip gives you, and then gives you even more. If Cohen has given us a portrait of utopia, Nozick has given us an art gallery. If Cohen’s socialist utopia is the Mona Lisa, Nozick’s capitalist utopia is the entire contents of the Louvre. The slogan of capitalist utopia might be something like, “Let a hundred flowers blossom.”

> CONCLUSION
>
> Cohen says our theories of justice should be about what’s best, period, not about what’s best given how selfish and nasty people are. Justice is the thing that happens in a world where people have morally perfect motivations and always do whatever morality requires of them. In that kind of world, the problems of real-life socialism disappear. And so, Cohen claims, socialism becomes a desirable way to live. He’s right. But in that kind of world, the problems of real-life capitalism disappear as well, while many of its virtues remain. And that makes all the difference. Socialists are forever offering us an inferior product. Ideal capitalism is better than ideal socialism, and realistic capitalism (of some sort) is better than realistic socialism. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse shows us, to our great surprise, that when we judge systems by Marxist philosophical standards, capitalism becomes the most intrinsically desirable way to live. And, surprisingly, one reason Clubhouse Capitalism becomes the most desirable way to live is that for some small percentage of us, socialism is the most desirable way to live. In the real world, capitalism encourages entrepreneurs to provide you with the things you want at prices you can afford to pay. In the ideal world, capitalism does even better: it gives you the opportunity to live in your personal utopia." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

Evolution can perform its tricks not just in the “substrate” of DNA, but in any system that has the right information-processing and information-storage characteristics. In short, evolution’s simple recipe of “differentiate, select, and amplify” is a type of computer program—a program for creating novelty, knowledge, and growth. Because evolution is a form of information processing, it can do its order-creating work in realms ranging from computer software to the mind, to human culture, and to the economy... Our intentionality, rationality, and creativity do matter as a driving force in the economy, but they matter as part of a larger evolutionary process.

As mentioned before, the role of prediction in science is to help us distinguish between competing explanations. A well-formulated theory will have logical implications that can be tested... Science is a continuous learning process in which the logical implications of competing explanations are tested and a body of evidence is accumulated over time. As Sir Karl Popper showed in the 1930s, there is no “final proof” that a theory is correct, but one can say whether a theory is disproved by data, whether one theory fits the data better than another, and whether a theory has yet to be contradicted by data. For example, one cannot say that Einstein’s theory of relativity has been proven, but one can say that its predictions have been well tested, it has yet to be contradicted, and it fits the data better than any alternative explanation proposed thus far. Science thus goes through a process of proposing various explanations, rigorously articulating them in ways that can be tested, eliminating theories that fail the tests, and building on the ones that succeed." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "Kauffman argues that an effective way to increase adaptability and avoid conflicting constraints is to break things up. Organizing the network into hierarchies reduces the density of connections and thus reduces the interdependencies in the network. Hierarchies are critical in enabling networks to reach larger sizes before diseconomies of scale set in. This is why so many networks in the natural and computer worlds are structured as networks within networks. In an organizational context, the conventional wisdom is that hierarchy is a feature of bureaucracy that reduces adaptability. Managers are told that they should de-layer and flatten their organizations. But counterintuitively, hierarchy can serve to increase adaptability by reducing interdependencies and enabling an organization to reach a larger size before gridlock sets in... Hierarchy does, of course, have its problems; for example, information can degrade as it travels up the chain, the top may become out of touch with the front line, and a poor performer in a senior role can do a lot of damage. But just assuming that hierarchy is inherently bad is simplistic and misses its crucial role as an interdependency breaker." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

Deductive scientific theories did not completely replace tinkering; any engineer will tell you that what works in theory does not always work in practice. But the balance was tipped toward a very potent combination of the two, thereby dramatically increasing the speed with which evolution could find high peaks in the PT landscape. Technology evolution is not a mere metaphor. It is the result of humankind’s deductive-tinkering search through the near-infinite possibilities of Physical Technology space. The nature of the process of differentiation, selection, and replication in this substrate is different from that of biology, but it is an evolutionary process nonetheless.

On the flip side, no countries with poor Social Technologies performed well, no matter how well endowed they were with resources or how disciplined their macroeconomic policies were.

Social Technologies include all the elements necessary for organizing.

> ... In his thought-provoking book, Non Zero, the journalist and science writer Robert Wright argues that much of human history can be viewed as the outcome of this central tension between cooperation and self-interest. Wright claims that the process of bootstrapping social complexity, from simple hunter-gatherer tribes to organized villages to nation-states and global corporations, has been the result of humans innovating new ways to cooperate across larger and larger scales and devising ways to play increasingly complex and profitable non-zero-sum games. He notes that in a world where resources are finite at any given moment, there are competitive pressures to cooperate. Over time, societies that are better able to organize themselves will socially, economically, and militarily dominate societies that are less successful at creating cooperative structures. Thus, it is the competition to cooperate that drives social innovation.
>
> Recasting Wright’s thesis in the language we have developed, we can view the deductive-tinkering search through the ST fitness landscape as a quest for STs that enable people to play and capture the benefits of non-zero-sum games. Social Technology fitness will therefore depend on three factors. First, the ST must provide the potential for non-zero-sum payoffs. Second, it must provide methods for allocating the payoffs in such a way that people have an incentive to play the game. And third, the ST must have mechanisms for managing the problem of defection. Let’s take a closer look at each factor.
>
> Non-Zero Magic
>
> There are four basic sources of 1 + 1 = 3 magic in non-zero-sum games. All four have been well known to Traditional Economic theory for a long time. First is the division of labor... Second is the heterogeneity of people. Their different needs and tastes create opportunities to trade for mutual benefit... Third are the benefits of increasing returns to scale... Fourth, and finally, cooperation helps smooth out uncertainties over time...
>
> Dividing the Spoils
>
> These four sources of non-zero-sum gains can be mixed and matched in various contexts to create a near-infinite number of ways that people can cooperate for their mutual benefit. But for people to have an incentive to cooperate, they must receive some share of the spoils. How the gains of cooperation are divided up is therefore a crucial question. If the rewards are distributed in the wrong way, then cooperation collapses and the non-zero-sum gains evaporate. Allocating the payoffs from cooperation is where John Nash (profiled in the popular book and film A Beautiful Mind) first made his mark with a brilliant paper in 1950 titled “The Bargaining Problem.”15 In the paper, Nash asked the simple question, how will two bargainers come to agreement? How much meat will Harry give Larry for the hand ax? As simple as it sounds, the problem stumped economists for generations. Nash’s elegant solution was to say that how two or more bargainers split up the gains from exchange depends on how much each values the benefits of the deal, and what the parties’ alternatives are. Each looks for his or her best deal assuming everyone else is looking for the best deal, too, and the trade is made at the point at which no one has any incentive to change position, given the actions of the other. This point became known as the Nash equilibrium. Thus, as Harry and Larry haggle over the ax, they eventually find a point at which both are happy to trade and neither can improve his position without blowing the deal—they make the trade. Both walk away better off than they would have been had they not traded at all, thus capturing the non-zero-sum gains of cooperation. But the existence of a Nash equilibrium does not guarantee a happy, cooperative result. In the single-round Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is the solution in which both prisoners rat on each other and go to jail. This is because, if you are one of the prisoners and you don’t know whether your colleague will talk or stay silent, you are better off talking. As your colleague in crime faces the same incentives, you can assume that he will talk, too. Nash’s theorem tells us that for non-zero-sum games to result in cooperation, either the payoffs need to be structured such that everyone’s best response is to cooperate, or the players need some mechanism for coordinating their responses. For example, let’s say the prisoners have a mafia boss who promises to kill anyone who testifies and to reward anyone who keeps quiet after being released from jail. That would change the payoff structure and move the Nash equilibrium to a point at which both clam up and go free. Likewise, if the prisoners were allowed to communicate and knew what the other had been offered, they could coordinate their responses and avoid the defection trap. This last solution, however, would still have the possibility that one prisoner could nevertheless sell out the other for gain; after all, there is no honor among thieves. This leads to our third critical factor in ST fitness; for STs to be fit, they must have mechanisms for dealing with those who don’t play nice.
>
> Cheaters (Mostly) Never Win and Winners (Mostly) Never Cheat
>
> The incentive to cheat means that cooperation is inherently difficult to achieve and potentially unstable even once attained... The selfish logic of biological evolution says that if cheaters cheat and get away with it, they improve their chances of passing their cheating genes onto their offspring. Thus, cheating confers an evolutionary advantage. But if biological selection gives cheating genes an advantage over sucker genes, how, then, does cooperation get a foothold in a population? The answer is that the gains from cooperation are so powerful that cooperating genes have an advantage over cheating genes—but only if the genes aren’t naive, don’t let themselves be suckers, and ensure that cheaters get punished. To survive, cooperating genes need some sophisticated defense mechanisms. Recall our earlier discussion of Kristian Lindgren’s model. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, if the players play for just one round, both players have an incentive to rat on each other. When the game is repeated, however, and no one knows when it will end, the dynamics become much more complex. The types of robust, successful strategies that evolve usually have a logic along the lines of this: “I will begin on the assumption of mutual cooperation. If you cheat on me, however, not only will I refuse to cooperate, but I will punish you, even to my own near-term detriment. After some time, though, I might forgive you and try cooperating again, just in case your cheating was an error or a miscommunication, or on the chance you have reformed your ways. If, however, you cheat again, the probability of my forgiving you again will become lower and my punishment even more terrible.” Just as evolution produced this kind of logic in the world of Lindgren’s computer model, so too did evolution produce this kind of logic in the minds and instincts of our ancestors. Earlier in the book, we discussed a series of experiments called the ultimatum game in which researchers gave two subjects a pool of money and asked one person to decide on how to split it, and if the other agreed the split was fair, each could keep his or her share. If the partner rejected the split, however, neither got any money. The results of these reciprocity experiments were striking. Economic logic says that people should accept any offer of a split, no matter how small, because some money is always better than no money. In test after test, however, subjects rejected offers that were perceived as unfair, even to their own detriment. The results were consistent across cultures around the world, including hunter-gatherer cultures. Other games and experiments confirm the consistent and deep-rooted nature of human cooperative-reciprocity behavior. Evolution has steered us in a direction whereby we are naturally inclined to be cooperative to capture the riches of non-zero-sum gains. Nevertheless, it has also equipped us with a sensitivity to cheating, expectations of fairness, and a willingness to mete out punishment to those we believe have crossed the line. In effect, evolution has programmed into our mental software sophisticated, intuitive “Nash equilibrium finders” and “fairness detectors” that enable groups of humans to form coalitions that are at least reasonably stable and resistant to attack by free riders and cheaters. Our reciprocity software, however, is not hardwired—it can adapt to local circumstances. When we are in an environment in which most of our experience is of other people’s cooperation and reciprocation and in which social norms give us signals that people can be trusted (e.g., people tell admiring stories about self-sacrificing, trustworthy types), then our mental cooperation software will tend to be biased toward cooperating. It also will be more surprised and more forgiving when it encounters an example of defection or cheating. In essence, our minds statistically sample the population around us, and if people are usually cooperative, then when we encounter a cheater, we will tend to assume that the person’s behavior is probably the result of an error or misunderstanding. In contrast, in a low-cooperation, high-cheating environment with social norms that don’t support cooperation (e.g., the stories are all about thieves, and people tell you to “watch your back”), our cognitive cooperation software biases us toward being suspicious. We react harshly to the first signs of cheating, forgive only slowly if at all, and are likely to resist cooperating until given a sign of cooperation from the other party first. The local tuning of reciprocity norms can create very complex dynamics at the level of populations. High-cooperation societies can see collapses in cooperation if cheating reaches a critical mass; low-cooperation societies can get stuck in uncooperative, economically impoverished dead ends; and when people from different cooperative traditions mix, it can lead to misunderstanding and turmoil... Thus, Social Technologies that are better at tapping into sources of nonzero-sum gains, finding cooperative Nash equilibriums for allocating those gains, and managing the defection problem will be higher on the fitness landscape than those that do not. As people have deductively tinkered their way across the landscape in search of fit STs, humankind has evolved increasingly complex and sophisticated social structures for addressing these three issues.
>
> ... From the biological heritage of our primate origins, we inherited an inclination to cooperate for mutual gain and a compulsion to compete in dominance hierarchies, and eventually our developing human brains gave us language. From these humble beginnings sprang an evolutionary process of deductive-tinkering over tens of thousands of years as humans experimented with various ways of organizing their social and economic activities. The inherent non-zero-sum riches found in cooperation rewarded those STs that worked, and over time, humankind found increasingly effective Good Tricks for organizational success. As our species evolved its way through the rough-correlated landscape of ST design space, people were able to build on the tricks that worked, with each successful innovation yielding the possibility of even more future possibilities. As such innovations improved the ability of organizations to process information and solve problems, richer and richer areas of the ST fitness landscape were opened up. Simultaneously, ST space coevolved with Physical Technology space as discoveries in each sphere fed new possibilities in the other." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

A firm is one or more businesses controlled in common by a person or group of people... What are the units of selection in economic evolution? Given that units of selection are sections of schemata, they must be bits of Business Plans. But which bits? How would we recognize them? And at what level of granularity? Is a unit of selection, for example, a marketing strategy, or might it be the Physical Technology for a particular product?... It sounds a bit circular to say that the units of selection are whatever the environment is selecting for (and against). But we have no choice; fitness functions are highly complex, multidimensional, and change over time. One cannot say a priori what the system is selecting for; one can only observe selection retrospectively, and thus only take an empirical, backward-looking approach to defining units of selection... Thus, a “gene” is merely a convenient label for bits of schemata scattered along the DNA and involved in coding for a heritable trait that could provide some basis for differential survival and reproduction. We will take a similarly pragmatic and empirical approach in identifying the units of selection in economic evolution and define a new term, a module, as follows: 'A module is a component of a Business Plan that has provided in the past, or could provide in the future, a basis for differential selection between businesses in a competitive environment.'

In a market-based economy, a business lives or dies by whether its customers like and are willing to pay for its products and services. In a Big Man economy, resources are directed toward the ventures that best line the pockets of the Big Men. In a market economy, resources are directed to ventures that make the best economic use of them. All economies throughout history have in truth been some mixture of Big Men and markets. People in our hunter-gatherer past were often free to trade with each other as long as it didn’t displease the Big Man, and assuming he got his cut... For the vast bulk of human history, though, Big Men have dominated Business Plan selection, and markets have played either a secondary or an underground role... Market economies are systems of evolutionarily competing hierarchies... Recalling the biological maxim “good replicators replicate,” one can take a “module’s eye” view in the economic world and see that “good amplifiers amplify. Thus, we can see a variety of mechanisms at work for transmitting and amplifying Business Plan modules. They include the mental simulation and decision making of a single person, the problem solving and decision making of a group, imitation within and outside an organization, the direction of resources toward successful modules by the market, and the takeover of one business by another.
>
> ... Traditional Economics emphasizes that markets are the best method for allocating resources in a way that optimizes the welfare of society under equilibrium conditions. The problem, as we have seen, is that in the real world, equilibrium conditions are never met. But if the equilibrium assumptions of Traditional Economics are wrong, how can we be sure markets are a good thing? Following the framework I have just outlined, we can reinterpret markets as an evolutionary search mechanism. Markets provide incentives for the deductive-tinkering process of differentiation. They then critically provide a fitness function and selection process that represents the broad needs of the population (and not just the needs of a few Big Men). Finally, they provide a means of shifting resources toward fit modules and away from unfit ones, thus amplifying the fit modules’ influence.” In short, the reason that markets work so well comes down to what evolutionary theorists refer to as Orgel’s Second Rule (named after biochemist Leslie Orgel), which says, “Evolution is cleverer than you are.” Even a highly rational, intelligent, benevolent Big Man would not be able to beat an evolutionary algorithm in finding peaks in the economic fitness landscape. Markets win over command and control, not because of their efficiency at resource allocation in equilibrium, but because of their effectiveness at innovation in disequilibrium. Complexity economists don’t ignore the allocative role of markets. They tend to think markets are pretty good at that, too, and generally better than the Big Man alternative. But while Traditional economists like to talk about the “perfect efficiency” of markets in equilibrium, Complexity economists often view market efficiency as a more relative notion. The Complexity view is that an ideal state of perfect efficiency may not actually exist, and even if it did, the disequilibrium nature of markets would probably prevent it from ever being reached. Markets can never be perfectly efficient, just as the engine of a car can never be made 100 percent thermodynamically efficient. The reason that markets are good at allocation has more to do with their computational efficiency as a distributed processing system (i.e., they get the right signals to the right people), than with their ability to reach a mythical global equilibrium. The empirical record of markets points to their success as an evolutionary mechanism. As the economist William Baumol has said, free markets have historically been “innovation machines.”

> ... a set of innovations in Social Technologies significantly boosted the clock-speed of economic evolution itself. In chapter 11, we discussed the first meta-innovation, the scientific revolution. Prior to 1500, human knowledge was primarily built by trial and error. The advent of science accelerated the pace of human search through Physical Technology space and vastly increased the effectiveness of both rational deduction and experimental tinkering. The second meta-innovation was the rise of organized markets. The development of market-based economies did not occur in a big bang, but rather was the result of two centuries of ST evolution. Two key events that initiated this change were the creation of parliamentary democracy in England, and the American Revolution." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "Economic wealth and biological wealth are thermodynamically the same sort of phenomena, and not just metaphorically. Both are systems of locally low entropy, patterns of order that evolved over time under the constraint of fitness functions. Both are forms of fit order. And the fitness function of the economy—our tastes and preferences—is fundamentally linked to the fitness function of the biological world—the replication of genes. The economy is ultimately a genetic replication strategy... If wealth is indeed fit order, then we can use another more familiar word to describe it. In physics, order is the same thing as information, and thus we can also think of wealth as fit information; in other words, knowledge. Information on its own can be worthless. Knowledge on the other hand is information that is useful, that we can do something with, that is fit for some purpose. So we have come full circle; the founder of Traditional growth theory, Robert Solow, was right. The origin of wealth is knowledge. Yet rather than treating knowledge as an assumption, an exogenous input, a mysterious process outside the bounds of economics, the Complexity-based view I have outlined puts the creation of knowledge at the endogenous heart of the economy. Evolution is a knowledge-creation machine—a learning algorithm... The sheer volume of knowledge in the econosphere is as staggering as that in the biosphere. The econosphere, too, was created by differentiate, select, amplify, and repeat. We have found the answer to our quest. Wealth is knowledge and its origin is evolution." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)

> "We may not be able to predict or direct economic evolution, but we can design our institutions and societies to be better or worse evolvers... The message of Complexity Economics is that evolution may indeed be cleverer than we are, but rather than outsmart it, we can understand it and harness its power to serve human purposes... In evolutionary systems, sustainable competitive advantage does not exist; there is only a never-ending race to create new sources of temporary advantage... Companies Don’t Innovate; Markets Do... Markets are highly dynamic, but the vast majority of companies are not... Companies are Big Man (today we should say, Big Person) hierarchies with all their human foibles and distortions, while markets are almost pure evolutionary machines. Companies have an inherent disadvantage in that they can never have the same diversity of Business Plans as contained in the market as a whole. Nor can they ever perfectly mirror the selection pressures of actual markets or have the nearly infinite resources of the capital markets to invest in amplifying and scaling up Business Plans that succeed... Strategy is about making long-term commitments that will result in competitive advantage. But we can’t predict the future very well due to the contingencies of frozen accidents. Furthermore, competitive advantage is rare, temporary, and appears to be lasting ever-shorter amounts of time. Finally, evidence shows that the vast majority of companies are poor runners in the Red Queen race and unable to keep up with the pace of adaptation in their markets. The question then is, can we do better? Can we design companies that are more adaptable than those we have today? And specifically, can we avoid the problem of prediction and develop a more robust and adaptable approach to strategy?

> Strategy as a Portfolio of Experiments
>
> The key to doing better is to “bring evolution inside” and get the wheels of differentiation, selection, and amplification spinning within a company’s four walls. Rather than thinking of strategy as a single plan built on predictions of the future, we should think of strategy as a portfolio of experiments, a population of competing Business Plans that evolves over time... There are some general lessons that can be learned from a portfolio-of-experiments approach to strategy. First, management needs to create a context for strategy. Constructing a portfolio of experiments requires a collective understanding of the current situation and shared aspirations among the management team. Second, management needs a process for differentiating Business Plans that results in a portfolio of diverse Plans. Third, the organization needs to create a selection environment that mirrors the environment in the market. Fourth and finally, processes need to be established that enable the amplification of successful Business Plans and the elimination of unsuccessful Plans.
>
> ... Instead of taking big, risky bets to innovate, take many small ones and only bet big on stuff that works. Pursuing multiple Business Plans at the same time does not necessarily mean ambiguity if there is clarity in the selection pressures for good plans and bad plans. And while senior executives cannot necessarily control the outcomes of their strategic experiments, they can control the process of creating, selecting, and amplifying experiments to increase their odds of success. In many ways, an adaptive mind-set is the opposite of what is conventionally considered a visionary approach. An adaptive mind-set is highly pragmatic. It values tangible facts about today more than guesses about tomorrow, doesn’t expect that everything will work out as planned, and prefers lots of small failures to big ones. Above all, an adaptive mind-set is willing to say, “We learned something new; we need to change course.”" - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "CHAPTER 16: Organization
>
> ... We will define a social architecture as having three components: • The behaviors of the individual people in the organization. • The structures and processes that align people and resources in pursuit of an organization’s goals. • The culture that emerges from the interactions of people in the organization with each other and their environment... we will use a definition from Howard Aldrich, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina: 'Organizations are goal directed, boundary-maintaining, and socially constructed systems of human activity.'
>
> ... In short, Coase said, if it is cheaper to freelance, people will freelance, but if it is cheaper to pull people together into an organization, they will. We can update Coase’s idea for our evolutionary framework and say that not only might organizations be cheaper mechanisms for cooperation in some circumstances, but they might also enable people to reach parts of Business Plan design space unobtainable just by contracting. In short, organizations are better vehicles for exploiting Business Plan space and thus better vehicles for wealth creation. There are four reasons for this.
>
> First is a problem that economists refer to as incomplete contracts. No matter how clever the lawyers are, no contract can ever cover all possible contingencies; life is simply too complex. The more complex the cooperation required, the more likely the contract will be incomplete. The problem of incomplete contracts restricts freelancing to relatively simple parts of Business Plan space.
>
> Second is a factor economists call the holdup problem. As discussed, wealth creation requires hard-to-reverse commitments. Often, those commitments take the form of investments in specific assets. As the name implies, such assets are designed to do something specific for a production process, but are not much use for other purposes. For example, a pizza oven is terrific at baking pizzas, but not very useful for cooking other things. The problem of incomplete contracts means that in a group of freelancers, there is always a risk that the contracts will unravel and someone will be stuck with expensive and hard-to-sell specific assets. The other freelancers can then “hold up” the owner of the assets and threaten to quit unless they get a better deal. By creating shared ownership of assets and aligning the interests of participants, organizations reduce the risk of investing in specific assets and making hard-to-reverse commitments.
>
> Third, organizations provide a structure for cooperation to endure over long periods, even as the specific agents involved change. Some projects take many years to complete—for example, discovering, testing, and producing a new drug can take a decade or more. Yet individual human beings do inconvenient things like quit, get fired, move to another company, get sick, or even die. If GlaxoSmithKline had to disband and restart every time someone left the company, it would not get much done. By creating cooperative structures that outlive the participation of individual agents, organizations again enable us to reach for much more complex Business Plans than we could obtain in a purely freelance economy.
>
> Fourth and finally, organizations provide a vehicle for collective learning... stigmergy... We cooperatively create artifacts that contain embedded information, and we change our behavior in response to the information embedded in those artifacts... Organizations are full of documents, diagrams, computers, and other physical artifacts that enable stimergistic learning, despite a changing cast of agents. Following our framework from part 3, organizations thus play the critical role of providing a storehouse, or a collective memory, for schemata.
>
> ... “exploration” and “exploitation.” ... it is no coincidence that this yin-yang theme of opposing challenges keeps cropping up. But as we saw in the previous chapter, the evidence suggests that companies are generally better at the executing half of the dialectic than the adapting half. Some might argue that this is just the natural order of things, that economic evolution is best handled at the market level and organizations should merely be execution machines. Let markets explore and firms exploit. But there is an argument to be made that greater intracompany adaptation would be better for society. Adaptation reduces the frictional losses associated with company failures and unemployment. When a company fails to adapt, the intransigence can have tragic consequences for individual lives and local communities. In addition, the lack of organizational adaptability is not strictly a concern of businesses. Many other types of organizations, ranging from nonprofits, to governments and military bodies, suffer from the same issue. Now that we have a perspective on what organizations are and why they exist, we can begin to examine why their performance on the executing side versus the adapting side of the equation is so heavily weighted toward execution. Using the perspective that organizations are complex adaptive systems, we will examine them from three levels: ...
>
> Individuals: Through Rose-Colored Glasses
>
> How well an organization adapts is partly a function of the adaptability of the minds of the individuals in it. This is a question not only of the minds at the top, but also of the minds up and down the hierarchy... We will look at four reasons for poor individual adaptability: First, people have a bias toward overoptimism, which can reduce the felt need for change. Second, people also have a natural bias toward loss aversion, making them less likely to take certain kinds of risks. Third, the way we categorize the world and structure our mental models can get in the way of change. And fourth, the punctuated-equilibrium nature of change tends to favor leadership styles that are more rigid than ones that are more flexible. To begin changing their mental models, people must first perceive a need to change. They must see a gap between their goals and the current state and trajectory of the world. Moreover, fundamental change often requires that people believe something bad will happen unless things change... As Lovallo and Kahneman note: “The bearers of bad news tend to become pariahs, shunned and ignored by other employees. When pessimistic opinions are suppressed, while optimistic ones are rewarded, an organization’s ability to think critically is undermined. The optimistic biases of individual employees become mutually reinforcing, and unrealistic views of the future are validated by the group.” This means that one is likely to find a greater proportion of optimists as one gets nearer the top of the organizational ladder. This then creates a barrier to adaptability because the optimists feel a less acute need to change than do realists...
>
> Individuals: Adaptability and Loss Aversion
>
> ... This general bias toward loss aversion naturally makes companies more cautious in exploring and more focused on exploiting. Exploring is by definition a more uncertain activity, and more fraught with downside risk. But there is a more subtle effect as well. In judging risk, people tend to look at relative scale rather than absolute scale. A CEO might view a $100 million decision as a big bet and be loss averse, but view a $1 million decision as small potatoes and be much less loss averse. A midlevel manager, however, might view the $1 million decision with the same trepidation as that felt by the CEO over the $100 million bet. This means that both decisions might be treated with the same level of risk aversion. Yet logically, the organization should be far more risk averse toward the $100 million bet. But the punishment for the middle manager (e.g., getting fired) for blowing a $1 million bet is personally just as negative as the pain for the CEO on losing his or her $100 million bet—in fact, the CEO, strapped into a golden parachute, might actually have a softer fall. As Kahneman points out, this gamblers’ relativism means that organizations are often too risk averse for small bets made at lower levels of the hierarchy, and insufficiently risk averse for large bets made at the top levels... When companies deny themselves a portfolio of small risks, they get strategically boxed in and end up placing all their chips on big-bet investments and on mergers and acquisitions...
>
> Individuals: The Price of Experience
>
> In chapter 6, we discussed how the cognitive scientist John Holland and his colleagues portray human mental models as organized into “default hierarchies.” Concepts are grouped together in hierarchical structures (e.g., small, blue, buzzing things are categorized as “flies”), and our decision-action rules use specific information when we have it, but fall back on default rules when things are uncertain. The structure of a default hierarchy has a great benefit in that it allows people to take action even when they don’t have complete information. And it allows people to fine-tune their actions and learn as they get more specific information and experience. On the down side, this structure can make experience a double-edged sword.29 When we are young and inexperienced, our default hierarchies are fairly shallow, so our views of the world are more general than specific. This way of thinking has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that our mental models are easily changeable. New experiences are readily absorbed, and reorganizing the hierarchy is not very difficult, because there isn’t that much to reorganize. The disadvantage is that there is a lower probability of having the right response to a given situation... As we gain experience with age, our default hierarchies fill up and the situation reverses. We have a larger collection of specific experiences and more feedback on what has worked and what has not. Our mental models grow into highly complex structures of categories, interlinked rules, and weightings. We become less likely to perceive anything as totally new, and instead try to relate new knowledge to previous experiences and group those experiences into existing categories. Once in a while, we encounter something outside our realm of experience, and we then have to create a new, high-level category or rearrange existing categories. As our mental models become more complex, such major rearrangements become more difficult. Reorganizing an older, more experienced mental model is like reorganizing General Motors, whereas reorganizing a younger, less experienced model is more akin to reorganizing a small startup. Our mental models thus tend to settle over time, and it takes progressively bigger and bigger shocks to shake them up. In essence, we balance exploring and exploiting over our lifetimes. The early emphasis is on exploring while we form our mental models and get feedback from the environment, but eventually we settle into a groove, and the emphasis shifts to exploiting the model we have developed. This is not an “ageist” argument, and certainly there are examples of fuddy-duddy twenty-year-olds and adaptable seventy-year-olds. But in broad terms, the structures of our mental models do change over time, and there are strengths and weaknesses at each stage of development. The implications for organizations, however, are important. Stable mental models work well in stable environments, which is to say, most of the time. However, as we noted previously, the punctuated nature of change in complex adaptive systems is almost perniciously designed to lull our pattern-recognizing, rule-building minds into a sense of stability and then hit us with big changes. Firms tend to be organized as hierarchies, with the people who are most experienced sitting at the top. This arrangement presents a trade-off: the mental models at the top are likely to be some of the best for the purposes of execution in a stable environment, but less capable of exploring, and less likely to adapt to environmental shifts. The result can be significant inertia in an organization when environmental change does occur. This mental model inertia helps explain why many turnaround situations involve wholesale changes in top management. It is often easier and faster to simply change the people than to change their mental models. If resistance to change in experienced mental models is a deep feature of human cognition, then how can we guard against it? A good starting point is simple acknowledgment of it at the top. Those running organizations must recognize that, while their wisdom may be highly valuable, their sensitivity to change and flexibility may be low. Likewise, their seniority may intimidate junior people, who are usually more aware of changes in the environment and have different perspectives... To make a diversity of mental models effective, however, the senior leadership team must also embrace a nonhierarchical culture that is open to challenge and debate...

> Individuals: “Rigids” Versus “Flexibles”
>
> ... Harrington notes that the less frequent, more abrupt, and more severe the transitions, the more dominant the Rigids are and the more disastrous the situation is when the environment actually shifts. In environments that are more continuously volatile, the Flexibles tend to do better. Harrington measured the economic efficiency of his model organizations during these transitions and found that the amount of economic loss was directly related to the number of Flexibles the organization managed to hold on to during the stable period. Organizations that drove out the Flexibles and were dominated by Rigids tended to do very well during the stable period (e.g., met all their earnings targets), but then really blew up when the punctuation point hit. In contrast, organizations that managed to hang on to a reserve of Flexibles and maintained a better mix between the two types did somewhat worse during the stable era (they were less efficient), but managed the adaptive transitions much more smoothly.
>
> Structure: How Much Hierarchy?
>
> ... Jack Welch has referred to structure as the “hardware” side of organization—the design of reporting relationships, managerial processes, and the configuration of the firm’s resources. Earlier in the book, we discussed the beneficial role that hierarchy plays in organizations. It enables the network structure to be organized in such a way that decisions can be made without everyone having to talk to everyone else, and thus prevent the gridlock of complexity catastrophes. Organizations with insufficient hierarchy have difficulty changing and adapting because the density of communications is too high, and the need for consensus slows down decision making... In this section, we will see that hierarchy, while necessary, can also get in the way of adaptability. Scott Page, a political scientist and associate director of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan, has examined the question, why do organizations evolve different amounts of hierarchy? Why are some organizations broad and flat, while others are narrow and deep?... Page posited that organizations evolve to match the nature and difficulty of the problems they are trying to solve. In rough terms, if the problem can easily be chunked into parallel tasks and doesn’t require much sequencing, then the organization will reflect this simplicity and tend to be broad and flat. If the problem cannot be easily divided up and has numerous sequential steps, then the organizational hierarchy will tend to be narrow and deep... Consequently, companies rarely see exploration activities arising organically out of their mainstream execution hierarchies—it is a mismatch between the organizational structure and the nature of the problem. It is also why at many companies, when senior management sees a need for exploration, they pull small teams out of the hierarchy, put them in separate buildings, and create various forms of Skunk Works to pursue innovation initiatives. Such initiatives can be successful. Apple Computer’s Macintosh, for example, was famously developed by a small, autonomous team with a pirate flag flying from the mast of its separate building. Skunk Works that are separate from the execution hierarchy may often be the only way to address this mismatch. But there are two pitfalls that such approaches often run into. First, if all such exploration initiatives are run and funded by the corporate center, then the organization will inevitably explore only a limited section of the fitness landscape—the section that happens to be on the radar screen of senior management. Second, there are often problems reintegrating such initiates back into the mainstream organization. Reintegration is, of course, essential if a successful initiative is eventually to be amplified. Both issues are made easier when, in addition to the corporate portfolio, the business units also have the resources and autonomy to run portfolios of experiments themselves. This enables a broader exploration of the landscape and provides a more natural path for reintegrating successful initiatives back into the organization.
>
> Structure: The Coevolution of Resources and Business Plans
>
> ... In short, resources are what management teams draw on to exploit opportunities... But as plans are executed, management changes the configuration of resources and thus changes the space of possible future Business Plans. There is thus a continuous, coevolutionary loop between Business Plans and firm resources. This coevolution between plans and resources creates path dependence in the structure of organizations and provides another important barrier to adaptation... Major changes in industry and strategic focus can successfully occur, but in a step-by-step evolutionary fashion, rather than through single leaps... Penrose’s theory further reinforces the need for portfolios of strategic experiments. Not only do such portfolios create a greater diversity of Business Plans within organizations, but the initiatives in such portfolios also create a greater diversity of resources...
>
> Culture: Rules of Behavior
>
> ... I will use a definition that fits with our evolutionary framework, but is similar in spirit to a widely used definition from the anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson: 'Culture is an emergent characteristic of a group of agents and is determined by the agents’ rules of behavior (or norms) for acting in their social environment and for interacting with each other. Cultural rules are socially transmitted and learned.' Cultural norms are in short the rules of thumb for behaving in a social environment. Norms are “should” or “ought” statements about what is considered the right, appropriate, or the expected thing to do, by the society or organization in a given situation. We can think of culture in an organizational context as a set of concentric rings, moving from the most widely shared norms, to ones that are more specific and individual. In the outermost ring are the norms that virtually all humans share. Evidence from anthropologists and cognitive scientists shows that a relatively small set of norms comes as standard equipment in human minds and is likely the product of our biological evolution. For example, murder is a universal prohibition, and likewise, as we saw earlier, all societies have norms about reciprocal behavior. The specific tunings of these basic norms, however, are accomplished through a process of imitation and teaching and are thus culturally transmitted. For example, what constitutes murder might differ by society (e.g., definitions of “honor” killings, self-defense, and war), and as we saw in chapter 6, what constitutes fairness might differ by society. Moving inward, to the next ring, we see a vast universe of culturally specific norms. These norms have evolved in particular societies and are transmitted from person to person over time, from parent to child, from teacher to student, from boss to worker, from friend to friend, and so on. Culturally specific norms are spread through a variety of channels, such as stories, music, religion, writing, and the media. These norms often cover a very wide set of behaviors, ranging from sexual norms, to how guests are treated, to how to signal respect for another person. Such rules of behavior produce endless sources of friction when people from different cultures collide, as well as endless sources of humor when tourists try to navigate their way in a strange country. Within the broad swath of societal norms, there are often subgroups, and sub-subgroups, as determined by geography, religion, or other factors... We can then locate organizational culture at the next ring heading inward. Organizational cultures always exist in the broader context of societal cultures and, more generally, human culture. But organizations, including companies, develop their own unique cultures over time. We can think of these as the rules of behavior for interacting within a specific organization. For example, an organization might have a culture in which junior people feel free to speak up and express their views, or it might be an authoritarian culture in which junior staff defer to their seniors. Alternatively, a company might have a culture in which commitments are flexible and not taken very seriously, or one in which commitments are considered binding and there are serious consequences for missing them. The key is that these are organization-specific and not just general societal traits... Many companies and management books use the term values when discussing corporate culture, and we should distinguish between values and norms. Values are statements of belief about what is important, such as “we value an egalitarian approach to teamwork.” Norms, on the other hand, are statements with “should” or “ought” in them, such as “you should behave in a nonhierarchical way when working in teams.” Values and norms tend to go in pairs of beliefs and behaviors (e.g., egalitarian beliefs and nonhierarchical behaviors). Many companies use the terms interchangeably, but I will use the terms norms, or cultural rules, to emphasize that what matters is the translation into individual behavior. Finally, located in the innermost circle are individual norms. Every person has an individual set of rules of behavior that he or she follows... The way we can distinguish between idiosyncratic norms and organizational, societal, or human norms is to ask how widely shared the norms are. For example, one person in her youth might learn that individual initiative is rewarded, while another might come to believe that the best policy is to keep her head down and go with the flow. If initiative taking is a common feature in a society, then we would say it is a broad societal norm; if it is randomly scattered in the society but common in a particular organization, then initiative taking would be an organizational norm. Finally, if this rule of behavior was randomly scattered in the organization, but certain individuals had it, then it would be an individual norm.

> Culture: The Ten Commandments
>
> ... But just as Tolstoy famously said, “All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” a handful of traits seem to crop up with regularity in studies of the cultures of high-performing and adaptive companies. I have collected some of these traits into a list of ten norms... I have grouped the norms into three categories. The first relates to individual performance: “how should I behave when I am on my own and no one is watching?” The second describes cooperative behavior: “how should I behave when interacting with others?” And the third describes behaviors that facilitate exploration and innovation.

> Each of these norms plays a critical role in the executing-versus-adapting story and in reducing the dependency of the organization on structure and process. Individual performance norms clearly have an important impact on execution. But they also play a role in adaptation. If individual performance norms are deeply embedded in an organization and succeed in driving individual behavior, then the hierarchy and processes don’t have to be quite so tight and restrictive to achieve good performance. If the hierarchy and centralized control processes don’t have to be so tight, this in turn enables the organization to have more slack resources for experimentation and to drive responsibility closer to the frontline. When individual performance norms are poor, the hierarchy tends to crack down and tighten processes, perhaps succeeding in boosting execution, but damaging the organization’s ability to adapt. Cooperative norms also have important effects on both adaptation and execution. In low-trust, low-cooperation environments, interactions between agents must be spelled out in great detail, with numerous rules and little flexibility. One sees this in organizations in which labor and management have poor relations and unions have stepped in with detailed contracts that specify which person can pick up which screwdriver. Norms that foster trust and cooperation allow people to use their brains to determine what is best, given the circumstances, creating both better performance and the possibility of experimentation and improvement. Finally, norms for individual performance, trust, and cooperative behavior are all necessary but not sufficient conditions for adaptation. There must be an additional set of norms that push individuals to explore and take risks. Furthermore, there must be norms that help protect such individuals in the organization (e.g., norms 7 and 9) and give them the space to innovate... The reality for most organizations, however, is that they truly live few, if any, of these norms. Despite what may be written on posters in the company lobby or on plastic cubes on people’s desks, at many companies, values and culture are not top management priorities. In such companies, the culture evolves organically through the interactions of employees, with little shaping by senior management. Such organizational cultures tend to be a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. For example, some organizations may be strong on individual performance norms, but weak on cooperative norms, or vice versa. There are inherent tensions between the norms in the top-ten list, for example, the tensions between an intense, performance-oriented meritocracy and the need for teamwork. Unless these tensions are actively managed through senior leadership and reinforced by the structural side of the organization, some subset of the norms inevitably comes to dominate. It is thus virtually impossible for a set of norms that is balanced across individual performance, cooperation, and innovation to arise organically without strong leadership.

> Executing and adapting appear to be irreconcilable opposites, and the empirical data we discussed in the previous chapter suggests that most companies are destined to favor the former over the latter. But by understanding the sources of this schism, we can also begin to see the outlines of a potential solution. By shifting the central lever of management from the hardware of organizational structure to the software of culture, we can begin to address each of these issues.
>
> At a crude level, there are fundamentally only two ways of running a large organization. One is to use the structure of management hierarchy. We can define roles, goals, tasks, and procedures; then measure individual and group performance against those goals; and reward and punish accordingly. Such a structure serves to reduce the degrees of freedom of individual agents and constrain them to desired behaviors. The benefits of this approach are control, reliability, and predictability. Using the structure lever increases the odds that people will do what they are supposed to do, and not do what they are not supposed to do. Although I’ve described the use of hierarchy in rather unflattering terms, it can be very satisfying for people to have a well-defined role, interesting tasks to carry out, and clear measures of success—particularly if it pays well. Without such hierarchical structures, we’d still be in caves rubbing sticks together to make fire.
>
> The second method still requires the skeleton of hierarchy, but uses less command-and-control muscle on the bones. Rather than using structure and process to guide individual behavior, an organization can rely more heavily on culture. The primary advantage of a culturally driven organization is that cultural rules tend to be more flexible than structures. Cultural rules provide general guidance, but leave the “how” up to the individual. In short, they require individuals to use their brains.
>
> Cultural rules can be used to address each of the issues we have identified. Overoptimism and risk aversion can be counterbalanced with cultural norms that encourage people to face reality, make fact-based decisions, and take thoughtful risks. Likewise, the entrenchment of senior mental models can be addressed by a nonhierarchical culture that creates not just an expectation that junior people will speak their minds, but an obligation (McKinsey calls this “the obligation to dissent”). The rigid-versus-flexible issue can be mitigated by a culture that embraces a diversity of management styles and that values both execution and innovation skill sets. Finally, the structural issues that tend to favor execution hierarchies over portfolios of experiments can also be offset by changes in culture. In particular, boosting individual performance and cooperation norms can enable a looser hierarchical structure without a consequent loss in near-term performance. This in turn enables resources and responsibility for experimentation to be pushed deeper into the organization.
>
> Moving to a more culturally led management approach does not mean abandoning the hardware of structure and process. On the contrary, as we have noted, a social architecture needs both. Rather, it means that the hardware and software sides of the organization must be consistent and mutually reinforcing. One can work backward and ask, if the objective is to better balance executing and adapting, then what kind of culture would support that objective, and what kind of structure and processes would support that culture? For example, if one of the desired norms is individual accountability, but there are no rewards for those who achieve targets, and no penalties for those who miss, then the norm will merely be empty words. Likewise, norms around innovating and risk taking need to be supported by a constellation of budgeting, human resources, and performance processes.
>
> Perhaps the most critical hardware levers in a social architecture are a company’s human resources and training processes. Rather than fight human nature, strong-culture companies recognize that it is far easier to hire the right people who culturally fit than it is to create them. Thus, these companies have a very strong perspective on what kind of candidates have the “right DNA” for the organization, and actively screen for those qualities. But even though the new hires might have the right raw material, strong-culture companies don’t assume that new hires will adopt the culture simply through osmosis. Instead, such companies have carefully engineered induction processes that introduce new recruits to the norms and then reinforce the norms in training and other programs throughout the person’s career. Evaluation and promotion further reinforce the culture by explicitly rewarding those who live the norms and by withholding rewards from, or punishing, those who do not. People receive a consistent message on the culture from these processes, literally from their first interview to retirement.
>
> Finally, senior management behavior and communications play an enormous role in building and perpetuating a culturally led social architecture. It is a cliché, but nonetheless true, that if senior management does not walk the talk and model the desired norms, then no one else will. As mentioned before, carefully balanced systems of cultural norms do not arise organically, and thus all strong-culture companies have sometime in their history had a CEO who played the role of chief cultural architect and enforcement officer. These individuals carefully designed the set of desired norms for their companies, personally and passionately ensured consistency against those norms by their senior team, drove the norms deep into their organizations, and then created mechanisms to ensure that the norms would be perpetuated. Over time, once a culture is well established, cultural design and enforcement can (and should) become the collective responsibility of the senior team, but during the crucial period when the culture is being built, there is no substitute for personal CEO leadership.
>
> Communications is also naturally important, and cognitive science tells us that most corporate change programs are 180 degrees backward. Humans are fairly stubborn creatures and don’t just immediately change their mental models and behaviors in responses to speeches from their bosses, or because of PowerPoint presentations or plastic cubes with inspirational messages. Instead of trying to appeal to our fact-based, deductive sides, corporate change programs need to address the story-loving, pattern-recognizing, more emotional, inductive side of human cognition. People need to be jolted from their existing mental models and see an urgent and personal gap between the way things are and the way things need to be. A change program needs to have a fact-based argument underlying it, but the emphasis in communications should be on stories, analogies, and patterns to help people see the issues. Most change programs are also very passive, with lots of communications cascading down from on high. But learning is interactive, and thus a change program needs to get people to personally grapple with the issues.

> Many executives find the idea of sound bites mildly distasteful and associate them with politicians. But the reality of human cognition is that we remember short, catchy, rhythmic phrases that use alliteration, metaphor, humorous twists, or other tricks. Jack Welch was the master of the carefully engineered sound bite and used them with great effect to drive norms of behavior into the GE organization. Finally, intense repetition is essential. There is a reason why religious leaders see their flocks weekly, and why politicians give the same stump speech until they are blue in the face—our minds tend to weight messages by frequency as much as quality...

> One of the questions Edith Penrose asked in her Theory of the Growth of the Firm was, what, if any, are the fundamental constraints on firm size and growth? She identified two. The first is the ability to manage complexity. At some point, an organization can simply become, as Penrose put it, “too big … to be efficiently handled.” The outer envelope of this constraint, however, has continued to advance, as our Physical and Social Technologies have evolved. Clearly, it is easier to run a large, global organization with computers, telephones, airplanes, and modern management techniques than it is with letters, carrier pigeons, steamships, and nineteenth-century STs. Indeed, there is evidence that this constraint has loosened over time, as the average number of employees in a Fortune 500 company has nearly tripled, from around 16,000 in 1955 when the list was first published, to nearly 48,000 in 2003.
>
> The second constraint Penrose identified was knowledge. A firm can only grow as fast as its knowledge. And, since knowledge is the product of evolutionary processes, we can say that a firm can only grow as fast as its evolutionary processes allow it to grow. Although the size of organizations in the economy has grown, the shape of the distribution of both firm size and growth rates has remained remarkably stable. According to work by Robert Axtell at the Brookings Institution and Gene Stanley at Boston University, both are distributed according to our old friend, the power law. The existence of these power laws suggests that there are indeed constraints at work on the system. One can hypothesize that perhaps it is Penrose’s second constraint that is holding us back. Our PTs and STs have enabled organizations to develop coordinating, controlling, and executing abilities that are far ahead of their innovating and knowledge-creating abilities.
>
> If true, this means that we are operating at a level vastly below our human potential. The great cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky observed that what we call “intelligence” is not a singular thing; rather, it is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the collective interactions of many individual parts. The magic of intelligence is that when those parts are organized in a particular way, they can do things that no individual part could do on its own. Minsky called this description of intelligence “the society of mind.”
>
> We can think of human organizations as passing through three stages of development. The first stage was the evolution of STs that enabled strangers to reliably cooperate with each other. The second stage was the creation of large-scale organizations that could exploit the PTs of the industrial revolution. But perhaps now we are at the beginning of a third stage. We are only just now learning how to create “societies of minds” in our largest organizations.
>
> Most organizations tap only a small fraction of the brainpower of their people. The hierarchical command-and-control organizations that arose out of the industrial age enabled humans to achieve cooperation on scales once unimaginable and execute Business Plan designs of immense complexity. Nevertheless, the inherent rigidities of these structures ultimately limit them to being evolutionary fodder in the churnings of markets. But through the lever of culture, companies can create true societies within their organizations and free the minds of their people. As in any society, along with freedom comes responsibility, and the culture must support performance and execution, as well as exploration and adaptation. Creating such a culture is truly “social engineering” with all the consequent risks and unpredictability associated with the phrase. But for companies that succeed, the reward is the creation of institutions that can be engines of wealth creation for generations to come." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.
