> "Companies and corporate structures are 17th-century constructs based on pre-industrial models of allocation of scarcity in the face of risk. The future of humanity is one of physical abundance for our biological forms, but UNLIMITED UPSIDE for our cognitive and spiritual essences. I refuse to submit my & my childrens' future to the lazy inertia of existing economic paradigms.

Instead we produced trillion dollar companies that held our data captive to create surveillance and attention economies, rather than empowering end users and fostering the development of end-user creativity and innovation.

SO MUCH of this growth was fueled by the gift economics of nerd communities producing open-source software and cohering de facto OPEN STANDARDS which neither governments nor BigCo nor academia could produce.

> "Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world." - [Fredric Jameson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7690016-someone-once-said-that-it-is-easier-to-imagine-the)

> "It often happens that the universal belief of one age of mankind... becomes to a subsequent age so palpable an absurdity, that the only difficulty then is to imagine how such a thing can ever have appeared credible." - [John Stuart Mill](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/652591)

> "The most pragmatic problem is the future of this planet, and its survival. And I think one of the great disgraces of academic economists is that they're not at the forefront of this. It's morally reprehensible that they're not leading the way." - [Geoffrey West](https://twitter.com/sfiscience/status/1193262457566842881)

> "We have a hundred trillion cells in our bodies and each one of them has thirty thousand recycling centres renewing our proteins. They're so hi-tech that they can take in a protein, disassemble it, build a new protein (perhaps an entirely different kind) and issue the new protein. That's as if we could stick trees into a chipper machine and get a live tree out the other side. Very hi-tech! We're not nearly as hi-tech yet, as our own internal microworld.
>
> We have a great deal to learn from nature. Take economics. If we ran our bodies' economy the way our economy is run it might look something like this. We could call the heart-lung system the “northern industrial organs”. You give them ownership of the bones in which you mine the raw material blood cells that arise in the marrow. Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today. You can see that a living system can't function that way." - [After Darwin, by Elisabet Sahtouris](https://ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/AfterDarwin.html#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20hundred,can%27t%20function%20that%20way.)

> "What kind of competition is there in your body? Suppose your brain said ' I'm the most important organ, and the liver said 'I am, and I want to go in a free enterprise-system.' You would rot away in a month, if every organ of your body, were out for itself." - [Jacque Fresco](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/728466)

> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account." - [Friedrich A. Hayek](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6867865-the-curious-task-of-economics-is-to-demonstrate-to-men)

Stagnation & optimizing for the wrong thing (GDP)

> "You have as much computing power in your iPhone as was available at the time of the Apollo missions. But what is it being used for? It’s being used to throw angry birds at pigs; it’s being used to send pictures of your cat to people halfway around the world; it’s being used to check in as the virtual mayor of a virtual nowhere while you’re riding a subway from the nineteenth century." - [Peter Thiel](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/720837)

They still price in the labor and input costs, but there's no need for a marketing budget?

> "As the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decisionmaking and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the “homo economicus” with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a “homo socialis” with other-regarding preferences. While the “homo economicus” optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the “homo socialis” are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. Notably, the “homo socialis” manages to earn higher payoffs than the “homo economicus”.
>
> I show that the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the “homo economicus” (“economics 1.0”), a complementary theory must be developed for the “homo socialis”. This economic theory might be called “economics 2.0” or “socionomics”. The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as “participatory market society”.

We need to crowdsource the quantification of how much anything costs

Here’s what the operating system for humanity should enable: state a problem and incentivize someone to solve it. Recursively/iteratively and in parallel - pointing to problems, ranking them, and rewarding for them being solved

We need to move from a money-on-money-return world to a transparency-on-transparency-return world

Capitalism is suffering from opacity

The metaverse is a parallel economy
Parallel media, economy & governance

Laissez-faire capitalism needs to end
We're in a free for all and that should scare everybody

The invisible hand has no competition - it’s left unchecked and is ripping meaning and morals out of our civilization. If you truly care about competition we should introduce it at the most fundamental level and give rise to another invisible hand that’s not fungible to material possessions but is all about the meaning of life and recognition by and connection to others.
We need a meta-invisible hand that will tune the relationship and distribution of money (claims over resources) and human values


An open-source economy

the biggest harms in the world come from opaqueness on the enterprise level

We have to incentivise contribution to the common good and we have to decouple that from resources - we need a new incentive

The completely open global do-it-all company

A publicly run parallel socioeconomic system embedded within the current one - parasitizing it from within

We need to make a single coherent company for everyone for everything - we need to reduce the costs of cooperation and define the protocols for status and redistribution

The most meta-economic thing to do is to incentivize the truth bubble up

The most important thing to compute is the most optimal way to cooperate and coordinate.

Thomas Hobbes (1642): Few except those who love praise do anything to deserve it.
(Hobbes 1998: 23)

John Locke (1678) The principal spring from which the actions of men take their rise, the
rule they conduct them by, and the end to which they direct them, seems to be credit
and reputation, and that which at any rate they avoid, is in the greatest part shame and
disgrace. (Locke 1993: 236)

Kant (1786): A craving to inspire in others esteem for ourselves, through good behaviour
(repression of that which could arouse in them a poor opinion of us) is the real
basis of all true sociality. (Lovejoy 1961: 193)

John Adams (1790): no appetite in human nature is more universal than that for honor.
(Adams 1973: 51)



> "The three ruling passions in human life are often said to be the desire for property, the desire for power, and the desire for prestige or status or esteem. The eVects of the Wrst desire are charted in standard economics, the eVects of the second in political science—and of course in the annals of history. But the eVects of the desire for esteem have escaped the sustained attention of social scientists. It is almost as if there were a conspiracy not to register or document the fact that we are, and always have been, an honour-hungry species." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "What economics and politics reveal in the domain of property and power is that the unintended consequences of people’s desires congeal into aggregate patterns that affect in turn what individuals can and choose to do. The competition for property dictates the prices at which individual goods can be obtained, for example, while the competition for power dictates the opportunities for individuals to find a place among others and to exercise influence. Both disciplines, however, have a normative as well as a positive or empirical side. They not only seek to reveal how things actually turn out as a result of people’s interactions, but also try to identify ways in which they might be made to turn out better. Thus economics specialises in identifying more efficient systems of production and distribution, politics in charting more stable ways of organising the dispensation whereby power is allocated among individuals and groups. And specialists in each discipline equally argue for improvements that would have beneficial consequences, not just for endogenous ideals like efficiency and stability, but also for ideals—perhaps more controversial ideals—like freedom, community, and equality.
>
> We see no reason why there shouldn’t be a study that serves these same positive and normative ends in regard to the system generated by people’s desire for esteem. Were it distinct enough to earn a Greek name on a par with ‘economics’ and ‘politics’, we might call it ‘kudonomics’: the study of the laws governing the system of kudos or renown... There is an economy in property, an economy in power, and there is also, so we believe, an economy in esteem." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Economies are systems whereby scarce resources are allocated among competing parties. In particular, they are systems of allocation that have an interactive or aggregative dimension. What individual agents do gives rise to aggregate patterns that feed back in turn into the things that determine what individual agents do; they feed back, for example, into the determination of people’s opportunities and expectations. This more or less standard account of an economy is completely general, abstracting from the sorts of resources that are allocated...
>
> Our aim in this book is to look at the scope for studying, in the manner of an economics, the system whereby perhaps the most important resource of this attitudinal kind—esteem—is allocated among individuals...
>
> Esteem cannot be given away or traded in the ordinary manner, for there is no way that I can buy the good opinion of another or sell to others my good opinion of them... But though it is non-tradable in that sense, esteem is still a good that is allocated in society according to more or less systematic determinants; and it is a good whose allocation has an interactive, aggregative aspect. Thus there is room, at least on the face of it, for studying both the positive results of that emerging pattern and the normative prospects for changing that pattern in a way that is generally beneficial." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Some economists will say that esteem is taken into account in standard theory to the extent that reputation—say, the reputation for delivering on time or for delivering at a certain level of quality—is seen as an important resource for someone in the market. But reputation is distinct from esteem in our sense. Esteem may accrue to someone who is not reidentifiable—someone who lacks a recognisable name or face—whereas reputation presupposes reidentifiability. And the two notions come apart even where reidentifiability is assumed...
>
> The tendency among economists who discuss the value of reputation is to see it as deriving entirely from the value of the commodities it enables an agent to secure. Like money, esteem is taken to give an agent a certain purchasing power in the domain of consumption goods—an expectation of being able to use it to obtain such goods—and that is assumed to be the reason it is attractive. We do not think that this reductionist view of market reputation carries over to esteem more generally. We seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among people we are very unlikely to meet again; we even seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among those who will live after our time and whom we will never meet. It is hard to see how this could make sense if esteem had no value for us other than as a means of securing consumption goods." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "The economics of any system of allocation tries not just to understand the system, as mentioned, but also to see how far it can be made to work better and to work for the better promotion of what is regarded as the common good. It constitutes a normative as well as a positive economics. And there is enormous scope, it turns out, for exploring the normative potential of the economy of esteem.
>
> It is common nowadays to think that there are only two reliable controls available for ensuring that people will act in a manner that conduces to the common good: the one is the invisible hand of the market, the other the iron hand of law and administration—the iron hand of the state... Governments have tried to market more and more of the services that used to be provided in the non-marketed sector of the economy—services in education, research, health, counselling, and the like. And, where marketing is impossible or problematic, they have sought to impose a tougher regime of monitoring and management: they have tried to subject those providing the services to ever more intrusive forms of surveillance and accounting.
>
> We think that this dichotomous picture of regulatory possibilities is misconceived. In particular, we think that it overlooks the possibility of subjecting people to a quite different sort of discipline: that involved in being required to act so as to secure esteem and escape disesteem. We think of this discipline as an intangible hand that complements the invisible and iron hands that have monopolised the attention of regulators. The forces of esteem are distinctively associated, not with the market, and not with the state, but with what is nowadays often described as civil society. One of the most interesting projects in institutional design is to investigate the conditions under which the intangible hand can be expected to work well and, in particular, to work for the production of what is generally seen as the common good.
>
> The distinction between the iron hand, the invisible hand, and the intangible hand is analytically well grounded. The iron hand involves actions that intentionally sanction agents—reward or punish them—so that they behave in a certain way; it is represented, for example, in the legal and regulatory initiatives of the state. The invisible hand also involves actions that serve to sanction agents—for example, the actions of consumers in seeking out the cheapest provider of a certain good—but those actions are not designed intentionally to elicit a certain pattern of behaviour, such as competitive pricing; they serve as rewards and penalties that elicit that pattern but they are not necessarily intended by their agents in that role. The intangible hand is like the invisible hand, and unlike the iron hand, in deploying non-intentional sanctions of this kind. But it is unlike the invisible hand, in that the sanctions deployed involve the formation of attitudes—rewards of esteem, penalties of disesteem—not, or at least not necessarily, the performance of actions." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Adam Smith, the founder of economics, was himself a great believer in the attraction that people feel for esteem, and the repulsion that they feel for disesteem. ‘Nature, when she formed man for society’, he wrote, ‘endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original aversion to offend his brethren. She taught him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regard’. In adopting this view, Smith was following a tradition of emphasis on the importance of the esteem motive that had been present in Western thought in the time of the Greeks and the Romans, had resurfaced with emphasis in the Renaissance, and had become a major theme in the moral and social treatises of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries...
>
> The belief in the power of esteem led Smith even to argue that the reason why we seek out wealth, the reason why we want to have more and more to spend on what he called baubles and trinkets, is that by achieving conspicuousness in such possessions, we win distinction and esteem. ‘It is the vanity, not the ease or the pleasure, which interests us’. Writing in 1790, John Adams gave nice expression to the same idea. ‘Riches force the opinion on a man that he is the object of the congratulations of others; and he feels that they attract the complaisance of the public.’
>
> But this view that it is an interest in esteem that fuels the desire for material goods and services largely disappeared with the development of mainstream economics...
>
> We can think of three main reasons why esteem may have slipped out of focus among economists and social scientists in the two centuries since Smith wrote his path-breaking books. One is that with the advent of economics, in particular with the discovery of invisible-hand possibilities of social ordering, it became unfashionable to give attention to any mode of social discipline that invoked virtue in some way. Bernard Mandeville, in his Fable of the Bees, was very influential in preaching that private vice was public virtue and, albeit Smith wanted to distance himself from Mandevillean irony, the invisible hand gave a certain substance to that rather paradoxical lesson. The centrepiece example of the invisible hand was the open and free market in which, so it was claimed, the individual pursuit of advantage—shameless self-seeking, as it appeared to many—would guarantee that goods were made available, to the beneWt of all, at competitive prices.

> ... Esteem and virtue go closely together. Thus in letting go of individual virtue as a source of collective order, economists and social scientists may have let go at the same time of the desire for being thought to be virtuous as a source of such order." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "We believe, as Adam Smith believed, that it is nature that endows people with an attraction for esteem, not just the corrupt culture of an old-style aristocracy. We believe that even if the invisible hand is a potent force of social order, still there is a lot of force attaching also to the intangible hand." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Among the things that may be expected to move people most reliably and forcibly is the desire to be thought well of by their fellows and the aversion to being regarded badly. People, so it was generally held, live under the regime or law of opinion and that regime moulds all that they are and do. It provides a gravitational field that silently shapes their dispositions and their doings, exerting a long, insistent influence that can only be resisted at the cost of considerable effort and self-sacrifice." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In many cases... we will prefer someone to behave more virtuously, if with a greater desire for esteem, than to have them behave less virtuously but with a lesser concern to be admired." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Attitude-dependent goods of esteem may rationally be substituted by individuals for such material, action-dependent goods, as when someone foregoes a larger salary elsewhere in order to remain attached to a more estimable organisation—an organisation that may be expected to give them greater personal standing than the alternative—or when someone forgoes such esteem for a rise in salary." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Just as the economy of esteem is not insulated from the material economy or the regime of power, neither is it really a single, homogeneous system in itself. There will be many overlapping subsystems within the economy of esteem in almost any contemporary society. And almost every individual will belong to a number of those subsystems, having a stake in how he or she stands in each. The subsystems will compete with one another for the energy and time of participants. And they will often be in conflict, in the sense that a high performance in one will count against performing well in another. Teenagers at school will have a stake in how they are thought of by parents, teachers, and peers but will find, in all likelihood, that it is hard to do well simultaneously in each of those subcultures. Peers may deride them for a high standing in the other groups, for example, and may drive them into systematically underperforming on those fronts." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem incentives operate in a context where there are feedback eVects between individual action and the social context within which such action is pursued. The performance level of each individual contributes to the standards by which each performer is assessed. Accordingly, there are, as we might put it, unintended consequences in play in the economy of esteem. To appeal to the terminology of Schelling’s (1978) book, micro-motives create macro-behaviour patterns that are not simply a direct magnification of the individual case." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem eVects still play an extensive role, both in explaining the allocation of persons across activities that might be sources of esteem, and in disciplining poor performance and encouraging high performance in those domains that do not admit the possibility of exit." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "When the number of persons in a given population who comply is relatively small, there will be positive esteem associated with so acting. Then, as the number of compliers increases, the amount of esteem attached to so acting will decline and conceivably disappear. For example, when few people tell the truth, doing so will be remarkable and represent a potentially significant source of esteem. But when most people are telling the truth, truth-telling is unremarkable and its esteem utility on that account unlikely to be very high. However, this fact does not necessarily imply that, over the range where most people conform, esteem eVects disappear. For, as it becomes a matter of course that people comply, it tends to become a source of disesteem to fail to do so. Accordingly, esteem-based incentives to comply with the norm are operative with varying levels of intensity more or less over the whole range. At the same time, the level of compliance that is forthcoming will be a positive function of the amount of esteem attached. The larger the esteem reward for complying, and/or the larger the disesteem penalty for not complying, the higher the level of compliance is likely to be." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Richard McAdams (1997) offers an example of a possible bootstrap phenomenon in relation to ideals of recycling. The story, as McAdams tells it, goes this way. Initially, recycling is a somewhat eccentric practice engaged in only by the environmental enthusiast extreme. Within that group, however, recycling gradually takes on the status of an appropriate ideal. And in the process, the practice accumulates an increasingly articulate normative defence. With that normative defence in place, those who recycle enjoy a certain level of esteem, at least from among the environmentally conscious. Recycling comes to signal a special environmental sensitivity that even those who don’t practise it are increasingly inclined to applaud. More and more people recycle in response to the esteem attached to the practice—and gradually the practice becomes normal. Once normal, however, it no longer reflects any particular credit on its practitioners, so positive esteem evaporates. At the same time, those who don’t recycle now begin to become conspicuous. Their conduct increasingly reveals an environmental insensitivity that is at Wrst mildly irritating and then begins to seem, as it becomes rarer, positively intransigent. Eventually, an apparently stable equilibrium is reached in which the only non-compliers are the especially shameless, the determined anti-environmentalists, and those who like to oVend. The practice of recycling has become established, bootstrapped up from an initial situation in which the practice was relatively rare." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Part of the reason for our interest in publicity is that it seems to us to be the chief means by which the forces of esteem can be channelled and directed. By increasing the exposure afforded to performances, one can increase the associated esteem incentives without incidentally inducing changes in the basic operation of the esteem economy. Publicity is, in that sense, the main lever available for policy intervention." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Policy for increasing publicity—either by inhibiting secrecy (i.e. increasing the likelihood of observation) or by providing information/exposure on a subsidised basis—is one of the readiest means by which the economy of esteem can be supported by explicitly collective interventions. Equally, policies that support secrecy or require privacy or otherwise inhibit the extent of exposure are a primary means for undermining esteem-related incentives." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)
