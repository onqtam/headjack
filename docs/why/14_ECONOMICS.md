Eudaemonic economy

Conscious economics

> "Economics can be seen as the interface layer between our values and the way we build the world." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://thecitesite.com/authors/daniel-schmachtenberger/#:~:text=Economics%20can%20be%20seen%20as%20the%20interface%20layer%20between%20our%20values%20and%20the%20way%20we%20build%20the%20world.)

> "People get confused sometimes they think an economy is money. Money is a database for exchange of goods & services. Money doesn't have power in & of itself. The actual economy is goods & services." - [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/cb_doge/status/1550819912725123072)

> "Companies and corporate structures are 17th-century constructs based on pre-industrial models of allocation of scarcity in the face of risk. The future of humanity is one of physical abundance for our biological forms, but UNLIMITED UPSIDE for our cognitive and spiritual essences. I refuse to submit my & my childrens' future to the lazy inertia of existing economic paradigms.
>
> We failed to secure open innovation in software, and we failed to lock the Web open. Instead we produced trillion dollar companies that held our data captive to create surveillance and attention economies, rather than empowering end users and fostering the development of end-user creativity and innovation.
>
> Two generations of investors are now completely hooked on this model of extractive network effects. SO MUCH of this growth was fueled by the gift economics of nerd communities producing open-source software and cohering de facto OPEN STANDARDS which neither governments nor BigCo nor academia could produce. These Schelling points that balanced risk, utility, and user needs are brilliant examples of alternative economic models for an abundant, regenerative future." - [Peter Wang](https://twitter.com/pwang/status/1765073129431588994)

> "The most valuable businesses of coming decades will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete." - [Peter Thiel](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/5199889-the-most-valuable-businesses-of-coming-decades-will-be-built)

> "Sometimes I try to imagine a world where scientific young minds enjoyed greater rewards for revolutionizing, like, farming methods, manufacturing, or energy, rather than the dark patterns used to optimize ad-clicks at Google and Facebook. How did we get here?" - [Edward Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1451342274667876353)

How Complexity Economics Can Save the World

> "Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. We can now revise that and witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of imagining the end of the world." - [Fredric Jameson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7690016-someone-once-said-that-it-is-easier-to-imagine-the)

> "It often happens that the universal belief of one age of mankind... becomes to a subsequent age so palpable an absurdity, that the only difficulty then is to imagine how such a thing can ever have appeared credible." - [John Stuart Mill](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/652591)

> "The most pragmatic problem is the future of this planet, and its survival. And I think one of the great disgraces of academic economists is that they're not at the forefront of this. It's morally reprehensible that they're not leading the way." - [Geoffrey West](https://twitter.com/sfiscience/status/1193262457566842881)

> "We have a hundred trillion cells in our bodies and each one of them has thirty thousand recycling centres renewing our proteins. They're so hi-tech that they can take in a protein, disassemble it, build a new protein (perhaps an entirely different kind) and issue the new protein. That's as if we could stick trees into a chipper machine and get a live tree out the other side. Very hi-tech! We're not nearly as hi-tech yet, as our own internal microworld.
>
> We have a great deal to learn from nature. Take economics. If we ran our bodies' economy the way our economy is run it might look something like this. We could call the heart-lung system the “northern industrial organs”. You give them ownership of the bones in which you mine the raw material blood cells that arise in the marrow. Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today. You can see that a living system can't function that way." - [After Darwin, by Elisabet Sahtouris](https://ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/AfterDarwin.html#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20hundred,can%27t%20function%20that%20way.)

> "What kind of competition is there in your body? Suppose your brain said ' I'm the most important organ, and the liver said 'I am, and I want to go in a free enterprise-system.' You would rot away in a month, if every organ of your body, were out for itself." - [Jacque Fresco](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/728466)

> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account." - [Friedrich A. Hayek](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6867865-the-curious-task-of-economics-is-to-demonstrate-to-men)

> "Civilization rests on the fact that we all benefit from knowledge which we do not possess." - [Friedrich A. Hayek](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6539631-civilization-rests-on-the-fact-that-we-all-benefit-from)

Stagnation & optimizing for the wrong thing (GDP)

> "You have as much computing power in your iPhone as was available at the time of the Apollo missions. But what is it being used for? It’s being used to throw angry birds at pigs; it’s being used to send pictures of your cat to people halfway around the world; it’s being used to check in as the virtual mayor of a virtual nowhere while you’re riding a subway from the nineteenth century." - [Peter Thiel](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/720837)

> "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters." - [Peter Thiel](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/697729-we-wanted-flying-cars-instead-we-got-140-characters)



What if radical transparency and cooperation for companies gave them an effectively free marketing budget (they'd be upregulated by the network) and also contributions from everywhere - like with open source? They still price in the labor and input costs, but there's no need for a marketing budget?

What if we made advertising in its current form obsolete? What if false claims were not allowed? What if demand could not be manufactured? What if we had an immune system?

> "As the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decisionmaking and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the “homo economicus” with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a “homo socialis” with other-regarding preferences. While the “homo economicus” optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the “homo socialis” are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. Notably, the “homo socialis” manages to earn higher payoffs than the “homo economicus”.
>
> I show that the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the “homo economicus” (“economics 1.0”), a complementary theory must be developed for the “homo socialis”. This economic theory might be called “economics 2.0” or “socionomics”. The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as “participatory market society”.
>
> To thrive, the “homo socialis” requires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation systems, which will be sketched in this paper. I also propose a new kind of money, so-called “qualified money”, which may overcome some of the problems of our current financial system." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

We need to crowdsource the quantification of how much anything costs

Here’s what the operating system for humanity should enable: state a problem and incentivize someone to solve it. Recursively/iteratively and in parallel - pointing to problems, ranking them, and rewarding for them being solved

We need to move from a money-on-money-return world to a transparency-on-transparency-return world

Capitalism is suffering from opacity

The metaverse is a parallel economy
Parallel media, economy & governance

How do we incentivize companies like Google to spread their know-how about their cafeteria instead of keeping it to themselves?

What if we can reward associating with the right forces so that employees pick their companies that way?

what if not advertisers could buycott platforms, but users could collectively boycott advertisers? What if we reject crap products, ads & ideologies?

Another collective action problem: the right to repair - should stigmatise companies for this

Credentialed expression rights - we should demand that companies give us credentials for this new sensemaking & governance infrastructure

how we should think about wealth distribution and accumulation

Not everything has to make a profit - we can and should think of what truly needs subsidizing and how to make the governance of that process corruption-free and meritocratic.

> "One fundamental difference between American and Oriental culture is the individual’s position in society. In American culture an individual’s interest is primary. This makes American society more aggressively competitive, with a sharper edge and higher performance. In Singapore, the interests of the society take precedence over that of the individual. Nevertheless Singapore has to be competitive in the market for jobs, goods and services. On the other hand the government helps lower income groups to meet their needs for housing, health services and education so that their children will have more of an equal chance to rise through education." - [Lee Kuan Yew](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7289186-one-fundamental-difference-between-american-and-oriental-culture-is-the)

> "Don’t be dogmatic about the government always being good or bad. Don’t think education or healthcare should always be private or always be public. The question is never what philosophy is better.
