As John Maynard Keynes wrote in the conclusion of his General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, “The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed, the world is ruled by little else.”
From John Maynard Keynes’s 1936 The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, ch 24, part V.

# SECTION: Institutions
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

institutions: rules, roles & enforcement of those rules that structure human interaction - including habits, practices & values
examples: markets, marriage, corporations, legal system (also specific courts as specific sub-institution), journalism, higher education, regulatory bodies, etc. - organizations are specific instantiations of institutions
they structure relationships to avoid conflict, avoid opportunistic behavior, etc.
^^ taken from 1 Definition of Institutions in Economics [cxEhWDvJUEg] from ashley from her institutional economics playlist

institutional economics: coordination costs, efficiency, collective action, repeated interaction games, theory, reputation-building, property rights, principal-agent problem, the evolutionary nature of what survives

internal vs external institutions
- enforcement in internal (decentralized): norms, social pressure/judgement/expectations, conventions, habits
- in external (centralized): organizational rules, legal system
internal & external should be compatible - if there's a mismatch there will be problems

search costs in institutional economics:
- matchmaking, labor markets, other markets, opportunity costs
- related: Roland Coase, The nature of the firm

institution vs organization: org has a clear boundry & specific purpose/instantiation & hierarchical/official structure
every org is an institu, but not every institu is an org (eg: marriage, regulatory body (not a specific one), institu of a firm (not a specific one), school, nonprofit, (labor) market, etc. - conceptual ones)
institutions can be nested: K12 => disctrict => specific school

the information paradox: how do u determine if its worth expending scarce resources pursuing information which u don't know how valuable it will be?

3 different types of efficiency: technical (mechanical), economic (within a firm: organizational, social, human beings - not machines) & dynamic (whole economy - higher level of complexity - unpredictable, untestable)

transaction costs: information-gathering, costs of entering a contract, monitoring costs, enforcement costs (could be also time so that the other party follows through with what they promised), exclusion costs
these costs grow and grow as the economy grows more complex and more people are involved, also consultant services around the construction and maintenance of contracts grow

collective property types
                        who owns/manages?       excludable? example
open access property    nobody                  no          lake anyone can use
common property         group of people         yes         common pool, community garden
public property         govt/public officials   yes         city pool, gov building, library

rule types:
prescriptive: dictating necessary action - pay taxes by date X, note why you needed that expense
proscriptive: saying what NOT to do - don't browse youtube on company computer

> "Property rights specify which resources can be owned and by whom and how they can be used" - Harris, 2020
> "A property right is a liberty or a permit to enjoy benefits of wealth - in its broadest sense - while assuming the costs which those benefits entail... It will be observed that property rights, unlike wealth or benefits, are not physical objects nor events, but are abstract social relations." - Fisher, 1922
> "Private property rights always establish a relationship between defined individuals and defined assets, which can be physical goods, ideas or people's own bodies." - Kasper, Streit, & Boettke, 2012

Property rights are a social contract and that makes them an institution
Traits of property rights:
- transferability/inalienability - your right to life is inalienable - you can't transfer it - related to human rights, we can/should make more inalienable reputation
- divisibility
- security of trespassing, exclusion costs
- credibility of persistence...?
- clarity of allocation - does everyone know who owns what? Who owns the fish in this segment of the lake?

"Why isn't economics an evolutionary science?" by Thorstein Veblen 1 century ago
"why not also a thermodynamic, information-theoretic science? A system of free-energy minimization within constraints"

the genius of markets is not necessarily in its efficiency and allocation, but in creating an evolutionary competition for solving human problems

business is about solving human problems, the role of the state is to create the conditions for large-scale cooperation to allow that process to happen. That means:
- promoting inclusion - no large-scale cooperation if excluding large groups of people
- need fair social contract
- institutions that build trust: rule of law, money, regulation
- also need the state to solve collective action problems to grease the wheels of cooperation

In a democratic system people have a right - even a duty - to define the fitness function that the market system is evolving towards.
Social equity, climate change & others are valid social concerns that should be reflected in that market fitness function.

We should worry more about creating a healthy ecology that promotes real tangible improvements in people's lives and less worrying about theoretical trade-offs and efficiency...?
Instead of thinking of markets and states as competitors - think of them as a joint system.
This ecology has lots of different forms of organization, not just markets and states, but a broader zoo of forms.

Dominant ideology: pursuing self-interest is good.
One of the most dangerous ideas in economics: Methodological individualism
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological_individualism
This led to Margaret Thatcher's quote "there's no such thing as society" which leads to one no longer believing that society can act together to handle climate change or other technological challenges.
At the root of this is a confusion between collectivism, which the neoliberals critiqued, quite rightly, versus solving collective-action problems.
One of the big successes of the Enlightenment was the emphasis on individual freedom, individual rights & so on, a huge jump for mankind. But then, taking that to an extreme, we lose sight of our ability to work together to solve collective-action problems.
We have to rediscover ways to create an ideology and system of thought that allows us to tackle existential problems together.

^^ many of the above points have been taken from santa fe economics simposium - have only a screenshot from my phone of the text on my kindle - can't properly attribute now to who said it

M. O. Jackson on our ignorance of what the state does... Part of the problem is ignorance. It's easy to be ignorant of all the things the state does. What if we had an accurate and real-time representation of the budget that we could inspect and try to allocate differently and reason through that - on a national/state/local level and so forth? People need an impression how much goes into each part like roads, K-12 education, etc. You need to see the numbers in order to also see the tradeoffs. People are ignorant of the scope and size of the state. Removing this ignorance is a good step towards more trust & understanding.

E. D. Beinhocker: One big thing that Hayek got right was, in complex social systems predicting the future is a dangerous business. Popper's answer to that challenge was what he called "piecemeal social engineering", so he was very much against Utopianism and kind of big grand plans. But he saw that in the historical records... that you make reforms one step at a time. You sort of march your way forward and you try stuff and not everything works but some stuff does work and you do more of what works and less of what doesn't. That's an evolutionary process. And evolution can grope its way toward whatever goals exist in a complex system. One could argue the three great inventions of the Enlightenment - taking into account the blind spots - were three evolutionary systems: science, which is an evolutionary epistemological system; democracy, which is a kind of evolutionary political system; and markets, which are an evolutionary economic system. But... in recent decades we've had an ideology that has said the only fitness function that matters is the maximization of self-interest and a narrow definition of profits and so on. So, we've had a system that has been adapting to that and giving us the results that we have today. One of the key ways to handle these big challenges is to reinvigorate these evolutionary processes in our society and get them pointed at solving our biggest societal challenges.


> "With 35-45% of U.S. GDP spent by the government, and perhaps another 10% spent by nonprofits, it is possible that a majority of U.S. GDP is spent outside of the market, without regard to market signals or forces. It is perhaps time to rethink what we call this economic system. The web of financial flows making up our society is not one that is greatly defined by the spending of individual billionaires. It is rather less of an intricate, flexible, organic web, and more of a rigid grid taking its shape from various large bureaucratic organizations." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781279198929182)




> "If billionaires are unduly influential by virtue of spending lots of money, then by the same metric the influence of bureaucracies or universities is a behemoth tidal wave. The Pentagon alone spends 4 Elon Musks each year. Billionaire spending is a few drops in the bucket. The U.S. government spends more on kidney dialysis in Medicare ($28B) than it allots to NASA ($25B). More federal money is spent each year on soda and sweetened drinks (~$10.5B) than Elon Musk could spend if he wanted to spend his whole fortune to the last penny before he died." - [Bismarck Analysis](https://x.com/bismarckanlys/status/1840781219727917485)



> "Healthy life grows and becomes looked upon with envy. This is, after all, the only meaning of market capitalization: how much do others want what you have built? But we mustn’t confuse this financial growth for purpose. The purpose of your empire is some higher task that you have built it to accomplish. Its nature is not its market capitalization and financial flows, but the whole system of machinery that gives it a very particular strategic position and animates it towards that particular task. Financial growth is simply one operational constraint among many towards the accomplishment of its visionary ends. Ironically, it is these focused strategic empires that display the best financial performance. But don’t let the venture capitalists confuse you: that is not what is important about them." - [Quit Your Job, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/01/06/quit-your-job/)



> "When people talk about a “market economy”, what exactly does that mean? You might assume it means a society where all or most economic decisions are made through markets. But this does not describe our own economy, or anything else that gets called a “market economy”. Most economic decisions are made inside particular organizations, which make their internal decisions according to hierarchical structures and individual judgment, taking markets into account as one factor among many. If two workers both want to avoid a Monday morning shift, or two department heads are arguing over hiring policy, or two engineers are debating which design to adopt, no one expects the people involved to start setting prices and bidding against each other like they would in a market. And yet markets are nevertheless crucial to our economic organization, in ways that are notably different from non-“market economies”. How, then, does the market fit in?
>
> What markets make possible is smooth interaction between independent units. Organizations have hierarchical control over their own assets, including very complex social processes like medical schools or aircraft control towers, but they also need to coordinate with other parts of society external to the organization itself, like customers and suppliers. Markets make this easy and reliable. The market is a thin layer of crucial but simple social technology that lets an organization ignore the deep complexity of the people and organizations it interacts with. This is helpful because the market interface an organization presents to the outside world is so much simpler than the non-market-based coordination it uses internally.
>
> In a way, the market is like the docking module between the Apollo and Soyuz rockets. It’s a crucial component, and without it the entire system couldn’t possibly function as a unified whole, but it’s still a relatively small fraction of the system’s mass and complexity. Understanding how it works won’t tell you all that much about how the Soyuz itself works." - [Markets Are Thin, by Ben Landau-Taylor](https://www.benlandautaylor.com/p/markets-are-thin#:~:text=When%20people%20talk,Soyuz%20itself%20works.)

It's morally reprehensible that they're not leading the way." - [Geoffrey West](https://twitter.com/sfiscience/status/1193262457566842881)

> "We have a hundred trillion cells in our bodies and each one of them has thirty thousand recycling centres renewing our proteins. They're so hi-tech that they can take in a protein, disassemble it, build a new protein (perhaps an entirely different kind) and issue the new protein. That's as if we could stick trees into a chipper machine and get a live tree out the other side. Very hi-tech! We're not nearly as hi-tech yet, as our own internal microworld.
>
> We have a great deal to learn from nature. Take economics. If we ran our bodies' economy the way our economy is run it might look something like this. We could call the heart-lung system the “northern industrial organs”. You give them ownership of the bones in which you mine the raw material blood cells that arise in the marrow. Sweep them up here to the northern industrial organs. Purify the blood as actually happens. Add oxygen and then the heart distribution centre announces “The body price for blood today is so much. Who will buy?” And you ship the blood to the organs that can afford it and not all can. This is the situation we have economically in the world today. You can see that a living system can't function that way." - [After Darwin, by Elisabet Sahtouris](https://ratical.org/LifeWeb/Articles/AfterDarwin.html#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20hundred,can%27t%20function%20that%20way.)

You would rot away in a month, if every organ of your body, were out for itself." - [Jacque Fresco](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/728466)

> "The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design. To the naive mind that can conceive of order only as the product of deliberate arrangement, it may seem absurd that in complex conditions order, and adaptation to the unknown, can be achieved more effectively by decentralizing decisions and that a division of authority will actually extend the possibility of overall order. Yet that decentralization actually leads to more information being taken into account." - [Friedrich A.

What if radical transparency and cooperation for companies gave them an effectively free marketing budget (they'd be upregulated by the network) and also contributions from everywhere - like with open source? They still price in the labor and input costs, but there's no need for a marketing budget?

What if we made advertising in its current form obsolete? What if false claims were not allowed? What if demand could not be manufactured? What if we had an immune system?

> "AI as the engine, humans as the steering wheel, by Vitalik Buterin
>
> ... an alternative approach that I favor exploring for many use cases is to make a simple mechanism be the rules of the game, and let AIs be the players. This is the same insight that makes markets so effective: the rules are a relatively dumb system of property rights, with edge cases decided by a court system that slowly accumulates and adjusts precedents, and all of the intelligence comes from entrepreneurs operating "at the edge". The individual "game players" can be LLMs, swarms of LLMs interacting with each other and calling into various internet services, various AI + human combinations, and many other constructions; as a mechanism designer, you do not need to know. The ideal goal is to have a mechanism that functions as an automaton - if the goal of the mechanism is choosing what to fund, then it should feel as much as possible like Bitcoin or Ethereum block rewards. The benefits of this approach are:
>
> 1. It avoids enshrining any single model into the mechanism; instead, you get an open market of many different participants and architectures, all with their own different biases. Open models, closed models, agent swarms, human + AI hybrids, cyborgs, infinite monkeys (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem), etc, are all fair game; the mechanism does not discriminate.
>
> 2. The mechanism is open source. While the players are not, the game is - and this is a pattern that is already reasonably well-understood (eg. political parties and markets both work this way)
>
> 3. The mechanism is simple, and so there are relatively few routes for a mechanism designer to encode their own biases into the design
>
> 4. The mechanism does not change, even if the architecture of the underlying players will need to be redesigned every three months from here until the singularity.
>
> The goal of the steering mechanism is to provide a faithful representation of the participants' underlying goals. It only needs to provide a small amount of information, but it should be high-quality information. You can think of the mechanism as exploiting an asymmetry between coming up with an answer and verifying the answer. This is similar to how a sudoku is difficult to solve, but it's easy to verify that a solution is correct. You (i) create an open market of players to act as "solvers", and then (ii) maintain a human-run mechanism that performs the much simpler task of verifying solutions that have been presented.
>
> Futarchy
>
> Futarchy was originally introduced by Robin Hanson as "vote values, but bet beliefs (https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html)". A voting mechanism chooses a set of goals (which can be anything, with the caveat that they need to be measurable) which get combined into a metric M. When you need to make a decision (for simplicity, let's say it's YES/NO), you set up conditional markets: you ask people to bet on (i) whether YES or NO will be chosen, (ii) value of M if YES is chosen, otherwise zero, (iii) value of M if NO is chosen, otherwise zero. Given these three variables, you can figure out if the market thinks YES or NO is more bullish for the value of M. "Price of the company share" (or, for a cryptocurrency, a token) is the most commonly cited metric, because it's so easy to understand and measure, but the mechanism can support many kinds of metrics: monthly active users, median self-reported happiness of some group of constituents, some quantifiable measure of decentralization, etc. Futarchy was originally invented in the pre-AI era. However, futarchy fits very naturally in the "sophisticated solver, easy verifier" paradigm described in the previous section, and traders in a futarchy can be AI (or human+AI combinations) too. The role of the "solvers" (prediction market traders) is to determine how each proposed plan will affect the value of a metric in the future. This is hard. The solvers make money if they are right, and lose money if they are wrong. The verifiers (the people voting on the metric, adjusting the metric if they notice that it is being "gamed" or is otherwise becoming outdated, and determining the actual value of the metric at some future time) need only answer the simpler question "what is the value of the metric now?"

> You have a jury that can answer such questions, though at the cost of spending a lot of effort on each answer. You ask the jury to only a small number of the questions (eg. if the total list has 1 million items, the jury perhaps only provides answers on 100 of them). You can even ask the jury indirect questions: instead of asking "what percent of total credit does Alice deserve?", you can ask "does Alice or Bob deserve more credit, and how many times more?". When designing the jury mechanism, you can reuse time-tested mechanisms from the real world like grants committees, courts (determining value of a judgement), appraisals, etc, though of course the jury participants are themselves welcome to use new-fangled AI research tools to help them come to an answer. You then allow anyone to submit a list of numerical responses to the entire set of questions (eg. providing an estimate for how much credit each participant in the entire list deserves). Participants are encouraged to use AI to do this, though they can use any technique: AI, human-AI hybrid, AI with access to internet search and the ability to autonomously hire other human or AI workers, cybernetically enhanced monkeys, etc. Once the full-list providers and the jurors have both submitted their answers, the full lists are checked against the jury answers, and some combination of the full lists that are most compatible with the jury answers is taken as the final answer. The distilled human judgement mechanism is different from futarchy, but has some important similarities:
>
> 1. In futarchy, the "solvers" are making predictions, and the "ground-truth data" that their predictions get checked against (to reward or penalize solvers) is the oracle that outputs the value of the metric, which is run by the jury.
>
> 2. In distilled human judgement, the "solvers" are providing answers to a very large quantity of questions, and the "ground-truth data" that their predictions get checked against is high-quality answers to a small subset of those questions, provided by a jury.
>
> The "humans as a steering wheel" aspect in this "defeating Sauron" example is reflected in two places. First, there is high-quality human judgement being applied on each individual question, though this is still leveraging the jury as "technocratic" evaluators of performance. Second, there is an implied voting mechanism that determines if "defeating Sauron" is even the right goal (as opposed to, say, trying to ally with him, or offering him all the territory east of some critical river as a concession for peace). There are other distilled human judgement use cases where the jury task is more directly values-laden: for example, imagine a decentralized social media platform (or sub-community) where the jury's job is to label randomly selected forum posts as following or not following the community's rules. There are a few open variables within the distilled human judgement paradigm:
>
> 1. How do you do the sampling? The role of the full list submitters is to provide a large quantity of answers; the role of the jurors is to provide high-quality answers. We need to choose jurors, and choose questions for jurors, in such a way that a model's ability to match jurors' answers is maximally indicative of its performance in general...
>
> 2. What scoring function do you use?... This is to show that there is a rich design space of scoring functions, and the choice of scoring functions is connected to the choice of which questions you ask the jurors.
>
> 3. How do you reward the full list submitters? Ideally, you want to often give multiple participants a nonzero reward, to avoid monopolization of the mechanism, but you also want to satisfy the property that an actor cannot increase their reward by submitting the same (or slightly modified) set of answers many times. One promising approach is to directly compute the linear combination (with coefficients non-negative and summing to 1) of full lists that best fits the jury answers, and use those same coefficients to split rewards. There could also be other approaches.
>
> In general, the goal is to take human judgement mechanisms that are known to be effective and bias-minimizing and have stood the test of time (eg. think of how the adversarial structure of a court system includes both the two parties to a dispute, who have high information but are biased, and a judge, who has low information but is probably unbiased), and use an open market of AIs as a reasonably high-fidelity and very low-cost predictor of these mechanisms (this is similar to how "distillation" of LLMs works).

>
> Deep funding is the application of distilled human judgement to the problem of filling in the weights of edges on a graph representing "what percent of the credit for X belongs to Y?" ... This approach is designed to work in domains where work is built on top of previous work and the structure of this is highly legible. Academia (think: citation graphs) and open source software (think: library dependencies and forking) are two natural examples. The goal of a well-functioning deep funding system would be to create and maintain a global graph, where any funder that is interested in supporting one particular project would be able to send funds to an address representing that node, and funds would automatically propagate to its dependencies (and recursively to their dependencies etc) based on the weights on the edges of the graph. You could imagine a decentralized protocol using a built-in deep funding gadget to issue its token: some in-protocol decentralized governance would choose a jury, and the jury would run the deep funding mechanism, as the protocol automatically issues tokens and deposits them into the node corresponding to itself. By doing so, the protocol rewards all of its direct and indirect contributors in a programmatic way reminiscent of how Bitcoin or Ethereum block rewards rewarded one specific type of contributor (miners). By influencing the weights of the edges, the jury gets a way to continuously define what types of contributions it values...

> Designs like this have a number of promising benefits. By far the most important one is that they allow for the construction of DAOs where human voters are in control of setting the direction, but they are not overwhelmed with an excessively large number of decisions to make. They hit the happy medium where each person doesn't have to make N decisions, but they have more power than just making one decision (how delegation typically works), and in a way that is more capable of eliciting rich preferences that are difficult to express directly. Additionally, mechanisms like this seem to have an incentive smoothing property. What I mean here by "incentive smoothing" is a combination of two factors:
>
> 1. Diffusion: no single action that the voting mechanism takes has an overly large impact on the interests of any one single actor.
>
> 2. Confusion: the connection between voting decisions and how they affect actors' interests is more complex and difficult to compute.
>
> The terms confusion and diffusion here are taken from cryptography (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_and_diffusion), where they are key properties of what makes ciphers and hash functions secure.
>
> A good example of incentive smoothing in the real world today is the rule of law: the top level of the government does not regularly take actions of the form "give Alice's company $200M", "fine Bob's company $100M", etc, rather it passes rules that are intended to apply evenly to large sets of actors, which then get interpreted by a separate class of actors. When this works, the benefit is that it greatly reduces the benefits of bribery and other forms of corruption. And when it's violated (as it often is in practice), those issues quickly become greatly magnified. AI is clearly going to be a very large part of the future, and this will inevitably include being a large part of the future of governance. However, if you are involving AI in governance, this has obvious risks: AI has biases, it could be intentionally corrupted during the training process, and AI technology is evolving so quickly that "putting an AI in charge" may well realistically mean "putting whoever is responsible for upgrading the AI in charge". Distilled human judgement offers an alternative path forward, which lets us harness the power of AI in an open free-market way while keeping a human-run democracy in control." - [AI as the engine, humans as the steering wheel, by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/02/28/aihumans.html)

^^ this is a really important piece - goes (mostly) into the new forms of accounting, DHJ (distilled human judgement) is very similar to Universal Basic Recognition / credit, Deep Funding is an epic concept which I've been already thinking a lot about!

It is as common now as ever for a person with access to powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable to reach the public and use it to enhance their own reputation... Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the rightful owner of it and is theft.

How much legislature and bureaucracy can be replaced simply by norms, culture, stigma and reputation? Humanity operated like that for thousands of years

- "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion",
- the number of workers within public administration, bureaucracy or officialdom tends to grow, regardless of the amount of work to be done. This was attributed mainly to two factors: that officials want subordinates, not rivals, and that officials make work for each other.


> "This paper proposes self-organization as a method to improve the efficiency and adaptability of bureaucracies and similar social systems. Bureaucracies are described as networks of agents, where the main design principle is to reduce local “friction” to increase local and global “satisfaction”. Following this principle, solutions are proposed for improving communication within bureaucracies, sensing public satisfaction, dynamic modification of hierarchies, and contextualization of procedures. Each of these reduces friction between agents (internal or external), increasing the efficiency of bureaucracies." - [Towards Self-organizing Bureaucracies, by Carlos Gershenson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0603045.pdf)

> "Bureaucracies can be found in governments, corporations, and other social institutions. They have social goals and responsibilities that are achieved by a division of labor that is usually hierarchical. Examples of bureaucracies can be seen with tax collection systems, immigration services, and steering of educational and academic institutions. The efficiency of a bureaucracy is related to the fulfillment of its goals. Thus, it would be desirable to increase functional efficiency in bureaucracies. Ideally, such a system could be designed to reach maximal efficiency." - [Towards Self-organizing Bureaucracies, by Carlos Gershenson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0603045.pdf)

Many companies go through bureaucracy-clearing exercises only to find it has sprung back a few years later. No one ever sits down to deliberately design a bureaucratic muddle. Instead, bureaucracy springs up as people just try to optimize their local patch of the network: finance is just trying to ensure that the numbers add up, legal wants to keep us out of jail, and marketing is trying to promote the brand. The problem isn't dumb people or evil intentions. Rather, network growth creates interdependencies, interdependencies create conflicting constraints, and conflicting constraints create slow decision making and, ultimately, bureaucratic gridlock." - [Eric D.

> "As the complexity of socio-economic systems increases, networked decisionmaking and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more important features. It will be explained why, besides the “homo economicus” with strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a “homo socialis” with other-regarding preferences. While the “homo economicus” optimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the “homo socialis” are self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. Notably, the “homo socialis” manages to earn higher payoffs than the “homo economicus”.
>
> I show that the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” imply a different kind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the traditional economics for the “homo economicus” (“economics 1.0”), a complementary theory must be developed for the “homo socialis”. This economic theory might be called “economics 2.0” or “socionomics”. The names are justified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new market organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be characterized as “participatory market society”.
>
> To thrive, the “homo socialis” requires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation systems, which will be sketched in this paper. I also propose a new kind of money, so-called “qualified money”, which may overcome some of the problems of our current financial system." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In the past, societies have invented various institutions to overcome “tragedies of the commons”, for example, genetic favoritism, direct reciprocity (“I help you, if you help me”), or punitive institutions (such as police, courts, prisons and regulatory authorities). However, all of these mechanisms can lead to undesirable side effects such as civil wars or corruption. Our current system is built on punitive institutions, but such top-down regulation is very costly and creates many inefficiencies, including negative impacts on innovation." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In the situation studied above, where everyone starts as a defecting “homo economicus”, no single individual can establish profitable cooperation, not even by optimizing decisions over an infinitely long time horizon. It takes a few “friendly” deviations to trigger cascade effects that eventually change the macro-level outcome. Therefore, it is important to recognize that a critical number of interacting individuals need to be friendly and cooperative by coincidence. The “homo socialis” would never evolve without the occurrence of random “mistakes” (here: the birth of “idealists” who are exploited by everyone). However, given suitable feedback effects, such “errors” enable better outcomes. Here, they eventually overcome the “tragedy of the commons” (Hardin, 1968), resulting in an “upward spiral” towards cooperation with high payoffs. Remarkably, this is not the outcome of an optimization process, but rather of an evolutionary process.
>
> ... In accordance with a lot of work in social psychology, the “homo socialis” may be characterized by “empathy” in the sense that the “homo socialis” puts himself or herself into the shoes of others. More precisely, the “homo socialis” takes into account the perspective, interests, and success of others when taking own decisions.17 This effectively explains the fairness preference observed in behavioral economics (G¨uth et al., 1982; Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Henrich et al., 2001; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003). Note, however, that the “homo socialis” should not be imagined as a “homo economicus” sharing some payoff with others. The “homo socialis” decides differently from the “homo economicus”, and that is why “tragedies of the commons” can be overcome.
>
> Decisions of the “homo socialis” are interdependent, in contrast to the “homo economicus”, who takes decisions indendently without the consideration of effects on others. Therefore, the “homo socialis” may be characterized by the term “networked minds”. This implies a complex dynamics of systems where many such decision-makers interact, with important economic implications (Helbing and Kirman, 2013). While methods from statistics should be good enough to characterize the “homo economicus”, the description of the “homo socialis” requires methods drawn from complexity science." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

> "In other words, in social dilemma situations, Adam Smith’s principle of the “invisible hand” works only for the “homo socialis”, but not for the “homo economicus”. Without suitable institutional settings or regulations, the “homo economicus” will run into a “tragedy of the commons” with very poor payoffs for the great majority. Note that the principle of the “invisible hand” would work for the “homo economicus” as well, if the underlying assumptions of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics were fulfilled, i.e. if all individuals would interact in one shared market without transaction costs and externalities (Arrow and Debreu, 1954; Debreu, 1959). However, these assumptions are quite restrictive, and the macro-level outcome depends on them in a sensitive manner...
>
> As the “homo economicus” decides strictly according to self-interest, the coordination of decisionmakers and efforts to overcome “tragedies of the commons” or market failures requires some kind of top-down regulation. This results in a steadily growing number of laws and regulations and costly investments into regulatory and sanctioning institutions (such as police, courts, market regulators, etc.). This can significantly decrease systemic efficiency. In addition, regulation tends to reduce diversity, which can affect innovation in a negative way.
>
> In comparison with the “homo economicus”, the “homo socialis” is able to cope with social dilemma situations based on local interactions. I will characterize this as bottom-up self-regulation, considering that the emergent level of “friendliness” overcoming the “tragedy of the commons” results from a decentralized, evolutionary process. Since top-down regulation (as required for the “homo economicus”) is just the opposite of bottom-up self-regulation (as typical for the “homo socialis”), it is misleading to say that the “homo socialis” is just a variant of the “homo economicus” or vice versa. Speaking metaphorically, the “homo economicus” and the “homo socialis” must be distinguished like night and day. This is mainly due to the discontinuous transition in the systemic outcome when the “friendliness” increases beyond a certain critical level (“tipping point”). Passing the tipping point is like switching the light on or off, with dramatic impacts on the average payoff.

It is important to note that our understanding of socionomics does not assume emotionally or irrationally acting agents. In the simulations underlying Figs. 1 and 2, the “homo socialis” decides rationally, trying to optimize the individual utility, but this utility also reflects the externalities of others. In social dilemma situations, the “homo socialis” can outperform the “homo economicus” through reaching higher payoffs.

> Figure 5: Table highlighting the differences between the nature of a central planner, the “homo economicus”, and the “homo socialis”, including their different system dynamics and systemic outcomes. The First Theorem of Welfare Economics(Arrow and Debreu, 1954; Debreu, 1959), which states that competitive markets lead to an efficient allocation of resources, only holds if there is a complete set of markets and all market participants are price-takers, and there are neither externalities nor transaction costs. As conventional market economies tend to create negative externalities, top-down regulation by a strong state is needed to counter related market failures. Examples of negative externalities are resource depletion and environmental pollution, which eventually lead to the creation of regulatory institutions such as the emission trading scheme or financial regulatory authorities. As regulation tends to be costly for regulators and regulated agents, bottom-up self-regulation is expected to unleash large creative potentials of “networked minds”, which are currently not fully used (see Sec. 7). The performance gains may well be comparable to the gains when moving from a top-down regulation to a conventional market economy building on self-organization (see Sec. 5.1). “Socionomies” (also called “economies 2.0” or “participatory market societies”), are characterized by high levels of cooperation, established through self-regulation. To protect a “homo socialis” from being exploited, it is important to know whether one is interacting with another “homo socialis” or a “homo economicus”. Therefore, suitable institutions such as reputation mechanisms need to be established, which allow like-minded agents to interact successfully, and differently minded agents to cope with each other. Examples for socionomic systems are Wikipedia, Open Streetmap, open source software communities (such as Linux or GitHub), and social media platforms. Note that the “homo socialis” should not be confused with someone, who is redistributing gains. A redistribution strategy (via donations, or taxes and social benefit systems) might be able to “heal” or reduce problems such as an “unhealthy” degree of inequality, but it would usually not be able to avoid or overcome “tragedies of the commons”. Hence, redistribution is inefficient and often not a suitable solution for social dilemma situations (see also footnote 27). The main difference to the “homo economicus” is that the “homo socialis” decides more “responsibly” or “wisely”, considering not only the own interests, but also those of others when taking self-determined decisions. If enough people do this, other-regarding preferences pays off.

> In conclusion, a central regulator fails to be efficient for lack of computational capacity, which is required to handle the algorithmic complexity of a NP-hard optimization problem within large system in real-time. Applying the principle of the “homo economicus” on a local level, fails due to lack of coordination. In contrast, the approach of the other-regarding “homo socialis” can overcome both problems by combining self-organization with self-regulation. A self-regulation based on suitable local interactions can produce resource-efficient solutions delivering high system performance.23 These solutions also tend to be resilient to perturbations (such as accidents, road works, etc.). Again, the “homo socialis” can make the principle of the “invisible hand” work under conditions, where it fails for the independent optimization attempts of a “homo economicus” (see Fig. 7). Many of the above conclusions also seem to be relevant for socio-economic systems, when agents have incompatible interests that cannot be satisfied at the same time." - [Economics 2.0: The Natural Step towards A Self-Regulating, Participatory Market Society, by Dirk Helbing](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4078)

We need to crowdsource the quantification of how much anything costs

Here’s what the operating system for humanity should enable: state a problem and incentivize someone to solve it. Recursively/iteratively and in parallel - pointing to problems, ranking them, and rewarding for them being solved

We need to move from a money-on-money-return world to a transparency-on-transparency-return world

Capitalism is suffering from opacity

The metaverse is a parallel economy
Parallel media, economy & governance

Laissez-faire capitalism needs to end
We're in a free for all and that should scare everybody

The invisible hand has no competition - it’s left unchecked and is ripping meaning and morals out of our civilization. If you truly care about competition we should introduce it at the most fundamental level and give rise to another invisible hand that’s not fungible to material possessions but is all about the meaning of life and recognition by and connection to others.
We need a meta-invisible hand that will tune the relationship and distribution of money (claims over resources) and human values



the biggest harms in the world come from opaqueness on the enterprise level

We have to incentivise contribution to the common good and we have to decouple that from resources - we need a new incentive

The completely open global do-it-all company

A publicly run parallel socioeconomic system embedded within the current one - parasitizing it from within

We need to make a single coherent company for everyone for everything - we need to reduce the costs of cooperation and define the protocols for status and redistribution

The most meta-economic thing to do is to incentivize the truth bubble up

The most important thing to compute is the most optimal way to cooperate and coordinate.

> "But until a theoretical explanation -based on human choice – for self-organized and self-governed enterprises is fully developed and accepted, major policy decisions will continue to be undertaken with a presumption that individuals cannot organize themselves and always need to be organized by external authorities." - [Elinor Ostrom](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3238607-but-until-a-theoretical-explanation--based-on-human-choice)

> "Only when science and technology are used with human concern in a world in which all of the earth's resources are held as the common heritage of all of the earth's people can we truly say that there is intelligent life on Earth." - [Jacque Fresco](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/728558)


> "In Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom set out to articulate how the ‘state/market’ could be broken with a ‘radical third’ of a commons as ‘institutions for collective action’ with a specific focus on their establishment and management. In other words, instead of systems controlling property and labour (nation-states), or systems producing and consuming commodities (markets), the commons are systems for managing and distributing shared resources and spaces with a core of direct democracy (as opposed to representative democracy). For Ostrom, one of the key notions for the successful establishment and maintenance of a commons based on access is how these systems identify and properly manage ‘Common Pool Resources’ (CPR), which she identifies as resources and spaces that are inherently ‘common’ but also ‘scarce’ and thus ‘rival’. In other words, overcoming the problem of establishing and managing CPRs in a commons is the foundation for ‘de-commodification’ and ‘opening a commonwealth’, and perhaps, the key shift in transforming neoliberal institutions (and the multinational corporations that thrive under their reign) into commons institutions capable of establishing an automated and collaborative commons.
>
> In this frame a resource/space an be generally defined as a CPR if one agent/persons use of the resource/space will subtract from any other agent/persons use and where it is often necessary, but difficult and costly, to exclude another agent/persons use outside the group from using the resource/space. Here there are numerous and extremely diverse examples of such ‘rival/scarce’ resources/spaces that could be classified as a ‘CPR’: fishers, grazing grounds, parks, farms, transportation grids, and so forth. In Ostrom’s analysis of systems for collective action that benefit the common good (i.e. higher levels of cooperation) there are always simple yet fundamental problems related to (Ostrom 1990, p. 27):
>
> A) Coping with free-riding
>
> B) Solving commitment problems
>
> C) Arranging for the supply of new institutions, and
>
> D) Monitoring individual compliance with sets of rules
>
> Furthermore, Ostrom did not just identify the problems that prevent the emergence and stabilization of commons institutions for collective action, but also identified key ‘design principles’ that can solve these problems, which include (Ostrom 1990, p. 90):
>
> A) Group boundaries clearly defined
>
> B) Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions
>
> C) Most individuals affected by these rules can participate in modifying the rules
>
> D) The rights of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
>
> E) A system for monitoring member’s behaviour exists; the community members themselves undertake this monitoring
>
> F) A graduate system of sanctions is used
>
> G) Community members have access to low-cost conflict resolution mechanisms
>
> H) For CPRs that are parts of larger systems: appropriation, provision, monitoring, enforcement, conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized in multiple layers of nested enterprises
>
> The first thing for GB theorists to note here is the difficulty in understanding and implementing the relation between the ‘local’ dimension and the ‘global’ dimension. In other words, although both the automated and collaborative functions of the commons would ideally fall within a universal medium that intelligently satisfied all human necessities - some form of ‘post- monetary’ ‘offer network’ (Goertzel 2015; Heylighen 2016b) - this universal medium must also be nested in order to meet CPR demands on multiple interacting levels, e.g. regional, continental, international and global. On the practical level there are functions of human civilization that operate on different levels of organization, e.g. regional health facilities require different commons demands than do international transportation networks or global environmental problems, etc. But on the second societal and cultural level there is the simple fact that real groups and communities exist at multiple levels with specific needs and desires that cannot be totally ignored and replaced with a totalizing and ideological abstract universalism (i.e. ‘We are all One world community, and so forth’). Thus, the point of Ostrom’s commons ‘design principles’ is that, although they complicate the situation of establishing and maintaining a commons, they are at the same time necessary preconditions for the commons long-term viability as well the growth of pluralism and diversity within a new universal level of organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "You may think that tax policy sounds like the most boring topic in the world. That is precisely what most governments, corporations, and special interests would like you to think, because tax policy is where much of society and the economy gets shaped. It is also where well-informed citizens can achieve socioeconomic revolutions with astonishing speed and effectiveness—but only if they realize how much power they might wield in this domain. If citizens don’t understand taxes, they don’t understand how, when, and where their government expropriates money, time, and freedom from their lives. They also don’t understand how most governments bias consumption over savings, and bias some forms of consumption over other forms, thereby distorting the trait-display systems that people might otherwise favor." - [Geoffrey Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7213268-you-may-think-that-tax-policy-sounds-like-the-most)

> "Thus, consumption taxes tend to reduce conspicuous consumption and promote longer-term retirement security, family wealth, social welfare, technical progress, and economic growth. In essence, income taxes penalize people for what they contribute to society (labor and capital), whereas consumption taxes penalize people for what they take out of society (new retail purchases).

> "And so, Rawls argues, the bargainers in the original position will pick principles of justice that allow inequality, provided inequality causes everyone to get a bigger slice. The bargainers realize that by rewarding certain people for being unusually productive or talented, everyone can be better off. It is to everyone’s advantage to live by rules under which a Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett can accumulate more wealth than less talented, ambitious, or conscientious people. Once we realize that the size of the pie depends upon people making that pie, we want to encourage pie-making.

> "From surplus above subsistence, we get the whole mass of profits, savings, investment, and consumption of luxury commodities. In capitalism, ownership of this surplus, much of which is spent on luxury, has been used as an incentive to increase production and boost growth; it is what encourages investors to invest, savers to save, and landlords to rent. The disproportionate power of billionaires and the effort of those who aspire to such levels of wealth is this incentive in action. But like all things in economics, this incentive is a tradeoff. There are costs to this luxurious incentive mechanism: the production costs of the luxury goods themselves, the free time afforded to those who have secured the means of their substance without labor, the redundancies of production demanded by market competition and consumer choice, the power and talent directed into the zero-sum games in the financial industry which must manage this accumulated wealth, and the speculative bubbles which naturally result from such accumulation." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

Those moments where social reproduction totally breaks down are the object of fear for civilization itself: plagues, wars, famines, and general economic and political collapse." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "It’s often been declared that the USSR fell because it failed to innovate, or that the planning system couldn’t adequately allocate capital and resources without price signals. But this explanation is more drawn from the theoretical logic of markets than on studying the actual history of the country. In reality, the USSR had one of the best-educated populations in the world, and scientists who produced many cutting-edge advancements. But there is an important distinction between scientific innovation and innovation in the production process. That distinction makes it clear why a tradeoff exists, and just why incentive systems matter.
>
> While Soviet scientists did innovate in technology, there was no incentive to implement innovations in the production process. Enterprises would reject using the latest, most efficient machines because doing so would mean fewer resources allocated to the enterprise, which would mean less power and wealth for the managers and bureaucrats in charge of it—not to mention, for those they could bribe. More efficiency meant that an enterprise could make do with less, and therefore the planners would ratchet back those resources. This led to systemic hoarding.
>
> Soviet planners, while always in a battle with enterprises for accurate statistics, were generally good at allocating capital and labor to high productivity sectors of the economy. This was how the USSR was able to achieve such high growth up until its stagnation in the 70s. But after the easy gains of industrialization were won, the tendency against changes to the plan won out. The more changes that were proposed, the more computational adjustments would be required, and the more mistakes became possible. This is where focusing on necessity alone can go awry.
>
> The economic plan could secure the necessities of social reproduction, but the incentives to use surplus production for growth existed on paper only. The flaw in the Soviet system was that the mere existence of surplus does not necessarily imply growth. A society can maintain the same level of surplus by simply consuming or squandering all surplus beyond what is required to replace existing capital stocks. This is what happened in the USSR but in a very unusual way. The planners were well aware of the need to implement new innovations to grow, and allocated some 25-35% of GDP towards investment (the all-time U.S. high in the postwar period is roughly 20%). But because much of this investment was not utilized, it was merely consuming surplus. Hence, the stagnation of the late USSR.
>
> But take careful note: social reproduction as such did not break down until there was an attempt to transition towards more liberal, market-based institutions. The severe depression was not directly caused by the failures of Soviet economic planning, but by the breakdown of social institutions and the systemic theft of formerly state-owned enterprises by Russia’s rising oligarchs. It was only when the planning system was replaced by an incentive system that demanded a much higher level of immediate luxury for the oligarchs that society could no longer hold together. An economic system that lacks growth may be maladapted for great power competition and economic development, but one which ignores the requirements for social reproduction will fail spectacularly in both the short and long term." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "We live in a world characterized by big numbers and non-linear systems. Don’t let civilization and all its technological and moral trappings fool you; the threats presented by our own growth are just as existential as those faced by our ancestors. We have never been above nature; we will never escape our war with her." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

> "Much can be imagined, given the will to see surplus as something to be allocated strategically, and see beyond luxury as the sole motivation for production. This new kind of austerity regime would make certain goods more expensive in the short-term as well as put downward pressure on profits. That is the price we would have to pay. Economics is about trade-offs, after all. But it also comes with its own luxuries for normal people, those who are essential for the reproduction of our society. Job security, healthcare, and education, which have increasingly become essentials for reproduction of our society, could cease to be treated as privileges. But such a program would require the development of a state consciousness among the powerful quasi-governing segments of American society that currently conceive of themselves as private actors without public duty. Without a change in consciousness, to see that their interests are intimately tied to the public interest, they may find themselves more comfortable with the continued decline of American civilization. To those concerned with its preservation, among the elite and in the general population, there can be nothing more misguided than the clutching at private wants against public needs with such pathological drive." - [The Luxuries We Can No Longer Afford, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/24/the-luxuries-we-can-no-longer-afford/)

TODO: quotes

Aquinas (mid-thirteenth century): Honour is the greatest good among external goods.
(Aquinas 1958: Index 156)

Thomas Hobbes (1642): Few except those who love praise do anything to deserve it.
(Hobbes 1998: 23)

John Locke (1678) The principal spring from which the actions of men take their rise, the
rule they conduct them by, and the end to which they direct them, seems to be credit
and reputation, and that which at any rate they avoid, is in the greatest part shame and
disgrace. (Locke 1993: 236)

Kant (1786): A craving to inspire in others esteem for ourselves, through good behaviour
(repression of that which could arouse in them a poor opinion of us) is the real
basis of all true sociality. (Lovejoy 1961: 193)

John Adams (1790): no appetite in human nature is more universal than that for honor.
(Adams 1973: 51)



> "The three ruling passions in human life are often said to be the desire for property, the desire for power, and the desire for prestige or status or esteem. The eVects of the Wrst desire are charted in standard economics, the eVects of the second in political science—and of course in the annals of history. But the eVects of the desire for esteem have escaped the sustained attention of social scientists. It is almost as if there were a conspiracy not to register or document the fact that we are, and always have been, an honour-hungry species." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "What economics and politics reveal in the domain of property and power is that the unintended consequences of people’s desires congeal into aggregate patterns that affect in turn what individuals can and choose to do. The competition for property dictates the prices at which individual goods can be obtained, for example, while the competition for power dictates the opportunities for individuals to find a place among others and to exercise influence. Both disciplines, however, have a normative as well as a positive or empirical side. They not only seek to reveal how things actually turn out as a result of people’s interactions, but also try to identify ways in which they might be made to turn out better. Thus economics specialises in identifying more efficient systems of production and distribution, politics in charting more stable ways of organising the dispensation whereby power is allocated among individuals and groups. And specialists in each discipline equally argue for improvements that would have beneficial consequences, not just for endogenous ideals like efficiency and stability, but also for ideals—perhaps more controversial ideals—like freedom, community, and equality.
>
> We see no reason why there shouldn’t be a study that serves these same positive and normative ends in regard to the system generated by people’s desire for esteem. Were it distinct enough to earn a Greek name on a par with ‘economics’ and ‘politics’, we might call it ‘kudonomics’: the study of the laws governing the system of kudos or renown... There is an economy in property, an economy in power, and there is also, so we believe, an economy in esteem." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Economies are systems whereby scarce resources are allocated among competing parties. In particular, they are systems of allocation that have an interactive or aggregative dimension. What individual agents do gives rise to aggregate patterns that feed back in turn into the things that determine what individual agents do; they feed back, for example, into the determination of people’s opportunities and expectations. This more or less standard account of an economy is completely general, abstracting from the sorts of resources that are allocated...
>
> Our aim in this book is to look at the scope for studying, in the manner of an economics, the system whereby perhaps the most important resource of this attitudinal kind—esteem—is allocated among individuals...
>
> Esteem cannot be given away or traded in the ordinary manner, for there is no way that I can buy the good opinion of another or sell to others my good opinion of them... But though it is non-tradable in that sense, esteem is still a good that is allocated in society according to more or less systematic determinants; and it is a good whose allocation has an interactive, aggregative aspect. Thus there is room, at least on the face of it, for studying both the positive results of that emerging pattern and the normative prospects for changing that pattern in a way that is generally beneficial." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Some economists will say that esteem is taken into account in standard theory to the extent that reputation—say, the reputation for delivering on time or for delivering at a certain level of quality—is seen as an important resource for someone in the market. But reputation is distinct from esteem in our sense. Esteem may accrue to someone who is not reidentifiable—someone who lacks a recognisable name or face—whereas reputation presupposes reidentifiability. And the two notions come apart even where reidentifiability is assumed...
>
> The tendency among economists who discuss the value of reputation is to see it as deriving entirely from the value of the commodities it enables an agent to secure. Like money, esteem is taken to give an agent a certain purchasing power in the domain of consumption goods—an expectation of being able to use it to obtain such goods—and that is assumed to be the reason it is attractive. We do not think that this reductionist view of market reputation carries over to esteem more generally. We seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among people we are very unlikely to meet again; we even seek esteem or shrink from disesteem among those who will live after our time and whom we will never meet. It is hard to see how this could make sense if esteem had no value for us other than as a means of securing consumption goods." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "The economics of any system of allocation tries not just to understand the system, as mentioned, but also to see how far it can be made to work better and to work for the better promotion of what is regarded as the common good. It constitutes a normative as well as a positive economics. And there is enormous scope, it turns out, for exploring the normative potential of the economy of esteem.
>
> It is common nowadays to think that there are only two reliable controls available for ensuring that people will act in a manner that conduces to the common good: the one is the invisible hand of the market, the other the iron hand of law and administration—the iron hand of the state... Governments have tried to market more and more of the services that used to be provided in the non-marketed sector of the economy—services in education, research, health, counselling, and the like. And, where marketing is impossible or problematic, they have sought to impose a tougher regime of monitoring and management: they have tried to subject those providing the services to ever more intrusive forms of surveillance and accounting.
>
> We think that this dichotomous picture of regulatory possibilities is misconceived. In particular, we think that it overlooks the possibility of subjecting people to a quite different sort of discipline: that involved in being required to act so as to secure esteem and escape disesteem. We think of this discipline as an intangible hand that complements the invisible and iron hands that have monopolised the attention of regulators. The forces of esteem are distinctively associated, not with the market, and not with the state, but with what is nowadays often described as civil society. One of the most interesting projects in institutional design is to investigate the conditions under which the intangible hand can be expected to work well and, in particular, to work for the production of what is generally seen as the common good.
>
> The distinction between the iron hand, the invisible hand, and the intangible hand is analytically well grounded. The iron hand involves actions that intentionally sanction agents—reward or punish them—so that they behave in a certain way; it is represented, for example, in the legal and regulatory initiatives of the state. The invisible hand also involves actions that serve to sanction agents—for example, the actions of consumers in seeking out the cheapest provider of a certain good—but those actions are not designed intentionally to elicit a certain pattern of behaviour, such as competitive pricing; they serve as rewards and penalties that elicit that pattern but they are not necessarily intended by their agents in that role. The intangible hand is like the invisible hand, and unlike the iron hand, in deploying non-intentional sanctions of this kind. But it is unlike the invisible hand, in that the sanctions deployed involve the formation of attitudes—rewards of esteem, penalties of disesteem—not, or at least not necessarily, the performance of actions." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Adam Smith, the founder of economics, was himself a great believer in the attraction that people feel for esteem, and the repulsion that they feel for disesteem. ‘Nature, when she formed man for society’, he wrote, ‘endowed him with an original desire to please, and an original aversion to offend his brethren. She taught him to feel pleasure in their favourable, and pain in their unfavourable regard’. In adopting this view, Smith was following a tradition of emphasis on the importance of the esteem motive that had been present in Western thought in the time of the Greeks and the Romans, had resurfaced with emphasis in the Renaissance, and had become a major theme in the moral and social treatises of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries...
>
> The belief in the power of esteem led Smith even to argue that the reason why we seek out wealth, the reason why we want to have more and more to spend on what he called baubles and trinkets, is that by achieving conspicuousness in such possessions, we win distinction and esteem. ‘It is the vanity, not the ease or the pleasure, which interests us’. Writing in 1790, John Adams gave nice expression to the same idea. ‘Riches force the opinion on a man that he is the object of the congratulations of others; and he feels that they attract the complaisance of the public.’
>
> But this view that it is an interest in esteem that fuels the desire for material goods and services largely disappeared with the development of mainstream economics...
>
> We can think of three main reasons why esteem may have slipped out of focus among economists and social scientists in the two centuries since Smith wrote his path-breaking books. One is that with the advent of economics, in particular with the discovery of invisible-hand possibilities of social ordering, it became unfashionable to give attention to any mode of social discipline that invoked virtue in some way. Bernard Mandeville, in his Fable of the Bees, was very influential in preaching that private vice was public virtue and, albeit Smith wanted to distance himself from Mandevillean irony, the invisible hand gave a certain substance to that rather paradoxical lesson. The centrepiece example of the invisible hand was the open and free market in which, so it was claimed, the individual pursuit of advantage—shameless self-seeking, as it appeared to many—would guarantee that goods were made available, to the beneWt of all, at competitive prices.
>
> ... Esteem and virtue go closely together. Thus in letting go of individual virtue as a source of collective order, economists and social scientists may have let go at the same time of the desire for being thought to be virtuous as a source of such order." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "We believe, as Adam Smith believed, that it is nature that endows people with an attraction for esteem, not just the corrupt culture of an old-style aristocracy. We believe that even if the invisible hand is a potent force of social order, still there is a lot of force attaching also to the intangible hand." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Among the things that may be expected to move people most reliably and forcibly is the desire to be thought well of by their fellows and the aversion to being regarded badly. People, so it was generally held, live under the regime or law of opinion and that regime moulds all that they are and do. It provides a gravitational field that silently shapes their dispositions and their doings, exerting a long, insistent influence that can only be resisted at the cost of considerable effort and self-sacrifice." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "In many cases... we will prefer someone to behave more virtuously, if with a greater desire for esteem, than to have them behave less virtuously but with a lesser concern to be admired." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Attitude-dependent goods of esteem may rationally be substituted by individuals for such material, action-dependent goods, as when someone foregoes a larger salary elsewhere in order to remain attached to a more estimable organisation—an organisation that may be expected to give them greater personal standing than the alternative—or when someone forgoes such esteem for a rise in salary." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Just as the economy of esteem is not insulated from the material economy or the regime of power, neither is it really a single, homogeneous system in itself. There will be many overlapping subsystems within the economy of esteem in almost any contemporary society. And almost every individual will belong to a number of those subsystems, having a stake in how he or she stands in each. The subsystems will compete with one another for the energy and time of participants. And they will often be in conflict, in the sense that a high performance in one will count against performing well in another. Teenagers at school will have a stake in how they are thought of by parents, teachers, and peers but will find, in all likelihood, that it is hard to do well simultaneously in each of those subcultures. Peers may deride them for a high standing in the other groups, for example, and may drive them into systematically underperforming on those fronts." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem incentives operate in a context where there are feedback eVects between individual action and the social context within which such action is pursued. The performance level of each individual contributes to the standards by which each performer is assessed. Accordingly, there are, as we might put it, unintended consequences in play in the economy of esteem. To appeal to the terminology of Schelling’s (1978) book, micro-motives create macro-behaviour patterns that are not simply a direct magnification of the individual case." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Esteem eVects still play an extensive role, both in explaining the allocation of persons across activities that might be sources of esteem, and in disciplining poor performance and encouraging high performance in those domains that do not admit the possibility of exit." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "When the number of persons in a given population who comply is relatively small, there will be positive esteem associated with so acting. Then, as the number of compliers increases, the amount of esteem attached to so acting will decline and conceivably disappear. For example, when few people tell the truth, doing so will be remarkable and represent a potentially significant source of esteem. But when most people are telling the truth, truth-telling is unremarkable and its esteem utility on that account unlikely to be very high. However, this fact does not necessarily imply that, over the range where most people conform, esteem eVects disappear. For, as it becomes a matter of course that people comply, it tends to become a source of disesteem to fail to do so. Accordingly, esteem-based incentives to comply with the norm are operative with varying levels of intensity more or less over the whole range. At the same time, the level of compliance that is forthcoming will be a positive function of the amount of esteem attached. The larger the esteem reward for complying, and/or the larger the disesteem penalty for not complying, the higher the level of compliance is likely to be." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Richard McAdams (1997) offers an example of a possible bootstrap phenomenon in relation to ideals of recycling. The story, as McAdams tells it, goes this way. Initially, recycling is a somewhat eccentric practice engaged in only by the environmental enthusiast extreme. Within that group, however, recycling gradually takes on the status of an appropriate ideal. And in the process, the practice accumulates an increasingly articulate normative defence. With that normative defence in place, those who recycle enjoy a certain level of esteem, at least from among the environmentally conscious. Recycling comes to signal a special environmental sensitivity that even those who don’t practise it are increasingly inclined to applaud. More and more people recycle in response to the esteem attached to the practice—and gradually the practice becomes normal. Once normal, however, it no longer reflects any particular credit on its practitioners, so positive esteem evaporates. At the same time, those who don’t recycle now begin to become conspicuous. Their conduct increasingly reveals an environmental insensitivity that is at Wrst mildly irritating and then begins to seem, as it becomes rarer, positively intransigent. Eventually, an apparently stable equilibrium is reached in which the only non-compliers are the especially shameless, the determined anti-environmentalists, and those who like to oVend. The practice of recycling has become established, bootstrapped up from an initial situation in which the practice was relatively rare." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Part of the reason for our interest in publicity is that it seems to us to be the chief means by which the forces of esteem can be channelled and directed. By increasing the exposure afforded to performances, one can increase the associated esteem incentives without incidentally inducing changes in the basic operation of the esteem economy. Publicity is, in that sense, the main lever available for policy intervention." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

> "Policy for increasing publicity—either by inhibiting secrecy (i.e. increasing the likelihood of observation) or by providing information/exposure on a subsidised basis—is one of the readiest means by which the economy of esteem can be supported by explicitly collective interventions. Equally, policies that support secrecy or require privacy or otherwise inhibit the extent of exposure are a primary means for undermining esteem-related incentives." - [The Economy of Esteem, An Essay on Civil and Political Society, by Geoffrey Brennan and Philip Pettit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1756178.The_Economy_of_Esteem)

forecasting - what if there was a disincentive to play on short term volatility and trends and there was incentive to be as close to the end result with your prediction as possible and for as long as possible? This would reduce momentum trading and technical analysis and focus on what really matters most - making liquidity matter less and bringing us closer to what traditional economic theory would suggest (equilibrium and efficiency).

Renaissance Technologies has not contributed tens of billions of value to the economy to be rewarded that much - they extracted that from market volatility by simply outsmarting everyone else. The most incredible of minds end up extracting and not contributing. Companies would have been fine without Ren Tech "helping" get their valuation closer to equilibrium by a few percentage points (actually they might have even helped valuations deviate further just by amplyfing trends) - very few companies end up selling shared on the market for financing their operations once public so their valuation being off by a few basis points won't matter at all to the economy - Ren Tech's actual contribution to the economy is close to 0. This is true of most (if not all) hedge funds.

> "In his 1982 book The Rise and Decline of Nations, Mancur Olson argued that societies are engulfed in a perpetual struggle between producers and rent-seekers. The former invent and start businesses, increasing the national income; the latter try to profit off of the producers’ hard work by lobbying for special privileges like monopolies and tax farms. In contrast to Douglass North, who emphasized the importance of secure property rights for economic growth, Olson distinguished between good and bad forms. Bad property rights entitled a specific group to subsidies or protections that imposed costs on consumers and inhibited growth—like, say, a local monopoly on woolen cloth weaving allowing a guild to suppress machinery in favor of labor-intensive hand labor, lowering productivity and output.
>
> Backed by its elite commercial and landed classes, the English and eventually British state came to favor the removal of the barriers to growth that had plagued most pre-modern economies. “Peace and easy taxes,” contra Smith, isn’t a sufficient condition for endogenous development, but its inverse—domestic chaos and rent-seeking—may be sufficient for its absence." - [Institutional Reforms Built the British Empire, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/10/31/institutional-reforms-built-the-british-empire/)



> "Economist Glen Weyl’s proposal for a tax based on a self-evaluated sales price for such monopolies, at which the owner is thereafter compelled to sell the monopoly right, seems particularly appropriate for these cases. This tax would deal with the holdout problem by requiring that registered property be self-assessed in value. Firms would then pay a percentage of that value as a tax. Market discipline forces them to honestly disclose their true valuation of ownership rights: the obligation to sell if offered their stated price prevents undervaluation, while the tax on the same value penalizes them for overvaluation.
>
> If firms faced the possibility of a mandatory sale of their intellectual property, they would likely be much more open to licensing it. This would open the possibility of greater competition while also spreading technological advances more rapidly. Both of these mechanisms allow for greater economic efficiency and less wasted effort in the creation of redundant technologies and in litigation over patents. But insofar as this ownership grants legitimate value, particularly in terms of gains from research and innovation, companies would be able to take advantage of it —and be properly priced for the privilege of doing so. By employing a legal framework based on understanding the value of property as a mechanism and the incentives of large firms, the state can both harness the power of intellectual property and pre-empt their stagnation. If another firm were able to use the intellectual property rights to a certain technology more profitably, they could gain control of it." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "Simply put, that amount of disposable cash makes firms difficult to regulate and prosecute, as they can retain legal resources far in excess of what the government can pit against them. And it’s not clear that their ability to buy start-ups is always economically efficient. While they may scale up new technologies at times, in many cases truly disruptive technologies or products are underdeveloped when they are owned by the exact firms they would disrupt. Reducing firms’ ability to accumulate such an enormous amount of liquidity may require a direct tax on the revenues of the largest firms in monopolistic or oligopolistic markets. Natural monopolies are effectively private rights to extract rents from the economy. Taxing these rents by some means shifts the tax burden off of more efficiently productive work, diminishes the incentives for cornering the market, and reduces the ability to accumulate too much cash. Of course this must be balanced with the value of private earned wealth for investment, and the financial incentive for innovation, which often creates new monopolies." - [How America Can Discipline Monopoly Power, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/04/20/how-america-can-discipline-monopoly-power/)

> "A competent regulatory structure must be able to referee the claims of consumers, employees, vendors, and the state, and ensure that the inevitable scale of these natural monopolies is not used to unfairly disadvantage other stakeholders.

> Our current FTC, Antitrust Division, Department of Commerce, and other government departments are of course inadequate to the task of applying this paradigm.

> "The gap between Facebook’s response at one end and California’s at the other showcases the difference between high-agency institutions and institutions ruled by drift and inertia. Facebook is not supposed to be a government—handwavy claims about its 2.6 billion digital citizens notwithstanding, Facebook is ultimately subordinate to the requests of national governments, and doesn’t exercise any form of sovereignty.
>
> It does, however, have part of the incentive structure of good government: since Facebook is so large, and its roster of advertisers is so lengthy, it’s exposed to broad negative and positive externalities. All else being equal, anything that makes U.S. small businesses grow a bit faster will make them spend more money on Facebook; anything that makes it harder for the average person to access the Internet—or that makes the average person less willing to bother—will hurt them. This doesn’t mean that Facebook’s incentives align perfectly with the greater good (they want to grow the pie, but they’re just as happy to take a bigger slice instead). But it does mean that they can act according to their indirect interests rather than direct ones.
>
> Financial markets ultimately help with this, because Facebook is valued highly relative to its sales. Every dollar of incremental sales for Facebook creates about $9 of market value, about $2.50 of which accrues to Mark Zuckerberg personally. And that value is based on Facebook’s long-term outlook; a high-multiple stock establishes a favorable exchange rate between the distant future and the immediate present, giving companies an incentive to make very long-term decisions even at the cost of short-term harms. Facebook, for example, noticed in 2018 that news stories led to vigorous discussion but fewer emotionally rewarding interactions, so they penalized those stories in their algorithm. This hurt their 2018 ad revenues, but benefited their 2030 active user counts, exactly the sort of tradeoff a controlling shareholder would prefer to make." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Idealists believe that every institution exists to build a better future for its participants. Cynics think every institution exists to perpetuate its own existence for the current benefit of whoever is in charge. The realist approach is to accept the cynical view as the ultimate asymptote to which all institutions trend, and to create incentives that align cynical self-preservation with prosocial behavior. Amazon employees who worked extra hours and took personal risk to keep delivering packages weren’t doing it to keep the economy afloat; they wanted bonuses, and they didn’t want to get fired. Facebook and Twitter didn’t send employees home out of pure altruism; they did it because operational disruptions are bad for business." - [Why Big Tech Is More Competent Than the US Government, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2020/07/01/why-big-tech-is-more-competent-than-the-us-government/)

> "Technology companies responded fast because they’re in the habit of acting. Other institutions responded slowly, because they’re in the habit of reacting, and a novel infectious disease did not have a default institutional reaction. Ultimately, there’s a teleological difference between these institutions. Tech companies have a defined purpose, and they’re a vehicle for achieving that purpose. Google wants to organize the world’s information, and turning a gigantic profit while doing so is one of their operating constraints. SpaceX wants to make humans a multi-planetary species, and submitting competitive bids for rocket launches is an early step to accomplish this. But the U.S. government doesn’t have a defined purpose, just a long list of functions, and those functions aren’t regularly interrogated. It’s uncomfortable for modern Americans to ask what the ultimate goal of the government is... But an institution without an ultimate purpose is functionally dead.

Still, it was high praise for a sector whose recklessness had thrown the world’s richest economy into chaos and who were rewarded for it with a bailout deal. And it raised a further question that had suddenly become relevant again because of the crisis: productive by what measure?
>
> When Mariana Mazzucato discusses that question, the Blankfein quote remains one of her favorite go-to’s. Based at University College London and founder of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, Mazzucato has spent her professional career on answering it. Her latest book on the topic is The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy, published in 2018.
>
> The book is a tour de force of economics, history, and policy. Such breadth is arguably necessary for Mazzucato’s fundamental goal: reopening the debate about economic value, what it includes, and who has the power to define it. What should count as real economic wealth? Who truly creates it, who merely assists the process, and who might be actively impeding it? The answers to that question have directed how economies develop, how governments direct or impede production, and what forms of economic power come to dominate human life.
>
> Once, the question of value dominated economic discourse. The French physiocrats argued that wealth was produced from the land. Conversely, Adam Smith tended to see landlords as a rentier class. Marx famously defined labor itself as the source of value. But this debate about value, once core to economic discourse, has long been de-emphasized in the discipline. As Mazzucato demonstrates, the marginal revolution in economics heralded a subjective, utility-focused approach that effectively sidestepped the historic debate about value—a sidestep that, in Mazzucato’s telling, drastically impoverished the discipline. An undergrad student today is likely to hear the above names once or twice in the opening lecture of an introductory course, and then only as a one-off primer. How did this happen?
>
> Following a historical primer on how the question of value was obscured, the book takes the reader through the successive results. Chief among these are the rise of financial power and its cannibalization of large parts of economic life, the extractive institutions in technological and medical innovation, and the gutting of a once-innovative and bold public sector, which had produced immense value across fields from consumer technology to medical products.
>
> Ultimately, Mazzucato exposes an orthodoxy of silence about value in modern economics, as well as in government. This orthodoxy, claims Mazzucato, has undermined public and private institutions and fundamentally weakened the ability of modern neoliberal economies to innovate." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "Smith also highlighted what he considered to be the great enemy of production: monopolistic power. Rentier landlords, mercantilist protectionism, and competition-stifling guilds were impediments to the market’s freedom. Unlike many who invoke him in the present, Smith saw government as playing a leading role in establishing what he defined as a ‘free market’: one free from rent-seeking monopoly power, not from government regulation." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

> "The notion that finance is part of the productive sphere at all is relatively new in the history of economic development. Aquinas and other medieval thinkers treated it with suspicion, Adam Smith more or less ignored it, and Marx treated it as part of capital’s “circulation phase.” Economists in the 20th century also critiqued it—Mazzucato notes Keynes and Minsky—but these warnings were not earth-shaking at a time when financial services were a very low share of national output. Interestingly, Mazzucato points out that Keynes prefigured modern concerns about finance’s brain drain of engineers and scientists with his quip that, rather than participating in a success story of laissez-faire capitalism, “the best brains of Wall Street have been in fact directed towards a different object.”
>
> ...
>
> Finance’s case is founded on the notion that it is a necessary part of spurring production by allocating capital. This is true, in a basic sense. Household savings don’t always cover costs, and business revenues don’t always cover investments. If finance merely pooled and directed resources to match these needs, it would not be a very exceptional industry. But in reality, finance does much more. Like other firms, banks are profit-driven. Rather than simple matchmaking, they act strategically to channel their revenues, especially into interest payments and toward shareholders. This logic fuels speculation bubbles, which are then continually refinanced through securitization and other strategies for inflating assets without investment." - [Mariana Mazzucato Has Reinvigorated the Most Important Battle in Economics, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2019/11/21/mariana-mazzucato-has-reinvigorated-the-most-important-battle-in-economics/)

Roland Coase
The nature of the firm
higher trust because of reputation & accountability => easier to "hire" others
also onboarding is easier if everything is out in the open - including the best materials to onboard someone and get him up to speed + building coherence with others


> "Coase published a paper titled “The Nature of the Firm.” Not long before, Coase had made a visit to the United States during which he toured Ford and General Motors. The industrial behemoths left him puzzled. How, he wondered, could economists say that Stalin was mistaken to run the Soviet Union like one gigantic company when Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., ran their own gigantic companies in similar ways? After all, the marketplace is theoretically the best mechanism for matching supply with demand, establishing prices, and extracting maximum utility from finite resources. So why don’t all individuals act as individual buyers and sellers, rather than gather in companies with tens of thousands of coworkers?
>
> Coase argued that there were good reasons for the seemingly contradictory structure of the vertically integrated corporation. One of the main reasons has to do with the cost of information. Producing a loaf of bread, assembling a car, or running a hospital emergency room involve steps where close cooperation and common purpose are essential to producing a useful product. In day-to-day practice it was not practical to break down manufacturing and other business processes into a series of separately negotiated transactions. Each transaction would incur costs that would outweigh whatever savings were achieved by competitive pressures.
>
> First, there would be search costs, such as finding different suppliers and determining if their goods were appropriate. Second, there would be contracting costs, such as negotiating the price and contract conditions. Third, there would be coordination costs of meshing the different products and processes. Coase called these “transaction costs.” And the upshot was that most corporations concluded it made the most sense to perform as many functions as possible in-house.
>
> All this leads to what we and our colleagues call “Coase’s law”: A firm will tend to expand until the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market. As long as it is cheaper to perform a transaction inside your firm, keep it there. But if it is cheaper to go to the marketplace, do not try to do it internally.
>
> How has the Internet affected Coase’s law? Strictly speaking, the law remains as valid as ever. But the Internet has caused transaction costs to plunge so steeply that it has become much more useful to read Coase’s law, in effect, backward: Nowadays firms should shrink until the cost of performing a transaction internally no longer exceeds the cost of performing it externally. Transaction costs still exist, but now they’re often more onerous in corporations than in the marketplace.
>
> Take another look at Coase’s three kinds of collaboration costs. Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan had to physically seek out promising suppliers, inspect their factories, and haggle over prices. In most cases, the costs of sourcing external suppliers were so high that ownership of production processes across the automotive value chain was warranted, even if individual links were thereby shielded from market disciplines. Ford Motor’s infamous River Rouge plant, which drew raw rubber and steel into one end and pushed finished cars out the other, was the quintessential example of this. Today’s automotive firms type “axle” or “window glass” into any number of industry exchanges, and negotiate the price on the Web. If they want, they can check a supplier’s trustworthiness—just scan through the treasure trove of analytic services available online.
>
> How about contracting and coordination costs? Need steel from China, rubber from Malaysia, or glass from Wichita, Kansas? No problem. Online clearinghouses for each of these products enable purchasers to contract for price, quality, and delivery dates with a few clicks of a mouse. An executive can even track each shipment on a virtual map that shows its precise location at any point in the journey." - [Wikinomics - How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154341.Wikinomics)

> "Every economic system needs three things to function. First, the system needs information—it needs some way to coordinate people’s actions, to convey to people what they need to do in light of what others are doing. Second, it needs incentives—it needs some way to induce people to act on the information they receive. Third, because people make mistakes, it needs learning—a process by which people become better at responding to information and incentives.
>
> ... In economic theory, the “Socialist Calculation Problem” or “Knowledge Problem” holds that in large-scale societies it is close to impossible to make good economic calculations without market prices or a good substitute for market prices. Market prices are not, as non-economists commonly believe, arbitrary numbers set by capricious managers. They are instead a function of supply and demand. Market prices thus convey information about the relative scarcity of goods in light of the effective demand for those goods. Market prices, therefore, tell producers and consumers how to adjust their behavior to other people’s wants and needs.
>
> So, for instance, if more industries start trying to buy aluminum, the sellers of aluminum will try to raise their prices. When The Coca-Cola Company notices that the price of aluminum is rising, it will try to find a way to use less aluminum. In fact, soda cans use much less aluminum now than they did 40 years ago, but the cans have a better design that allows them to be stacked high despite containing less metal. This is not because executives at The Coca-Cola Company are environmentalists, but because they knew they’d make more profit if they could cut costs.
>
> Or, suppose there’s a power outage. You rush to the store for ice to keep your beer cold. But when you get to the store, you find the now scarce ice is selling for $12 a bag. You’ll probably decide it’s not worth buying ice for your beer. What you don’t realize, though, is that by choosing not to buy the ice, you thereby leave it for the diabetic who needs it to cool his insulin. As economics textbooks say, market prices tend to ensure goods go to their highest value uses.
>
> Consider a simple object—a number 2 pencil. You might not realize it, but literally millions of people worked together to produce that pencil, although only a few hundred of them realized they were doing so. The person who mines the iron that will go into the ball bearings in machines that grind up the graphite and clay that will end up on the pencil might have little idea that he is helping to make pencils. Yet market prices bring these millions of people together to produce pencils.
>
> Few people, aside from academic economists, understand what market prices are, how prices convey information, and how such prices coordinate billions of people to work together. But the magic of prices is that they help us work together even though we don’t understand what prices mean.

> "We must be careful not to equate socialism with moral virtue or community spirit. Capitalism and socialism are simply ways of organizing the ownership of property. In capitalism, individuals may own the means of production. In socialism, they may not—the means of production are owned collectively (or by the representative of the collective, such as the State). Socialism is not love or kindness or generosity or oceans of delicious lemonade. Socialism is not equality or community. It’s just a way of distributing the control rights over objects. Cohen asserts that capitalism runs on greed and fear. Yet Cohen cannot simply assert this as a conceptual claim. Capitalism is not analytically tied to greed and fear. Whether a regime is capitalist or not has nothing to do with people’s motives... A social system is capitalist to the extent that it has private property in the means of production, decisions about the use of property are made by owners rather than by governments or society at large, people may make contracts as they please, legal monopolies and subsidies are absent, and so on. So, if Cohen had said, “By ‘capitalism’, I just mean a predatory system of greed and fear,” that would be no stronger a condemnation of market societies than if Adam Smith said, “By ‘socialism’, I just mean a system of bloodthirsty dictators who starve and slaughter peasants.” We cannot just decide to insert evil motivations into the very definition of capitalism in order to argue that capitalism is evil.
>
> ... If one really wanted to know what motivates people in market society, one would do genuine social-scientific research. One might ask: In the real world, does capitalism encourage predation, greed, fear, poverty, power-grabbing, and other nasty behaviors more so than other kinds of economic systems? What sort of behaviors and attitudes does socialism encourage? These questions cannot be settled by conceptual analysis, stipulation, or imagining people on camping trips. The only way to answer these questions is to go and check, to conduct historical, sociological, and psychological research on what exposure to markets does to people, and what happens when markets are replaced by something else. If capitalism turns out to encourage bad behaviors and bad attitudes, it is to that extent bad. Yet, if it also turns out to do so less, in the real world, than the alternatives (such as socialism) do in the real world, then to that extent we have reason to favor capitalism in the real world. In fact, there are people conducting just this sort of research. Neuroeconomist Paul Zak says:
>
> 'Market exchange itself may lead to a society where individuals have stronger character values. The clearest evidence for this is the studies of fairness in small-scale societies conducted by Henrich and his colleagues. They showed that the likelihood of making fair offers to a stranger in one’s society is more strongly predicted by the extent of trade in markets than any other factor they have found. Exchange is inherently other-regarding — both you and I must benefit if exchange is to occur.'
>
> Zak says that, as far as the evidence we have goes, market societies induce people to play fair. Economists like to conduct experiments (using large amounts of real money) in which participants have the opportunity to cheat and swindle one another or to play fairly. Joseph Henrich and other researchers have tested a large number of variables to see which factors tend to make people play fair or cheat. Herb Gintis further summarizes these studies:
>
> 'Movements for religious and lifestyle tolerance, gender equality, and democracy have flourished and triumphed in societies governed by market exchange, and nowhere else. My colleagues and I found dramatic evidence of this positive relationship between markets and morality in our study of fairness in simple societies — hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, nomadic herders, and small-scale sedentary farmers — in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Twelve professional anthropologists and economists visited these societies and played standard ultimatum, public goods, and trust games with the locals. As in advanced industrial societies, members of all of these societies exhibited a considerable degree of moral motivation and a willingness to sacrifice monetary gain to achieve fairness and reciprocity, even in anonymous one-shot situations. More interesting for our purposes, we measured the degree of market exposure and cooperation in production for each society, and we found that the ones that regularly engage in market exchange with larger surrounding groups have more pronounced fairness motivations. The notion that the market economy makes people greedy, selfish, and amoral is simply fallacious.'
>
> As it turns out, the strongest cultural predictor that participants will play fairly with strangers is how market-oriented their society is. People from market societies characteristically know how to put themselves in their trading partner’s shoes. People from non-market societies do not. Other studies produce similar results. Zak and Stephen Knack have shown that market societies also tend to be high-trust societies, while non-market societies tend to be low-trust societies. Omar Al-Ubaydli and colleagues have shown that “priming” people with words related to markets and trade makes them more (not less!) trusting, trustworthy, and fair in experiments. Institutionalist economics often argues that market exchange does not rely upon self-interest alone. It also relies upon—and at the same time tends to reinforce—mutual trust, reciprocity, and trustworthiness. Market systems require a high degree of generalized trust and trustworthiness in order to function. Consider the fact that I could fly to Hong Kong, a city I have never visited, flash a credit card, and be supplied a luxury car, all on my promise to pay. Somehow, market societies make this promise mean something. To illustrate this further, every year the Fraser Institute, a free-market think tank located in Canada, ranks countries by how free market their economies are. Their top 10 in 2012 are Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Bahrain, Mauritius, Finland, and Chile. Denmark is ranked #16. The United States is ranked #18. Transparency International, ranked a non-government organization (NGO) focused on fighting political corruption, publishes a “Corruption Perceptions Index,” which ranks how corrupt countries are perceived to be. According to Transparency International, these are the top 10 least corrupt countries: Denmark, New Zealand, Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Switzerland, and Norway. You may notice quite a bit of overlap between the most economically free and the least corrupt countries. That’s not a coincidence. As Figure 3.1 shows, there is a positive correlation between countries’ degree of economic freedom (as measured by the Fraser Institute’s economic freedom ratings) and countries’ perceived lack of corruption (as measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index). This kind of empirical work is not the final word. It does not decisively prove that market societies foster better motivations than socialist societies. However, it is better than hypothesizing from the armchair, as philosophers are apt to do. The only way to know whether capitalism is corrupting or ennobling is to do bona fide social-scientific research." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "PROPERTY RIGHTS: A BRIEF DESCRIPTION
>
> The distinctive features of capitalism are (1) extensive private property, especially in productive capital goods or the “means of production,” (2) voluntary trading of private property on the market, and (3) that every person possesses an extensive sphere of economic liberty in which she may make decisions as she pleases. Before moving on to explain why 1–3 would be valuable even in utopian conditions, I need to explain briefly just what private property is. When we say that Minnie Mouse owns the Bowtique, or that she has private property rights in her Bowtique, we mean that:
>
> 1. Minnie may use the Bowtique at will. That is, under normal circumstances, she can feel free to use it when she pleases and how she pleases, provided she respects the rights of others.
>
> 2. Minnie may alter or even destroy the Bowtique.
>
> 3. Minnie may sell, give away, rent, or otherwise transfer the Bowtique to others.
>
> 4. She may use the Bowtique to earn income.
>
> 5. Minnie may exclude others from using, changing, destroying, or interacting with the Bowtique. Others may not use the Bowtique without Minnie’s permission.
>
> 6. If others harm or destroy Minnie’s Bowtique, they owe her compensation.
>
> 7. Other people have a moral obligation to respect points 1–6; they are morally obligated not to interfere with Minnie as she uses, modifies, transfers, excludes, or destroys the Bowtique.
>
> So, a private property right is not really one unified right, but a bundle of related rights. Together, these rights give the owner a wide degree of control and discretion over an object, and, at the same time, exclude other people from exerting control over that object. Note that when we say that Minnie may use the Bowtique at will, we don’t mean that she may do just anything she wants with it. Our rights are always limited by other people’s rights. Consider: I have a right to free speech, but that right doesn’t imply that I am free to show up in your bedroom at 2 a.m. to recite the lyrics of “Raining Blood.” Similarly, Minnie has the right to use her bow-making equipment as she sees fit within a wide range of possible uses, but that doesn’t mean she can use it to murder other people. I have a right to own a guitar, but not the right to smash you in the face with it. Exactly how all of our rights fit together is a complicated philosophical question. I won’t expand on the point here, since there’s no special problem here for property rights as opposed to rights in general, and since the question of how rights fit together is reasonably well understood. Note also that property rights need not be considered absolute. They might instead be what philosophers call prima facie rights. The difference between an absolute right and a prima facie right concerns whether other moral considerations can ever trump or override these rights. Absolute rights right can never be trumped or overridden. But prima facie rights can be. So, for instance, my property right with respect to my lawn forbids you from running on my lawn without my permission. You may not choose to run around on my lawn just because you would enjoy doing so. However, suppose you were being chased by ravenous zombies and needed to cross my lawn to get away. If my property rights were absolute, it would be wrong for you to run across my lawn as you flee. However, if property rights are prima facie rights rather than absolute rights, then you may run across my lawn to get away. For reasons like this, philosophers tend to think property rights are prime facie rather than absolute. Note also that while ownership is a bundle of rights, we can own different things in different ways. Sometimes we own things, but this ownership doesn’t include all the particular rights listed above. For instance, Mickey owns a real dog, Pluto, while Donald owns a stuffed toy lion, Sparky. The way Mickey owns Pluto is different from how Donald owns Sparky. Donald may destroy Sparky at will, or slice Sparky up, or give Sparky to a person he knows will abuse him. But Mickey cannot do any of those things with Pluto, even though he owns Pluto. And so it goes with other things. Sometimes we own houses that come with restricted covenants, or pool club memberships we can sell only in confined ways. How we own things varies from thing to thing." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "PRIVATE PROPERTY IN UTOPIA
>
> ... The philosopher Loren Lomasky points out that people ... are project-pursuers. They have ideas and visions that they want to implement. Pursuing projects over the long term is often part (if not the only part) of what gives coherence and meaning to our lives. To express ourselves, develop ourselves, craft ourselves, and so on, often requires that we have sustained and exclusive control of objects over time. And so most people have an interest in controlling certain objects over time.
>
> If Minnie owns a bow factory, this means she may use it at will as she sees fit, but other people may not use it (modify it, destroy it, move it, etc.) without her permission. Minnie has a particular vision or set of goals she wants to achieve. She has projects she wants to engage in. To do so, she needs stuff, and she needs to be able to count on using that stuff in a sustained way over time. If the materials of her Bowtique were up for grabs—if just anyone could use them, even on a set schedule—she would not be able to pursue her vision of the good life. She needs the Bowtique to be at her disposal. The Bowtique is her creation, her vision, her project. Even though Minnie is happy to work with others on many other projects, it means something to her to control the Bowtique alone. She can count on being able to run her Bowtique as she pleases. Minnie takes a certain pride in having a bow factory that is hers, not because she’s fetishistic about consumption or control, but because this gives her an avenue to exercise her talents and achieve excellence in a long-standing project. Similar remarks apply to the other characters. Willie the Giant wants to farm. In an imaginary ideal socialist economy, the nice socialists would no doubt let Willie plow the collectively owned fields with the collectively owned plow. But that’s not good enough. Willie wants a farm that he can shape according to his vision. He wants the farm to be his, not because he’s selfish and mean, but because he wants to realize his own personal plans and ideas of how farming should go. For that to happen, he needs to have property that he can use at will and that others will refrain from using. It’s not just that Minnie, Donald, and Willie want exclusive use-rights over objects. They also want to be able to use, give-away, sell, and, in some cases, destroy these objects, as part of their pursuit of their visions of the good life. It means something for Minnie to be able to sell bows to others—that others are willing to buy from her because they like the bows rather than as a favor to her. It means something to Clarabelle that she can choose to sell her muffins or instead give them for free to a sick friend. And so on.

> Some philosophers—themselves having never owned a business—might have a hard time understanding these kinds of desires. But if that philosopher can understand why one might want to write a book by oneself, rather than with co-authors or by committee, the philosopher can similarly understand why someone might want to own a factory or a farm or a store. Or, if an artist can understand why one might want to paint by oneself, rather than having each brushstroke decided by committee, or rather than having to produce each painting collectively, then the artist can similarly understand why someone might want to own a factory or a farm or a store.
>
> Another closely related reason for having private property, even in utopia, has to do with the sheer aggravation of always having to ask permission. Imagine everything belonged to everybody. Now imagine everyone loves each other very much. Still, every time you go to use something, you’d have to check and see if anyone else needed or wanted to use it. (“Hey, does anyone need the laptop right now?”) Or, otherwise, we’d have to develop conventions such that you knew, without asking permission, that you could use particular things at certain times. (“Oh, good, it’s 6 p.m., now it’s my turn to use one of the village laptops.”) There’s something deeply annoying about both of those scenarios, even if we love others as much as we love ourselves. We want to have a range of objects that we can count on to be free to use at will, without first having to ask permission or to check with others or to follow a schedule. Without the right to make use of a range of objects at will, we will feel stifled and repressed.
>
> People have a need to feel “at home” in the world. Most of us feel “at home” in our homes because we may unilaterally shape our homes to reflect our preferences. Our homes are governed by the principles we endorse. We do not have to deliberate in public and justify our furniture arrangements to others in society. To the extent that we have private property, we acquire the means to carve out a space for ourselves in which we can be at home. That’s not to say that we cannot also feel at home in a collective. Mickey and Minnie enjoy communal activities and property just as much as they enjoy private activities and property. The important point is that most of us need both—we need at times to participate in a larger community, and we need at times to escape to our private ventures and spaces. Without private property, we cannot do the latter.
>
> Note further that, in pursuing our projects, it’s not just that sometimes I need access to an electric guitar or that Michelangelo needed access to paint. Rather, there’s an additional value to be gained from having access to the same electric guitar and the same paintbrushes over time. Over time, we incorporate objects in the world into our lives—they form part of our histories... We form relationships with some objects, with some of the things we own, with the books we write, with the artwork our children make us, and so on. This is not just a toy cheetah, but the very toy cheetah we joked like to eat monsters at night and so would keep my son safe from harm as he slept. This is not just a hammer, but the hammer my uncle used when he built his own house after the war. This is not just a Mustang, but the Mustang Steve McQueen drove in Bullitt (1968; dir. Pete James). And so on. And this is yet another reason why the Clubhouse Villagers have private property, even though they are so generous and kind that they could make do without it. They form relationships with particular objects and incorporate those objects into their lives.
>
> ... There is another reason for private property, when we try to practice utopia on a grand scale: The limits of our knowledge. We have imperfect information. Sure, in a small village, we might all know that the nice thing to do is let Minnie use the bow-making equipment whenever she wants. And so maybe there’d be little harm in saying that the equipment belongs to all, but we’ll just all choose to let Minnie possess it “as if” she had property rights in it. But in a large society, there’s just no way to scale this kind of thing up. I don’t know enough about other people, what their needs and desires are, or how different objects fit into their plans or projects. Related to this point, in previous work, Schmidtz and I have argued that private property is useful to help us form expectations:
>
> 'Consider, then, the point of property rights. In a way, such rights are like fences: their whole point is to get in the way. Or, if putting up fences does not sound liberating, consider a different metaphor: rights are like traffic lights. Traffic lights facilitate movement not so much by turning green as by turning red. Without traffic lights, we would all have, in effect, a green light, and the result would be gridlock. By contrast, a system where we face, in turn, red and green lights helps to keep us moving. The system constrains us, but we all gain in terms of our ability to get where we want to go; for we develop mutual expectations that enable us to do so uneventfully. Red lights can be frustrating, but the game they create for us is a positive-sum one. We all reach our destination more quickly, more safely, and more predictably, because we know what to expect from each other.'
>
> This is another instrumental defense of private property. But notice that this defense does not essentially rely upon the idea that private property is necessary to rescue us from problems arising from our moral failings. Here again the issue is cognitive, not moral. Adding to this, and staying with the traffic metaphor, consider the rules we use for four-way stops:
>
> 1. Whoever arrives first, gets to go first.
>
> 2. In the case of simultaneous arrival, whoever is on the right goes first.
>
> 3. If literally all four people arrive at the same time, resolve the conflict by waving.
>
> We also have a rule for emergencies:
>
> 4. Let the person with a known emergency go first!
>
> The fourth rule distributes the right of way according to need, while the other three do not. If the fourth rule—the need-based rule—trumps the others, why not just replace rules 1–4 with a new rule, 5?:
>
> 5. At any four-way stop, whoever has the most need gets to go first.
>
> In fact, there’s an obvious reason why not. Imagine what it would be like to live like that. We’d have to stop, get out of our cars, and have a conversation each time we come to a four-way stop. Even if we were all perfectly honest and good, this kind of rule would just be too costly. Distributing according to need is not what we need. This is not because we are morally flawed, but because we have cognitive limitations.
>
> Some socialists (although not, I think, Cohen) would object here that they have no problem with people owning personal, non-productive property, like toothbrushes or guitars they use in hobbies. They only have a problem with people owning productive property, like farm equipment or bow factories. But there are two big problems with this.
>
> First, it’s not clear there’s a deep distinction between productive and non-productive property. John Petrucci’s signature Music Man JP6 guitar is productive property he uses to earn a living; my Music Man JP6 guitar is non-productive property I use for fun. Eddie Van Halen uses his EVH 5150 III amplifier to earn a living; I use one for fun. Does this mean, from a socialist perspective, that it’s bad to let Petrucci have his guitars or Van Halen to own his amps, but fine for me to have them? Similarly, is it wrong for Hertz to rent cars to make money, but okay for you to own those exact same cars to drive yourself to work or your kids to soccer practice? Is it okay for Scrooge McDuck (in his DuckTales incarnation) to have his massive pile of money, so long as he uses it just for swimming and not as capital for investing? Is it okay for my aunt Jackie to own a loom as a decoration, but does it become wrong if she then starts making and selling fabric with it? For the most part, it seems like the difference between productive and nonproductive property is just how we use it. So, at most, socialists don’t really oppose allowing people to own private “productive property”; they oppose allowing people to use their private property in a productive way.
>
> Second, it’s not clear why, in ideal conditions, socialists would have any problem with people owning productive property. Socialists—such as many of the Occupy Wall Street protestors—object that allowing private ownership in the means of production leads to all sorts of problems—such as exploitation, treating people as instruments, objectionable inequality, a lack of opportunity, or whatnot—but these problems occur only under real-world conditions, not in utopian conditions. In the utopian conditions of Clubhouse capitalism, capitalist factory owner Minnie Mouse would never exploit anyone, because she is too nice. Capitalist Minnie Mouse would never allow objectionable inequalities or a lack of opportunity, because she and others like her would just choose to give the deserving poor what they need. And so on. Socialists’ moral objections to private property apply only in non-ideal, non-utopian conditions. They are irrelevant in this debate. In our world, we might all agree that Occupy Wall Street has some legitimate complaints, even if we do not all agree on their proposed solutions. But there is no Occupy (Main Street, U.S.A.?) movement in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse world, because none of the occupiers’ complaints apply to ideal capitalism.
>
> So, to summarize, there is a range of reasons to have private property, even in utopian conditions. People get value from having objects that they can use at will, without having to ask permission from others. They get value from being able to pursue projects, and to do so, they sometimes need objects over which they gain exclusive control. People have grounds for wanting to be able to pursue projects alone, rather than doing everything collectively. They find value in having spaces that are all their own, so that they can feel “at home” in those spaces. People can form sentimental attachments to particular objects that have a special history. And, finally, the most effective way of making sure people have the objects they need for their projects is often to follow the rules of private property, rather than treating everything as if it were a common pool to be distributed according to need. Sure, in utopia, we could make do without private property, but private property makes utopia better." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "MARKETS AND ECONOMIC LIBERTY IN UTOPIA
>
> We’ve established why, even under utopian conditions, people would get additional value from having private property. Now let’s discuss further why they would get value not just in having private property, but also in buying, selling, and trading this property in markets, and in having a wide sphere of economic liberty. A capitalist society endows each person with a wide sphere of economic freedom. Why would people in utopian conditions value having such a wide sphere? I’ll discuss two sets of reasons, one having to do with how markets help achieve prosperity, and one having to do with the goal of having people be the authors of their own lives.
>
> First, markets are important to ensure that people can be as prosperous as possible. Even in utopian conditions, market-societies will outperform socialist societies in economic terms. Some socialists might balk here that we should not be so focused on filthy lucre. But Cohen, I think, would disagree. Marxists say that real liberty is not just the absense of interference from others, but also the effective power, capacity, or ability to do what one wills. Call this conception of liberty positive liberty. For example, a bird has the positive liberty to fly, but human beings do not. Cohen once argued that “to have money is to have freedom.” He says that money, or more precisely, the real wealth that money represents, is like a ticket that gives people access to the world. The more wealth one has, the more one is able to do, and in that sense, the more freedom one has. If we care about people having positive liberty, then we care about making them as wealthy as we can. As the former paramount leader of communist China Deng Xiaoping is thought to have said, “To get rich is glorious!” I agree. In my ideal world, everyone who wants to be is a googolplexinaire.
>
> Now, keep in mind that trade is usually—and especially in utopian conditions—a positive-sum game. That is, when people are free to make trades and free to walk away from any trades they don’t want to make, then such trades will usually benefit both parties. In a market exchange—even in real-world capitalism—both parties to the trade make a profit. The difference between utopian and real-world capitalistic trading has to do with motivations. In the real world, we are fairly selfish, and so are less concerned with how well our trading partners do. In utopian capitalism, we are more strongly motivated to make sure the other party to the trade does well.
>
> In a class I teach on political economy, I illustrate the concept of gains from trade by doing an in-class experiment. As students enter, I give each of them a different candy bar. I ask them to rate the candy they received on a scale of 1–10, with 1 meaning they hate the candy and 10 meaning they love the candy. I then add up their scores. (For instance, in a fall 2013 seminar with 19 students, the total was 103.) After, I tell them they are free to make trades with any willing partner they wish. Most students make a trade, and everyone who trades is happier with her new candy than she was with the old. After all trading is ceased, I ask them to rate the candy they now have. Usually, the total value of the candy goes up 30–50%. (For instance, in the fall 2013 seminar, the final total was 149.) I then ask students, is there some way we could have made it possible to have even higher gains from trade? Usually, they conclude that if we had even more students trading a greater variety of candy bars (or even things other than candy bars), the gains would have been even higher. And so, in 10 minutes, the students discover first hand what Adam Smith explained in the first few pages of the Wealth of Nations (1981): the greater the size of the market, the greater the potential prosperity we can all enjoy.
>
> Economists have long understood that in a market economy, the systematic effect of private citizens’ pursuit of private ends is to create background conditions of wealth, opportunity, and cultural progress. Each of us does as well as we do because of the positive externalities created by an extended system of social cooperation. This extended system of cooperation explains why each of us in contemporary liberal societies have our high standards of living and easy access to culture, education, and social opportunities. We are engaged in networks of mutual benefit, and we benefit from other people being engaged in these networks. When we go to work in business, we help create, sustain, and improve these networks of mutual benefit. When things are going well—and overall they tend to go well—we create a series of positive externalities through our innovations, through the division of labor, and by helping to create economies of scale.
>
> This is all true of real-world markets. Would it be less true of markets in utopia, if utopia even has such markets? Keep in mind that in utopia, by definition, people are too nice to cause certain problems that occur in real-world markets. In utopian capitalism, you don’t have to worry about deception or “information asymmetries”—the mechanic never charges you for unnecessary work, and the used car salesperson always tells you the whole truth about the car. In utopian capitalism, you wouldn’t have to worry about exploitation—the buyer wouldn’t dare take advantage of your bad luck in order to offer you a low price. In utopia, no one tries to corner the market through monopolies or monopsonies. In utopia, everyone gladly contributes his or her fair share to public goods, knowing full well that everyone else will, too.
>
> Recall from Chapter One that all economic systems need information, incentives, and learning. By “information,” I mean that people need some signal that tells them how to coordinate their actions with others. By “incentives,” I mean that people need something that induces them to act on that information. And by “learning,” I mean that, since in the real world people respond imperfectly to information and incentives, we need something that trains people to respond better. In real-world conditions, socialism faces an incentive problem.
>
> In utopian conditions, socialism’s incentive problem disappears. However, the information problem remains. Thus, under utopian conditions, if people want to benefit from having a large-scale division of labor and being able to cooperate and work together with hundreds of thousands, millions, or billions of others, they will need to use markets.
>
> In real-world capitalism, we often make trades with people for whom we have only minor, diffuse concern. In utopia, however, everyone is motivated by a strong desire to promote the common good and the good of all. But this is a reason to use markets, not a reason to avoid them. In an ideal society, everyone is supposed to be motivated to promote the good of all, not just her own good. But, if so, then most people will be strongly motivated to participate in markets. If they want to coordinate their mutual activities to promote everyone’s good as best they can, the most effective way is through trade on the market. Market prices convey information about the relative scarcity of goods in light of the effective demand for those goods. Market prices thus tell producers and consumers how to adjust their behavior to scarcity and demand. When it comes to making maximal use of the information needed to run a large economy, nothing beats the market.
>
> To illustrate this, imagine that Mickey Mouse could have a magic wand that would make everyone 30 times’ richer over a period of 200 years. Mickey, being benevolent, would, of course, wave the wand.
>
> Now, suppose instead that Mickey Mouse could come up with an ideal economic plan, as old-fashioned socialists wanted. Imagine that Mickey Mouse is some kind of noble philosopher-king (or philosopher central-planner). He determines a way for us to work together, to divide up tasks, to cooperate, and so on, such that if we follow his plan, then over the next 200 years, we will all become 30 times’ richer. In utopian conditions, people would want to go along with Mickey’s plan voluntarily, because they would see that by going along with the plan, they promote the good of all. In utopian conditions, people would want to come together under Mickey’s guidance to produce such wonderful outcomes. (I’m sure Mickey would as best he can make provisions for ensuring that people get jobs and tasks that they enjoy, so that they all have good lives as they go along with his plan.) When everyone follows Mickey’s advice, it is kind of like waving the magic wand.
>
> The problem, of course, is that we don’t have any such magic wand, and Mickey Mouse just isn’t smart enough to come up with a functionally equivalent economic plan. Mickey is God-like in his moral character, but not in his brainpower. But the good news is that mainstream economics tells us that the market economy is, fundamentally, the same as the philosopher-king Mickey or the magic wand.12 While Mickey would have offered suggestions as part of his plan, the market instead offers prices, profits, and losses. And so, just as publicly spirited, benevolent people would want to go along with philosopher-king Mickey’s plan, they would want to participate in the market and respond to the signals the market sends. To follow the price signals of the market just would be to serve the common good of each and all.
>
> That’s not to say that everything in capitalist utopia will be done via for-profit business. Capitalist utopia would probably have a robust civil society, full of not-for-profit institutions and communal spaces, just as we see in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village. But it can benefit from having for-profit businesses, too. In fact, for large utopias of thousands of people or more, markets become imperative. Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck can practice pure socialism on a small scale. Although they are nice enough to make it work on a large scale, they aren’t smart enough to make it work on a large scale.
>
> So, one reason to have markets in utopia is to ensure that people are prosperous and enjoy extensive positive liberty. But there is another reason as well. John Tomasi argues that people have an interest in being “self-authors,” that is, in choosing a conception of the good life and finding the means to achieve that conception. For most people, if not all, this means they need a wide sphere of liberty in which to make decisions in the economic realm. As Tomasi says, people are defined by the choices they make, by what they choose to do, and on what terms they choose to do it. Consider the following questions: Where should I work, and on what terms? How much should I consume, and how much should I save? How should I save? What should I consume? How will I decide among different possible goods and services? Is it more important to have a sports car or to take a family vacation? Should we add an addition to our house or send the children to camp for the summer? And so on. In a capitalist society, everyone is an economic planner. Everyone faces a constant stream of economic choices. How people respond to these choices both reflects and helps to determine just who they are as individuals. According to Tomasi:
>
> 'These are not mere details within a person’s life. The particular pattern of decisions one makes in response to these questions about working often goes a long way to defining what makes one person’s life distinct from the lives of other people. A society that denied individuals the right to make decisions regarding those aspects of their working experience would truncate the ability of those people to be responsible authors of their own lives. Indeed, denied these fuller freedoms …, citizens would no longer be authors of their own lives. Decisions about matters that affect them intimately would have been taken out of their hands and decided for them by others.'
>
> Many on the Left have a difficult time understanding why economic decisions could have such importance when it comes to people being responsible authors of their own lives. But, Tomasi says, these same people understand easily how our decisions about social, civil, and personal matters—about whom we will love, what god we will worship and how, whom we will associate with and on what terms, what hobbies we will pursue and to what degree, what books we will read and when, what music we will listen to and how loudly, what we will choose to learn and what we will ignore, and so on—shape who we are. Most people on the Left agree that if we want to allow people to be authors of their own lives, we need to grant them a wide sphere of liberty on these matters. Tomasi just says that if one can understand why it might be important to decide for oneself what and how much to read, one can similarly understand why it might be important to decide for oneself what and how much to save, invest, consume, and so on.
>
> Now, many on the Left want to reduce the sphere of economic liberty in the real world because they believe that granting people such an extensive sphere will lead to bad results. They worry that capitalists will exploit workers, that the rich will subvert democracy, that the poor will fall behind, or that the poor are too unconscientious to make rational decisions about how to spend and save. They are right, to some extent. But none of these worries apply to utopian capitalism. If we are playing by Cohen’s rules, if we are talking about what a just society would look like, then we are talking about a world where people are too good and just to do anything of these bad things." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

> "NOT JUST UTOPIA, BUT A FRAMEWORK FOR UTOPIAS
>
> So, which would you choose? Actually, that’s a trick question. The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village wouldn’t make you choose. And that’s one of the reasons why it’s morally superior. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village has a voluntaryist, anarchist, capitalist, libertarian structure. While it has some collective property, it is not a commune as a whole. Yet the Clubhouse Village would allow a commune within its borders. If, say, the Smurfs wanted to form a commune within the greater village, the other villagers would have no problem with that. Capitalism is tolerant. Want to have a worker-controlled firm? Go for it. Want to start a kibbutz or commune in which everything is collectively owned? No problem. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Villagers would allow Cohen to have his permanent socialist camping trip, so long as Cohen likewise lets Minnie Mouse have her Bowtique. There is an essential asymmetry in the capitalist and the socialist visions of utopia. Capitalists allow socialism, but socialists forbid capitalism. Capitalism permits people to own property individually, but it also permits them to own it collectively. In contrast, socialism forbids people from owning property individually, and only allows them to own it collectively. A capitalist utopia would allow people to form communes, but a socialist utopia would forbid Minnie from owning a factory by herself. Cohen thinks it’s best if everyone lives the socialist camping trip lifestyle. He would recruit everyone into the camping trip. He would, if he could, wave a magic wand that would make us all committed to communal life. He has one vision for utopia. It’s a fine vision, really, but there are other fine visions as well. The capitalist vision of utopia is bigger and broader than Cohen’s. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village is a libertarian, laissez-faire, market-society utopia, but allows non-libertarian, socialist utopias within its borders, so long as the inhabitants of these socialist utopias are there by choice rather than force. Capitalist utopia can contain socialist utopias within it. As Nozick argues in his book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, capitalist utopia is not really one utopia, but many. It provides a “framework” in which many different utopias could co-exist in peace and mutual respect. This is crucial, because 'people are different. They differ in temperament, interests, intellectual ability, spiritual quests, and the kind of life they wish to lead. They diverge in values and they have different weightings for the values they share…. There is no reason to think that there is one community which will serve as an ideal for all people and much reason think that there is not.' ... Nozick notes that utopian writers have, with few exceptions, been so convinced of the beauty of their vision, that they have described utopia as being just one kind of community. But, Nozick says, it’s more plausible that utopia is not all one thing. Instead, utopia is a collection of utopias: many different kinds of communities with many different kinds of people. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village could be not just a utopia, but a meta-utopia in which you may choose the utopia that’s best for you. The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Village is utopia not simply because it offers a beautiful vision of its own, but also because it allows other utopias to flourish within its borders. It leaves everyone free to create or inhabit the utopia of her choice with others who also choose to live there. It offers a framework in which inhabitants of one utopia can take joy in co-existing and contemplating the lifestyles of the inhabitants of other utopias.17 The capitalist Mickey Mouse Clubhouse gives you everything Cohen’s socialist camping trip gives you, and then gives you even more. If Cohen has given us a portrait of utopia, Nozick has given us an art gallery. If Cohen’s socialist utopia is the Mona Lisa, Nozick’s capitalist utopia is the entire contents of the Louvre. The slogan of capitalist utopia might be something like, “Let a hundred flowers blossom.”
>
> CONCLUSION
>
> Cohen says our theories of justice should be about what’s best, period, not about what’s best given how selfish and nasty people are. Justice is the thing that happens in a world where people have morally perfect motivations and always do whatever morality requires of them. In that kind of world, the problems of real-life socialism disappear. And so, Cohen claims, socialism becomes a desirable way to live. He’s right. But in that kind of world, the problems of real-life capitalism disappear as well, while many of its virtues remain. And that makes all the difference. Socialists are forever offering us an inferior product. Ideal capitalism is better than ideal socialism, and realistic capitalism (of some sort) is better than realistic socialism. The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse shows us, to our great surprise, that when we judge systems by Marxist philosophical standards, capitalism becomes the most intrinsically desirable way to live. And, surprisingly, one reason Clubhouse Capitalism becomes the most desirable way to live is that for some small percentage of us, socialism is the most desirable way to live. In the real world, capitalism encourages entrepreneurs to provide you with the things you want at prices you can afford to pay. In the ideal world, capitalism does even better: it gives you the opportunity to live in your personal utopia." - [Why not capitalism? by Jason Brennan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18762452-why-not-capitalism)

Evolution can perform its tricks not just in the “substrate” of DNA, but in any system that has the right information-processing and information-storage characteristics. In short, evolution’s simple recipe of “differentiate, select, and amplify” is a type of computer program—a program for creating novelty, knowledge, and growth. Because evolution is a form of information processing, it can do its order-creating work in realms ranging from computer software to the mind, to human culture, and to the economy... Our intentionality, rationality, and creativity do matter as a driving force in the economy, but they matter as part of a larger evolutionary process.

> "... the hallmark of a science is not its ability to forecast the future, but its ability to explain things—to increase our understanding of the workings of the universe. As mentioned before, the role of prediction in science is to help us distinguish between competing explanations. A well-formulated theory will have logical implications that can be tested... Science is a continuous learning process in which the logical implications of competing explanations are tested and a body of evidence is accumulated over time. As Sir Karl Popper showed in the 1930s, there is no “final proof” that a theory is correct, but one can say whether a theory is disproved by data, whether one theory fits the data better than another, and whether a theory has yet to be contradicted by data. For example, one cannot say that Einstein’s theory of relativity has been proven, but one can say that its predictions have been well tested, it has yet to be contradicted, and it fits the data better than any alternative explanation proposed thus far. Science thus goes through a process of proposing various explanations, rigorously articulating them in ways that can be tested, eliminating theories that fail the tests, and building on the ones that succeed." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "Kauffman argues that an effective way to increase adaptability and avoid conflicting constraints is to break things up. Organizing the network into hierarchies reduces the density of connections and thus reduces the interdependencies in the network. Hierarchies are critical in enabling networks to reach larger sizes before diseconomies of scale set in. This is why so many networks in the natural and computer worlds are structured as networks within networks. In an organizational context, the conventional wisdom is that hierarchy is a feature of bureaucracy that reduces adaptability. Managers are told that they should de-layer and flatten their organizations. But counterintuitively, hierarchy can serve to increase adaptability by reducing interdependencies and enabling an organization to reach a larger size before gridlock sets in... Hierarchy does, of course, have its problems; for example, information can degrade as it travels up the chain, the top may become out of touch with the front line, and a poor performer in a senior role can do a lot of damage. But just assuming that hierarchy is inherently bad is simplistic and misses its crucial role as an interdependency breaker." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "... evolution is not just about biology. Rather, evolution is a general-purpose and highly powerful recipe for finding innovative solutions to complex problems. It is a learning algorithm that adapts to changing environments and accumulates knowledge over time. It is the formula responsible for all the order, complexity, and diversity of the natural world. And ... it is the same formula that lies behind all the order, complexity, diversity, and, ultimately, wealth in the economic world.

> ... The setup for evolution thus boils down to information processing. In order for evolution to get a foothold, the algorithm needs an information-processing medium: something to store, modify, and copy schemata... Once the information-processing medium is established, the processes of differentiation, selection, and replication can begin. Good replicators replicate, and what is fit is defined by the environment, which includes competition with other replicators. Evolution then starts its march through design space, seeking out designs that are better and better replicators." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "The impact of science has essentially been to dramatically increase the hit rate of deductive insights. Deduction thus suddenly began to play a much bigger role in the deductive-tinkering mix. Deductive scientific theories did not completely replace tinkering; any engineer will tell you that what works in theory does not always work in practice. But the balance was tipped toward a very potent combination of the two, thereby dramatically increasing the speed with which evolution could find high peaks in the PT landscape. Technology evolution is not a mere metaphor. It is the result of humankind’s deductive-tinkering search through the near-infinite possibilities of Physical Technology space. The nature of the process of differentiation, selection, and replication in this substrate is different from that of biology, but it is an evolutionary process nonetheless. This means that PT evolution follows the same general laws that apply to other evolutionary systems." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "The rule of law, the existence of property rights, a well-organized banking system, economic transparency, a lack of corruption, and other social and institutional factors played a far greater role in determining national economic success than did any other category of factors. Even countries with few resources and incompetent governments did reasonably well if they had strong, well-developed Social Technologies. On the flip side, no countries with poor Social Technologies performed well, no matter how well endowed they were with resources or how disciplined their macroeconomic policies were. Not only do Social Technologies affect the performance of a nation-state, but they also explain differences in performance at the more granular levels of industries and companies.

Nobel Prize winner Douglass North defines institutions as “the rules of the game in a society.”4 Institutions are one ingredient in organizing, but I intend for my definition of STs to be somewhat broader and include other ingredients such as structures, roles, processes, and cultural norms. Social Technologies include all the elements necessary for organizing.
>
> ... In his thought-provoking book, Non Zero, the journalist and science writer Robert Wright argues that much of human history can be viewed as the outcome of this central tension between cooperation and self-interest. Wright claims that the process of bootstrapping social complexity, from simple hunter-gatherer tribes to organized villages to nation-states and global corporations, has been the result of humans innovating new ways to cooperate across larger and larger scales and devising ways to play increasingly complex and profitable non-zero-sum games. He notes that in a world where resources are finite at any given moment, there are competitive pressures to cooperate. Over time, societies that are better able to organize themselves will socially, economically, and militarily dominate societies that are less successful at creating cooperative structures. Thus, it is the competition to cooperate that drives social innovation.
>
> Recasting Wright’s thesis in the language we have developed, we can view the deductive-tinkering search through the ST fitness landscape as a quest for STs that enable people to play and capture the benefits of non-zero-sum games. Social Technology fitness will therefore depend on three factors. First, the ST must provide the potential for non-zero-sum payoffs. Second, it must provide methods for allocating the payoffs in such a way that people have an incentive to play the game. And third, the ST must have mechanisms for managing the problem of defection. Let’s take a closer look at each factor.
>
> Non-Zero Magic
>
> There are four basic sources of 1 + 1 = 3 magic in non-zero-sum games. All four have been well known to Traditional Economic theory for a long time. First is the division of labor... Second is the heterogeneity of people. Their different needs and tastes create opportunities to trade for mutual benefit... Third are the benefits of increasing returns to scale... Fourth, and finally, cooperation helps smooth out uncertainties over time...
>
> Dividing the Spoils
>
> These four sources of non-zero-sum gains can be mixed and matched in various contexts to create a near-infinite number of ways that people can cooperate for their mutual benefit. But for people to have an incentive to cooperate, they must receive some share of the spoils. How the gains of cooperation are divided up is therefore a crucial question. If the rewards are distributed in the wrong way, then cooperation collapses and the non-zero-sum gains evaporate. Allocating the payoffs from cooperation is where John Nash (profiled in the popular book and film A Beautiful Mind) first made his mark with a brilliant paper in 1950 titled “The Bargaining Problem.”15 In the paper, Nash asked the simple question, how will two bargainers come to agreement? How much meat will Harry give Larry for the hand ax? As simple as it sounds, the problem stumped economists for generations. Nash’s elegant solution was to say that how two or more bargainers split up the gains from exchange depends on how much each values the benefits of the deal, and what the parties’ alternatives are. Each looks for his or her best deal assuming everyone else is looking for the best deal, too, and the trade is made at the point at which no one has any incentive to change position, given the actions of the other. This point became known as the Nash equilibrium. Thus, as Harry and Larry haggle over the ax, they eventually find a point at which both are happy to trade and neither can improve his position without blowing the deal—they make the trade. Both walk away better off than they would have been had they not traded at all, thus capturing the non-zero-sum gains of cooperation. But the existence of a Nash equilibrium does not guarantee a happy, cooperative result. In the single-round Prisoner’s Dilemma, the Nash equilibrium is the solution in which both prisoners rat on each other and go to jail. This is because, if you are one of the prisoners and you don’t know whether your colleague will talk or stay silent, you are better off talking. As your colleague in crime faces the same incentives, you can assume that he will talk, too. Nash’s theorem tells us that for non-zero-sum games to result in cooperation, either the payoffs need to be structured such that everyone’s best response is to cooperate, or the players need some mechanism for coordinating their responses. For example, let’s say the prisoners have a mafia boss who promises to kill anyone who testifies and to reward anyone who keeps quiet after being released from jail. That would change the payoff structure and move the Nash equilibrium to a point at which both clam up and go free. Likewise, if the prisoners were allowed to communicate and knew what the other had been offered, they could coordinate their responses and avoid the defection trap. This last solution, however, would still have the possibility that one prisoner could nevertheless sell out the other for gain; after all, there is no honor among thieves. This leads to our third critical factor in ST fitness; for STs to be fit, they must have mechanisms for dealing with those who don’t play nice.
>
> Cheaters (Mostly) Never Win and Winners (Mostly) Never Cheat
>
> The incentive to cheat means that cooperation is inherently difficult to achieve and potentially unstable even once attained... The selfish logic of biological evolution says that if cheaters cheat and get away with it, they improve their chances of passing their cheating genes onto their offspring. Thus, cheating confers an evolutionary advantage. But if biological selection gives cheating genes an advantage over sucker genes, how, then, does cooperation get a foothold in a population? The answer is that the gains from cooperation are so powerful that cooperating genes have an advantage over cheating genes—but only if the genes aren’t naive, don’t let themselves be suckers, and ensure that cheaters get punished. To survive, cooperating genes need some sophisticated defense mechanisms. Recall our earlier discussion of Kristian Lindgren’s model. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, if the players play for just one round, both players have an incentive to rat on each other. When the game is repeated, however, and no one knows when it will end, the dynamics become much more complex. The types of robust, successful strategies that evolve usually have a logic along the lines of this: “I will begin on the assumption of mutual cooperation. If you cheat on me, however, not only will I refuse to cooperate, but I will punish you, even to my own near-term detriment. After some time, though, I might forgive you and try cooperating again, just in case your cheating was an error or a miscommunication, or on the chance you have reformed your ways. If, however, you cheat again, the probability of my forgiving you again will become lower and my punishment even more terrible.” Just as evolution produced this kind of logic in the world of Lindgren’s computer model, so too did evolution produce this kind of logic in the minds and instincts of our ancestors. Earlier in the book, we discussed a series of experiments called the ultimatum game in which researchers gave two subjects a pool of money and asked one person to decide on how to split it, and if the other agreed the split was fair, each could keep his or her share. If the partner rejected the split, however, neither got any money. The results of these reciprocity experiments were striking. Economic logic says that people should accept any offer of a split, no matter how small, because some money is always better than no money. In test after test, however, subjects rejected offers that were perceived as unfair, even to their own detriment. The results were consistent across cultures around the world, including hunter-gatherer cultures. Other games and experiments confirm the consistent and deep-rooted nature of human cooperative-reciprocity behavior. Evolution has steered us in a direction whereby we are naturally inclined to be cooperative to capture the riches of non-zero-sum gains. Nevertheless, it has also equipped us with a sensitivity to cheating, expectations of fairness, and a willingness to mete out punishment to those we believe have crossed the line. In effect, evolution has programmed into our mental software sophisticated, intuitive “Nash equilibrium finders” and “fairness detectors” that enable groups of humans to form coalitions that are at least reasonably stable and resistant to attack by free riders and cheaters. Our reciprocity software, however, is not hardwired—it can adapt to local circumstances. When we are in an environment in which most of our experience is of other people’s cooperation and reciprocation and in which social norms give us signals that people can be trusted (e.g., people tell admiring stories about self-sacrificing, trustworthy types), then our mental cooperation software will tend to be biased toward cooperating. It also will be more surprised and more forgiving when it encounters an example of defection or cheating. In essence, our minds statistically sample the population around us, and if people are usually cooperative, then when we encounter a cheater, we will tend to assume that the person’s behavior is probably the result of an error or misunderstanding. In contrast, in a low-cooperation, high-cheating environment with social norms that don’t support cooperation (e.g., the stories are all about thieves, and people tell you to “watch your back”), our cognitive cooperation software biases us toward being suspicious. We react harshly to the first signs of cheating, forgive only slowly if at all, and are likely to resist cooperating until given a sign of cooperation from the other party first. The local tuning of reciprocity norms can create very complex dynamics at the level of populations. High-cooperation societies can see collapses in cooperation if cheating reaches a critical mass; low-cooperation societies can get stuck in uncooperative, economically impoverished dead ends; and when people from different cooperative traditions mix, it can lead to misunderstanding and turmoil... Thus, Social Technologies that are better at tapping into sources of nonzero-sum gains, finding cooperative Nash equilibriums for allocating those gains, and managing the defection problem will be higher on the fitness landscape than those that do not. As people have deductively tinkered their way across the landscape in search of fit STs, humankind has evolved increasingly complex and sophisticated social structures for addressing these three issues.
>
> ... From the biological heritage of our primate origins, we inherited an inclination to cooperate for mutual gain and a compulsion to compete in dominance hierarchies, and eventually our developing human brains gave us language. From these humble beginnings sprang an evolutionary process of deductive-tinkering over tens of thousands of years as humans experimented with various ways of organizing their social and economic activities. The inherent non-zero-sum riches found in cooperation rewarded those STs that worked, and over time, humankind found increasingly effective Good Tricks for organizational success. As our species evolved its way through the rough-correlated landscape of ST design space, people were able to build on the tricks that worked, with each successful innovation yielding the possibility of even more future possibilities. As such innovations improved the ability of organizations to process information and solve problems, richer and richer areas of the ST fitness landscape were opened up. Simultaneously, ST space coevolved with Physical Technology space as discoveries in each sphere fed new possibilities in the other." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "A business is a person, or an organized group of people, who transforms matter, energy, and information from one state into another with the goal of making a profit... A firm is one or more businesses controlled in common by a person or group of people... What are the units of selection in economic evolution? Given that units of selection are sections of schemata, they must be bits of Business Plans. But which bits? How would we recognize them? And at what level of granularity? Is a unit of selection, for example, a marketing strategy, or might it be the Physical Technology for a particular product?... It sounds a bit circular to say that the units of selection are whatever the environment is selecting for (and against). But we have no choice; fitness functions are highly complex, multidimensional, and change over time. One cannot say a priori what the system is selecting for; one can only observe selection retrospectively, and thus only take an empirical, backward-looking approach to defining units of selection... Thus, a “gene” is merely a convenient label for bits of schemata scattered along the DNA and involved in coding for a heritable trait that could provide some basis for differential survival and reproduction. We will take a similarly pragmatic and empirical approach in identifying the units of selection in economic evolution and define a new term, a module, as follows: 'A module is a component of a Business Plan that has provided in the past, or could provide in the future, a basis for differential selection between businesses in a competitive environment.'
>
> ... The only alternative selection system to Big Men that humans have thus far devised is markets... One of the great accomplishments of Traditional Economics was to show in effect that the fitness function that markets attempt to satisfy is the overall welfare of the people participating in them. In a Big Man economy, a business lives or dies by political favor. In a market-based economy, a business lives or dies by whether its customers like and are willing to pay for its products and services. In a Big Man economy, resources are directed toward the ventures that best line the pockets of the Big Men. In a market economy, resources are directed to ventures that make the best economic use of them. All economies throughout history have in truth been some mixture of Big Men and markets. People in our hunter-gatherer past were often free to trade with each other as long as it didn’t displease the Big Man, and assuming he got his cut... For the vast bulk of human history, though, Big Men have dominated Business Plan selection, and markets have played either a secondary or an underground role... Market economies are systems of evolutionarily competing hierarchies... Recalling the biological maxim “good replicators replicate,” one can take a “module’s eye” view in the economic world and see that “good amplifiers amplify. Thus, we can see a variety of mechanisms at work for transmitting and amplifying Business Plan modules. They include the mental simulation and decision making of a single person, the problem solving and decision making of a group, imitation within and outside an organization, the direction of resources toward successful modules by the market, and the takeover of one business by another.
>
> ... Traditional Economics emphasizes that markets are the best method for allocating resources in a way that optimizes the welfare of society under equilibrium conditions. The problem, as we have seen, is that in the real world, equilibrium conditions are never met. But if the equilibrium assumptions of Traditional Economics are wrong, how can we be sure markets are a good thing? Following the framework I have just outlined, we can reinterpret markets as an evolutionary search mechanism. Markets provide incentives for the deductive-tinkering process of differentiation. They then critically provide a fitness function and selection process that represents the broad needs of the population (and not just the needs of a few Big Men). Finally, they provide a means of shifting resources toward fit modules and away from unfit ones, thus amplifying the fit modules’ influence.” In short, the reason that markets work so well comes down to what evolutionary theorists refer to as Orgel’s Second Rule (named after biochemist Leslie Orgel), which says, “Evolution is cleverer than you are.” Even a highly rational, intelligent, benevolent Big Man would not be able to beat an evolutionary algorithm in finding peaks in the economic fitness landscape. Markets win over command and control, not because of their efficiency at resource allocation in equilibrium, but because of their effectiveness at innovation in disequilibrium. Complexity economists don’t ignore the allocative role of markets. They tend to think markets are pretty good at that, too, and generally better than the Big Man alternative. But while Traditional economists like to talk about the “perfect efficiency” of markets in equilibrium, Complexity economists often view market efficiency as a more relative notion. The Complexity view is that an ideal state of perfect efficiency may not actually exist, and even if it did, the disequilibrium nature of markets would probably prevent it from ever being reached. Markets can never be perfectly efficient, just as the engine of a car can never be made 100 percent thermodynamically efficient. The reason that markets are good at allocation has more to do with their computational efficiency as a distributed processing system (i.e., they get the right signals to the right people), than with their ability to reach a mythical global equilibrium. The empirical record of markets points to their success as an evolutionary mechanism. As the economist William Baumol has said, free markets have historically been “innovation machines.”

> ... a set of innovations in Social Technologies significantly boosted the clock-speed of economic evolution itself. In chapter 11, we discussed the first meta-innovation, the scientific revolution. Prior to 1500, human knowledge was primarily built by trial and error. The advent of science accelerated the pace of human search through Physical Technology space and vastly increased the effectiveness of both rational deduction and experimental tinkering. The second meta-innovation was the rise of organized markets. The development of market-based economies did not occur in a big bang, but rather was the result of two centuries of ST evolution. Two key events that initiated this change were the creation of parliamentary democracy in England, and the American Revolution." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "Economic wealth and biological wealth are thermodynamically the same sort of phenomena, and not just metaphorically. Both are systems of locally low entropy, patterns of order that evolved over time under the constraint of fitness functions. Both are forms of fit order. And the fitness function of the economy—our tastes and preferences—is fundamentally linked to the fitness function of the biological world—the replication of genes. The economy is ultimately a genetic replication strategy... If wealth is indeed fit order, then we can use another more familiar word to describe it. In physics, order is the same thing as information, and thus we can also think of wealth as fit information; in other words, knowledge. Information on its own can be worthless. Knowledge on the other hand is information that is useful, that we can do something with, that is fit for some purpose. So we have come full circle; the founder of Traditional growth theory, Robert Solow, was right. The origin of wealth is knowledge. Yet rather than treating knowledge as an assumption, an exogenous input, a mysterious process outside the bounds of economics, the Complexity-based view I have outlined puts the creation of knowledge at the endogenous heart of the economy. Evolution is a knowledge-creation machine—a learning algorithm... The sheer volume of knowledge in the econosphere is as staggering as that in the biosphere. The econosphere, too, was created by differentiate, select, amplify, and repeat. We have found the answer to our quest. Wealth is knowledge and its origin is evolution." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)

> "We may not be able to predict or direct economic evolution, but we can design our institutions and societies to be better or worse evolvers... The message of Complexity Economics is that evolution may indeed be cleverer than we are, but rather than outsmart it, we can understand it and harness its power to serve human purposes... In evolutionary systems, sustainable competitive advantage does not exist; there is only a never-ending race to create new sources of temporary advantage... Companies Don’t Innovate; Markets Do... Markets are highly dynamic, but the vast majority of companies are not... Companies are Big Man (today we should say, Big Person) hierarchies with all their human foibles and distortions, while markets are almost pure evolutionary machines. Companies have an inherent disadvantage in that they can never have the same diversity of Business Plans as contained in the market as a whole. Nor can they ever perfectly mirror the selection pressures of actual markets or have the nearly infinite resources of the capital markets to invest in amplifying and scaling up Business Plans that succeed... Strategy is about making long-term commitments that will result in competitive advantage. But we can’t predict the future very well due to the contingencies of frozen accidents. Furthermore, competitive advantage is rare, temporary, and appears to be lasting ever-shorter amounts of time. Finally, evidence shows that the vast majority of companies are poor runners in the Red Queen race and unable to keep up with the pace of adaptation in their markets. The question then is, can we do better? Can we design companies that are more adaptable than those we have today? And specifically, can we avoid the problem of prediction and develop a more robust and adaptable approach to strategy?
>
> Strategy as a Portfolio of Experiments
>
> The key to doing better is to “bring evolution inside” and get the wheels of differentiation, selection, and amplification spinning within a company’s four walls. Rather than thinking of strategy as a single plan built on predictions of the future, we should think of strategy as a portfolio of experiments, a population of competing Business Plans that evolves over time... There are some general lessons that can be learned from a portfolio-of-experiments approach to strategy. First, management needs to create a context for strategy. Constructing a portfolio of experiments requires a collective understanding of the current situation and shared aspirations among the management team. Second, management needs a process for differentiating Business Plans that results in a portfolio of diverse Plans. Third, the organization needs to create a selection environment that mirrors the environment in the market. Fourth and finally, processes need to be established that enable the amplification of successful Business Plans and the elimination of unsuccessful Plans.
>
> ... Instead of taking big, risky bets to innovate, take many small ones and only bet big on stuff that works. Pursuing multiple Business Plans at the same time does not necessarily mean ambiguity if there is clarity in the selection pressures for good plans and bad plans. And while senior executives cannot necessarily control the outcomes of their strategic experiments, they can control the process of creating, selecting, and amplifying experiments to increase their odds of success. In many ways, an adaptive mind-set is the opposite of what is conventionally considered a visionary approach. An adaptive mind-set is highly pragmatic. It values tangible facts about today more than guesses about tomorrow, doesn’t expect that everything will work out as planned, and prefers lots of small failures to big ones. Above all, an adaptive mind-set is willing to say, “We learned something new; we need to change course.”" - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "CHAPTER 16: Organization

> ... We will define a social architecture as having three components: • The behaviors of the individual people in the organization. • The structures and processes that align people and resources in pursuit of an organization’s goals. • The culture that emerges from the interactions of people in the organization with each other and their environment... we will use a definition from Howard Aldrich, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina: 'Organizations are goal directed, boundary-maintaining, and socially constructed systems of human activity.'

> ... In short, Coase said, if it is cheaper to freelance, people will freelance, but if it is cheaper to pull people together into an organization, they will. We can update Coase’s idea for our evolutionary framework and say that not only might organizations be cheaper mechanisms for cooperation in some circumstances, but they might also enable people to reach parts of Business Plan design space unobtainable just by contracting. In short, organizations are better vehicles for exploiting Business Plan space and thus better vehicles for wealth creation. There are four reasons for this.
>
> First is a problem that economists refer to as incomplete contracts. No matter how clever the lawyers are, no contract can ever cover all possible contingencies; life is simply too complex. The more complex the cooperation required, the more likely the contract will be incomplete. The problem of incomplete contracts restricts freelancing to relatively simple parts of Business Plan space.
>
> Second is a factor economists call the holdup problem. As discussed, wealth creation requires hard-to-reverse commitments. Often, those commitments take the form of investments in specific assets. As the name implies, such assets are designed to do something specific for a production process, but are not much use for other purposes. For example, a pizza oven is terrific at baking pizzas, but not very useful for cooking other things. The problem of incomplete contracts means that in a group of freelancers, there is always a risk that the contracts will unravel and someone will be stuck with expensive and hard-to-sell specific assets. The other freelancers can then “hold up” the owner of the assets and threaten to quit unless they get a better deal. By creating shared ownership of assets and aligning the interests of participants, organizations reduce the risk of investing in specific assets and making hard-to-reverse commitments.
>
> Third, organizations provide a structure for cooperation to endure over long periods, even as the specific agents involved change. Some projects take many years to complete—for example, discovering, testing, and producing a new drug can take a decade or more. Yet individual human beings do inconvenient things like quit, get fired, move to another company, get sick, or even die. If GlaxoSmithKline had to disband and restart every time someone left the company, it would not get much done. By creating cooperative structures that outlive the participation of individual agents, organizations again enable us to reach for much more complex Business Plans than we could obtain in a purely freelance economy.
>
> Fourth and finally, organizations provide a vehicle for collective learning... stigmergy... We cooperatively create artifacts that contain embedded information, and we change our behavior in response to the information embedded in those artifacts... Organizations are full of documents, diagrams, computers, and other physical artifacts that enable stimergistic learning, despite a changing cast of agents. Following our framework from part 3, organizations thus play the critical role of providing a storehouse, or a collective memory, for schemata.

> ... “exploration” and “exploitation.” ... it is no coincidence that this yin-yang theme of opposing challenges keeps cropping up. But as we saw in the previous chapter, the evidence suggests that companies are generally better at the executing half of the dialectic than the adapting half. Some might argue that this is just the natural order of things, that economic evolution is best handled at the market level and organizations should merely be execution machines. Let markets explore and firms exploit. But there is an argument to be made that greater intracompany adaptation would be better for society. Adaptation reduces the frictional losses associated with company failures and unemployment. When a company fails to adapt, the intransigence can have tragic consequences for individual lives and local communities. In addition, the lack of organizational adaptability is not strictly a concern of businesses. Many other types of organizations, ranging from nonprofits, to governments and military bodies, suffer from the same issue. Now that we have a perspective on what organizations are and why they exist, we can begin to examine why their performance on the executing side versus the adapting side of the equation is so heavily weighted toward execution. Using the perspective that organizations are complex adaptive systems, we will examine them from three levels: ...
>
> Individuals: Through Rose-Colored Glasses
>
> How well an organization adapts is partly a function of the adaptability of the minds of the individuals in it. This is a question not only of the minds at the top, but also of the minds up and down the hierarchy... We will look at four reasons for poor individual adaptability: First, people have a bias toward overoptimism, which can reduce the felt need for change. Second, people also have a natural bias toward loss aversion, making them less likely to take certain kinds of risks. Third, the way we categorize the world and structure our mental models can get in the way of change. And fourth, the punctuated-equilibrium nature of change tends to favor leadership styles that are more rigid than ones that are more flexible. To begin changing their mental models, people must first perceive a need to change. They must see a gap between their goals and the current state and trajectory of the world. Moreover, fundamental change often requires that people believe something bad will happen unless things change... As Lovallo and Kahneman note: “The bearers of bad news tend to become pariahs, shunned and ignored by other employees. When pessimistic opinions are suppressed, while optimistic ones are rewarded, an organization’s ability to think critically is undermined. The optimistic biases of individual employees become mutually reinforcing, and unrealistic views of the future are validated by the group.” This means that one is likely to find a greater proportion of optimists as one gets nearer the top of the organizational ladder. This then creates a barrier to adaptability because the optimists feel a less acute need to change than do realists...
>
> Individuals: Adaptability and Loss Aversion
>
> ... This general bias toward loss aversion naturally makes companies more cautious in exploring and more focused on exploiting. Exploring is by definition a more uncertain activity, and more fraught with downside risk. But there is a more subtle effect as well. In judging risk, people tend to look at relative scale rather than absolute scale. A CEO might view a $100 million decision as a big bet and be loss averse, but view a $1 million decision as small potatoes and be much less loss averse. A midlevel manager, however, might view the $1 million decision with the same trepidation as that felt by the CEO over the $100 million bet. This means that both decisions might be treated with the same level of risk aversion. Yet logically, the organization should be far more risk averse toward the $100 million bet. But the punishment for the middle manager (e.g., getting fired) for blowing a $1 million bet is personally just as negative as the pain for the CEO on losing his or her $100 million bet—in fact, the CEO, strapped into a golden parachute, might actually have a softer fall. As Kahneman points out, this gamblers’ relativism means that organizations are often too risk averse for small bets made at lower levels of the hierarchy, and insufficiently risk averse for large bets made at the top levels... When companies deny themselves a portfolio of small risks, they get strategically boxed in and end up placing all their chips on big-bet investments and on mergers and acquisitions...
>
> Individuals: The Price of Experience
>
> In chapter 6, we discussed how the cognitive scientist John Holland and his colleagues portray human mental models as organized into “default hierarchies.” Concepts are grouped together in hierarchical structures (e.g., small, blue, buzzing things are categorized as “flies”), and our decision-action rules use specific information when we have it, but fall back on default rules when things are uncertain. The structure of a default hierarchy has a great benefit in that it allows people to take action even when they don’t have complete information. And it allows people to fine-tune their actions and learn as they get more specific information and experience. On the down side, this structure can make experience a double-edged sword.29 When we are young and inexperienced, our default hierarchies are fairly shallow, so our views of the world are more general than specific. This way of thinking has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that our mental models are easily changeable. New experiences are readily absorbed, and reorganizing the hierarchy is not very difficult, because there isn’t that much to reorganize. The disadvantage is that there is a lower probability of having the right response to a given situation... As we gain experience with age, our default hierarchies fill up and the situation reverses. We have a larger collection of specific experiences and more feedback on what has worked and what has not. Our mental models grow into highly complex structures of categories, interlinked rules, and weightings. We become less likely to perceive anything as totally new, and instead try to relate new knowledge to previous experiences and group those experiences into existing categories. Once in a while, we encounter something outside our realm of experience, and we then have to create a new, high-level category or rearrange existing categories. As our mental models become more complex, such major rearrangements become more difficult. Reorganizing an older, more experienced mental model is like reorganizing General Motors, whereas reorganizing a younger, less experienced model is more akin to reorganizing a small startup. Our mental models thus tend to settle over time, and it takes progressively bigger and bigger shocks to shake them up. In essence, we balance exploring and exploiting over our lifetimes. The early emphasis is on exploring while we form our mental models and get feedback from the environment, but eventually we settle into a groove, and the emphasis shifts to exploiting the model we have developed. This is not an “ageist” argument, and certainly there are examples of fuddy-duddy twenty-year-olds and adaptable seventy-year-olds. But in broad terms, the structures of our mental models do change over time, and there are strengths and weaknesses at each stage of development. The implications for organizations, however, are important. Stable mental models work well in stable environments, which is to say, most of the time. However, as we noted previously, the punctuated nature of change in complex adaptive systems is almost perniciously designed to lull our pattern-recognizing, rule-building minds into a sense of stability and then hit us with big changes. Firms tend to be organized as hierarchies, with the people who are most experienced sitting at the top. This arrangement presents a trade-off: the mental models at the top are likely to be some of the best for the purposes of execution in a stable environment, but less capable of exploring, and less likely to adapt to environmental shifts. The result can be significant inertia in an organization when environmental change does occur. This mental model inertia helps explain why many turnaround situations involve wholesale changes in top management. It is often easier and faster to simply change the people than to change their mental models. If resistance to change in experienced mental models is a deep feature of human cognition, then how can we guard against it? A good starting point is simple acknowledgment of it at the top. Those running organizations must recognize that, while their wisdom may be highly valuable, their sensitivity to change and flexibility may be low. Likewise, their seniority may intimidate junior people, who are usually more aware of changes in the environment and have different perspectives... To make a diversity of mental models effective, however, the senior leadership team must also embrace a nonhierarchical culture that is open to challenge and debate...

> Individuals: “Rigids” Versus “Flexibles”
>
> ... Harrington notes that the less frequent, more abrupt, and more severe the transitions, the more dominant the Rigids are and the more disastrous the situation is when the environment actually shifts. In environments that are more continuously volatile, the Flexibles tend to do better. Harrington measured the economic efficiency of his model organizations during these transitions and found that the amount of economic loss was directly related to the number of Flexibles the organization managed to hold on to during the stable period. Organizations that drove out the Flexibles and were dominated by Rigids tended to do very well during the stable period (e.g., met all their earnings targets), but then really blew up when the punctuation point hit. In contrast, organizations that managed to hang on to a reserve of Flexibles and maintained a better mix between the two types did somewhat worse during the stable era (they were less efficient), but managed the adaptive transitions much more smoothly.

> Structure: How Much Hierarchy?
>
> ... Jack Welch has referred to structure as the “hardware” side of organization—the design of reporting relationships, managerial processes, and the configuration of the firm’s resources. Earlier in the book, we discussed the beneficial role that hierarchy plays in organizations. It enables the network structure to be organized in such a way that decisions can be made without everyone having to talk to everyone else, and thus prevent the gridlock of complexity catastrophes. Organizations with insufficient hierarchy have difficulty changing and adapting because the density of communications is too high, and the need for consensus slows down decision making... In this section, we will see that hierarchy, while necessary, can also get in the way of adaptability. Scott Page, a political scientist and associate director of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan, has examined the question, why do organizations evolve different amounts of hierarchy? Why are some organizations broad and flat, while others are narrow and deep?... Page posited that organizations evolve to match the nature and difficulty of the problems they are trying to solve. In rough terms, if the problem can easily be chunked into parallel tasks and doesn’t require much sequencing, then the organization will reflect this simplicity and tend to be broad and flat. If the problem cannot be easily divided up and has numerous sequential steps, then the organizational hierarchy will tend to be narrow and deep... Consequently, companies rarely see exploration activities arising organically out of their mainstream execution hierarchies—it is a mismatch between the organizational structure and the nature of the problem. It is also why at many companies, when senior management sees a need for exploration, they pull small teams out of the hierarchy, put them in separate buildings, and create various forms of Skunk Works to pursue innovation initiatives. Such initiatives can be successful. Apple Computer’s Macintosh, for example, was famously developed by a small, autonomous team with a pirate flag flying from the mast of its separate building. Skunk Works that are separate from the execution hierarchy may often be the only way to address this mismatch. But there are two pitfalls that such approaches often run into. First, if all such exploration initiatives are run and funded by the corporate center, then the organization will inevitably explore only a limited section of the fitness landscape—the section that happens to be on the radar screen of senior management. Second, there are often problems reintegrating such initiates back into the mainstream organization. Reintegration is, of course, essential if a successful initiative is eventually to be amplified. Both issues are made easier when, in addition to the corporate portfolio, the business units also have the resources and autonomy to run portfolios of experiments themselves. This enables a broader exploration of the landscape and provides a more natural path for reintegrating successful initiatives back into the organization.
>
> Structure: The Coevolution of Resources and Business Plans
>
> ... In short, resources are what management teams draw on to exploit opportunities... But as plans are executed, management changes the configuration of resources and thus changes the space of possible future Business Plans. There is thus a continuous, coevolutionary loop between Business Plans and firm resources. This coevolution between plans and resources creates path dependence in the structure of organizations and provides another important barrier to adaptation... Major changes in industry and strategic focus can successfully occur, but in a step-by-step evolutionary fashion, rather than through single leaps... Penrose’s theory further reinforces the need for portfolios of strategic experiments. Not only do such portfolios create a greater diversity of Business Plans within organizations, but the initiatives in such portfolios also create a greater diversity of resources...
>
> Culture: Rules of Behavior
>
> ... I will use a definition that fits with our evolutionary framework, but is similar in spirit to a widely used definition from the anthropologists Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson: 'Culture is an emergent characteristic of a group of agents and is determined by the agents’ rules of behavior (or norms) for acting in their social environment and for interacting with each other. Cultural rules are socially transmitted and learned.' Cultural norms are in short the rules of thumb for behaving in a social environment. Norms are “should” or “ought” statements about what is considered the right, appropriate, or the expected thing to do, by the society or organization in a given situation. We can think of culture in an organizational context as a set of concentric rings, moving from the most widely shared norms, to ones that are more specific and individual. In the outermost ring are the norms that virtually all humans share. Evidence from anthropologists and cognitive scientists shows that a relatively small set of norms comes as standard equipment in human minds and is likely the product of our biological evolution. For example, murder is a universal prohibition, and likewise, as we saw earlier, all societies have norms about reciprocal behavior. The specific tunings of these basic norms, however, are accomplished through a process of imitation and teaching and are thus culturally transmitted. For example, what constitutes murder might differ by society (e.g., definitions of “honor” killings, self-defense, and war), and as we saw in chapter 6, what constitutes fairness might differ by society. Moving inward, to the next ring, we see a vast universe of culturally specific norms. These norms have evolved in particular societies and are transmitted from person to person over time, from parent to child, from teacher to student, from boss to worker, from friend to friend, and so on. Culturally specific norms are spread through a variety of channels, such as stories, music, religion, writing, and the media. These norms often cover a very wide set of behaviors, ranging from sexual norms, to how guests are treated, to how to signal respect for another person. Such rules of behavior produce endless sources of friction when people from different cultures collide, as well as endless sources of humor when tourists try to navigate their way in a strange country. Within the broad swath of societal norms, there are often subgroups, and sub-subgroups, as determined by geography, religion, or other factors... We can then locate organizational culture at the next ring heading inward. Organizational cultures always exist in the broader context of societal cultures and, more generally, human culture. But organizations, including companies, develop their own unique cultures over time. We can think of these as the rules of behavior for interacting within a specific organization. For example, an organization might have a culture in which junior people feel free to speak up and express their views, or it might be an authoritarian culture in which junior staff defer to their seniors. Alternatively, a company might have a culture in which commitments are flexible and not taken very seriously, or one in which commitments are considered binding and there are serious consequences for missing them. The key is that these are organization-specific and not just general societal traits... Many companies and management books use the term values when discussing corporate culture, and we should distinguish between values and norms. Values are statements of belief about what is important, such as “we value an egalitarian approach to teamwork.” Norms, on the other hand, are statements with “should” or “ought” in them, such as “you should behave in a nonhierarchical way when working in teams.” Values and norms tend to go in pairs of beliefs and behaviors (e.g., egalitarian beliefs and nonhierarchical behaviors). Many companies use the terms interchangeably, but I will use the terms norms, or cultural rules, to emphasize that what matters is the translation into individual behavior. Finally, located in the innermost circle are individual norms. Every person has an individual set of rules of behavior that he or she follows... The way we can distinguish between idiosyncratic norms and organizational, societal, or human norms is to ask how widely shared the norms are. For example, one person in her youth might learn that individual initiative is rewarded, while another might come to believe that the best policy is to keep her head down and go with the flow. If initiative taking is a common feature in a society, then we would say it is a broad societal norm; if it is randomly scattered in the society but common in a particular organization, then initiative taking would be an organizational norm. Finally, if this rule of behavior was randomly scattered in the organization, but certain individuals had it, then it would be an individual norm.

> Culture: The Ten Commandments
>
> ... But just as Tolstoy famously said, “All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” a handful of traits seem to crop up with regularity in studies of the cultures of high-performing and adaptive companies. I have collected some of these traits into a list of ten norms... I have grouped the norms into three categories. The first relates to individual performance: “how should I behave when I am on my own and no one is watching?” The second describes cooperative behavior: “how should I behave when interacting with others?” And the third describes behaviors that facilitate exploration and innovation.

> Culture: Inherent Tensions
>
> Each of these norms plays a critical role in the executing-versus-adapting story and in reducing the dependency of the organization on structure and process. Individual performance norms clearly have an important impact on execution. But they also play a role in adaptation. If individual performance norms are deeply embedded in an organization and succeed in driving individual behavior, then the hierarchy and processes don’t have to be quite so tight and restrictive to achieve good performance. If the hierarchy and centralized control processes don’t have to be so tight, this in turn enables the organization to have more slack resources for experimentation and to drive responsibility closer to the frontline. When individual performance norms are poor, the hierarchy tends to crack down and tighten processes, perhaps succeeding in boosting execution, but damaging the organization’s ability to adapt. Cooperative norms also have important effects on both adaptation and execution. In low-trust, low-cooperation environments, interactions between agents must be spelled out in great detail, with numerous rules and little flexibility. One sees this in organizations in which labor and management have poor relations and unions have stepped in with detailed contracts that specify which person can pick up which screwdriver. Norms that foster trust and cooperation allow people to use their brains to determine what is best, given the circumstances, creating both better performance and the possibility of experimentation and improvement. Finally, norms for individual performance, trust, and cooperative behavior are all necessary but not sufficient conditions for adaptation. There must be an additional set of norms that push individuals to explore and take risks. Furthermore, there must be norms that help protect such individuals in the organization (e.g., norms 7 and 9) and give them the space to innovate... The reality for most organizations, however, is that they truly live few, if any, of these norms. Despite what may be written on posters in the company lobby or on plastic cubes on people’s desks, at many companies, values and culture are not top management priorities. In such companies, the culture evolves organically through the interactions of employees, with little shaping by senior management. Such organizational cultures tend to be a mixture of strengths and weaknesses. For example, some organizations may be strong on individual performance norms, but weak on cooperative norms, or vice versa. There are inherent tensions between the norms in the top-ten list, for example, the tensions between an intense, performance-oriented meritocracy and the need for teamwork. Unless these tensions are actively managed through senior leadership and reinforced by the structural side of the organization, some subset of the norms inevitably comes to dominate. It is thus virtually impossible for a set of norms that is balanced across individual performance, cooperation, and innovation to arise organically without strong leadership.

> Creating an Adaptive Social Architecture

> We have touched on a number of factors that might explain why organizations generally don’t adapt as quickly or successfully as markets do:

> Individuals
>
> • Human mental models tend to be biased toward optimism, dulling our ability to recognize the need for change. 
>
> • A natural bias toward loss aversion causes people to systematically underinvest in experimentation. 
>
> • As our mental models gain experience in a stable environment, they become more effective in that environment, but at the price of reduced flexibility.

>
> Structure
>
> • The challenges of executing complex production and service processes drive organizations to develop deep, densely connected hierarchies. Yet these structures are not well suited to the tasks of exploration, which require flatter, more autonomous organizational structures. 
>
> • The coevolutionary relationship between Business Plans and resources constrains the space of Business Plans that a firm can explore, and path dependence in resources limits the ability and speed with which an organization can shift to a new Business Plan. 
>
> Culture
>
> • Strong cultural norms are critical to adaptability because they enable organizations to reduce centralized hierarchical control without sacrificing execution performance. 
>
> • There are, however, inherent tensions in cultural norms that encourage individual performance, cooperation, and innovation; these tensions must be actively managed by the organization’s senior leadership.
>
> Executing and adapting appear to be irreconcilable opposites, and the empirical data we discussed in the previous chapter suggests that most companies are destined to favor the former over the latter. But by understanding the sources of this schism, we can also begin to see the outlines of a potential solution. By shifting the central lever of management from the hardware of organizational structure to the software of culture, we can begin to address each of these issues.
>
> At a crude level, there are fundamentally only two ways of running a large organization. One is to use the structure of management hierarchy. We can define roles, goals, tasks, and procedures; then measure individual and group performance against those goals; and reward and punish accordingly. Such a structure serves to reduce the degrees of freedom of individual agents and constrain them to desired behaviors. The benefits of this approach are control, reliability, and predictability. Using the structure lever increases the odds that people will do what they are supposed to do, and not do what they are not supposed to do. Although I’ve described the use of hierarchy in rather unflattering terms, it can be very satisfying for people to have a well-defined role, interesting tasks to carry out, and clear measures of success—particularly if it pays well. Without such hierarchical structures, we’d still be in caves rubbing sticks together to make fire.
>
> The second method still requires the skeleton of hierarchy, but uses less command-and-control muscle on the bones. Rather than using structure and process to guide individual behavior, an organization can rely more heavily on culture. The primary advantage of a culturally driven organization is that cultural rules tend to be more flexible than structures. Cultural rules provide general guidance, but leave the “how” up to the individual. In short, they require individuals to use their brains.
>
> Cultural rules can be used to address each of the issues we have identified. Overoptimism and risk aversion can be counterbalanced with cultural norms that encourage people to face reality, make fact-based decisions, and take thoughtful risks. Likewise, the entrenchment of senior mental models can be addressed by a nonhierarchical culture that creates not just an expectation that junior people will speak their minds, but an obligation (McKinsey calls this “the obligation to dissent”). The rigid-versus-flexible issue can be mitigated by a culture that embraces a diversity of management styles and that values both execution and innovation skill sets. Finally, the structural issues that tend to favor execution hierarchies over portfolios of experiments can also be offset by changes in culture. In particular, boosting individual performance and cooperation norms can enable a looser hierarchical structure without a consequent loss in near-term performance. This in turn enables resources and responsibility for experimentation to be pushed deeper into the organization.
>
> Moving to a more culturally led management approach does not mean abandoning the hardware of structure and process. On the contrary, as we have noted, a social architecture needs both. Rather, it means that the hardware and software sides of the organization must be consistent and mutually reinforcing. One can work backward and ask, if the objective is to better balance executing and adapting, then what kind of culture would support that objective, and what kind of structure and processes would support that culture? For example, if one of the desired norms is individual accountability, but there are no rewards for those who achieve targets, and no penalties for those who miss, then the norm will merely be empty words. Likewise, norms around innovating and risk taking need to be supported by a constellation of budgeting, human resources, and performance processes.
>
> Perhaps the most critical hardware levers in a social architecture are a company’s human resources and training processes. Rather than fight human nature, strong-culture companies recognize that it is far easier to hire the right people who culturally fit than it is to create them. Thus, these companies have a very strong perspective on what kind of candidates have the “right DNA” for the organization, and actively screen for those qualities. But even though the new hires might have the right raw material, strong-culture companies don’t assume that new hires will adopt the culture simply through osmosis. Instead, such companies have carefully engineered induction processes that introduce new recruits to the norms and then reinforce the norms in training and other programs throughout the person’s career. Evaluation and promotion further reinforce the culture by explicitly rewarding those who live the norms and by withholding rewards from, or punishing, those who do not. People receive a consistent message on the culture from these processes, literally from their first interview to retirement.
>
> Finally, senior management behavior and communications play an enormous role in building and perpetuating a culturally led social architecture. It is a cliché, but nonetheless true, that if senior management does not walk the talk and model the desired norms, then no one else will. As mentioned before, carefully balanced systems of cultural norms do not arise organically, and thus all strong-culture companies have sometime in their history had a CEO who played the role of chief cultural architect and enforcement officer. These individuals carefully designed the set of desired norms for their companies, personally and passionately ensured consistency against those norms by their senior team, drove the norms deep into their organizations, and then created mechanisms to ensure that the norms would be perpetuated. Over time, once a culture is well established, cultural design and enforcement can (and should) become the collective responsibility of the senior team, but during the crucial period when the culture is being built, there is no substitute for personal CEO leadership.
>
> Communications is also naturally important, and cognitive science tells us that most corporate change programs are 180 degrees backward. Humans are fairly stubborn creatures and don’t just immediately change their mental models and behaviors in responses to speeches from their bosses, or because of PowerPoint presentations or plastic cubes with inspirational messages. Instead of trying to appeal to our fact-based, deductive sides, corporate change programs need to address the story-loving, pattern-recognizing, more emotional, inductive side of human cognition. People need to be jolted from their existing mental models and see an urgent and personal gap between the way things are and the way things need to be. A change program needs to have a fact-based argument underlying it, but the emphasis in communications should be on stories, analogies, and patterns to help people see the issues. Most change programs are also very passive, with lots of communications cascading down from on high. But learning is interactive, and thus a change program needs to get people to personally grapple with the issues.
>
> Many executives find the idea of sound bites mildly distasteful and associate them with politicians. But the reality of human cognition is that we remember short, catchy, rhythmic phrases that use alliteration, metaphor, humorous twists, or other tricks. Jack Welch was the master of the carefully engineered sound bite and used them with great effect to drive norms of behavior into the GE organization. Finally, intense repetition is essential. There is a reason why religious leaders see their flocks weekly, and why politicians give the same stump speech until they are blue in the face—our minds tend to weight messages by frequency as much as quality...

> A Society of Minds
>
> One of the questions Edith Penrose asked in her Theory of the Growth of the Firm was, what, if any, are the fundamental constraints on firm size and growth? She identified two. The first is the ability to manage complexity. At some point, an organization can simply become, as Penrose put it, “too big … to be efficiently handled.” The outer envelope of this constraint, however, has continued to advance, as our Physical and Social Technologies have evolved. Clearly, it is easier to run a large, global organization with computers, telephones, airplanes, and modern management techniques than it is with letters, carrier pigeons, steamships, and nineteenth-century STs. Indeed, there is evidence that this constraint has loosened over time, as the average number of employees in a Fortune 500 company has nearly tripled, from around 16,000 in 1955 when the list was first published, to nearly 48,000 in 2003.
>
> The second constraint Penrose identified was knowledge. A firm can only grow as fast as its knowledge. And, since knowledge is the product of evolutionary processes, we can say that a firm can only grow as fast as its evolutionary processes allow it to grow. Although the size of organizations in the economy has grown, the shape of the distribution of both firm size and growth rates has remained remarkably stable. According to work by Robert Axtell at the Brookings Institution and Gene Stanley at Boston University, both are distributed according to our old friend, the power law. The existence of these power laws suggests that there are indeed constraints at work on the system. One can hypothesize that perhaps it is Penrose’s second constraint that is holding us back. Our PTs and STs have enabled organizations to develop coordinating, controlling, and executing abilities that are far ahead of their innovating and knowledge-creating abilities.
>
> If true, this means that we are operating at a level vastly below our human potential. The great cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky observed that what we call “intelligence” is not a singular thing; rather, it is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the collective interactions of many individual parts. The magic of intelligence is that when those parts are organized in a particular way, they can do things that no individual part could do on its own. Minsky called this description of intelligence “the society of mind.”
>
> We can think of human organizations as passing through three stages of development. The first stage was the evolution of STs that enabled strangers to reliably cooperate with each other. The second stage was the creation of large-scale organizations that could exploit the PTs of the industrial revolution. But perhaps now we are at the beginning of a third stage. We are only just now learning how to create “societies of minds” in our largest organizations.
>
> Most organizations tap only a small fraction of the brainpower of their people. The hierarchical command-and-control organizations that arose out of the industrial age enabled humans to achieve cooperation on scales once unimaginable and execute Business Plan designs of immense complexity. Nevertheless, the inherent rigidities of these structures ultimately limit them to being evolutionary fodder in the churnings of markets. But through the lever of culture, companies can create true societies within their organizations and free the minds of their people. As in any society, along with freedom comes responsibility, and the culture must support performance and execution, as well as exploration and adaptation. Creating such a culture is truly “social engineering” with all the consequent risks and unpredictability associated with the phrase. But for companies that succeed, the reward is the creation of institutions that can be engines of wealth creation for generations to come." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)

> "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN - Finance
>
> ... Traditional finance theory has developed its ideas into a rigorous and coherent theory that can take us all the way from the behavior of individual investors up to the movements of global markets. It is in many ways one of the most elegant and highly developed branches of Traditional Economics. Over the last two decades, however, reality has not been kind to the theory. As noted at the beginning of the chapter, events such as the crash of 1987 and the technology bubble of the 1990s have presented significant challenges to Traditional finance. But perhaps even more importantly, a new generation of empirical work using highly advanced statistical tools has called into question the theory’s core tenets. From the vantage point of this work, one can say that at best, the theory is a rough approximation that works under certain circumstances; at worst, one can say it is plain and simply wrong. To cut to the heart of the matter, we need to establish three salient facts:
>
> • First, a substantial body of empirical and experimental evidence shows that real-world investors look nothing like their theoretical, perfectly rational counterparts.12 Investors do not discount in the way Traditional theory assumes; they have various biases regarding risk, are subject to framing errors in processing information, and use heuristics to make decisions. As we discussed more generally in chapter 6, this does not mean that investors are irrational or make decisions purely on emotion. Rather, they are “boundedly” and inductively rational, instead of perfectly and deductively rational. Suffice it to say that three decades of work leaves little doubt that perfect rationality is a poor approximation of economic reality. 
>
> • Second, Bachelier was wrong. Markets do not follow a random walk. We will review evidence that market data has considerable structure, which has all the signature characteristics of a complex adaptive system. 
>
> • Third, financial markets are not efficient in the Traditional Economics sense of the word, but as we will see, they are highly effective in an evolutionary sense.
>
> ... In fact, the strong picture that Farmer got from his trading experience and research was that markets form a kind of evolving ecosystem. The markets are populated by heterogeneous traders and investors with a variety of mental models and strategies. As those agents interact with each other over time, they constantly learn and adapt their strategies—in fact, one could say they deductively-tinker their way through the Library of All Possible Investment Strategies. The complex interactions of these agents, their changing strategies, and new information from their environment causes patterns and trading opportunities to constantly appear and disappear over time. The Santa Fe Institute’s Brian Arthur poetically once called markets “ecosystems of expectations” to describe this interplay between agents and their strategies...
>
> A New Definition of Market Efficiency
>
> Are financial markets efficient? Examined through the lens of Complexity Economics, financial markets are an evolving ecosystem of competing trading strategies. Thus, asking whether markets are efficient makes about as much sense as asking whether the ecosystem of the Amazon rain forest is efficient. Efficient compared to what?
>
> We can, however, ask a series of more meaningful and specific questions. Do the markets react very quickly to new information? Yes, absolutely. Numerous studies show that when news hits, markets react almost instantaneously. The competitiveness of the market evolutionary system ensures this sensitivity... As the power of information and technology has increased, it appears to have made markets more volatile, not less so. The evolutionary explanation is that as information technology improves, it opens up the design space of possible investment strategies and increases arbitrage and technical trading opportunities rather than decreasing them, and thus we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of so-called hedge funds.
>
> Are markets efficient at processing information? The answer again is yes. Markets are brilliant devices for sorting through vast amounts of information from large numbers of people and coming up with an aggregate view of what that information means. There have been experiments using markets to forecast everything from election results to sports scores to Academy Awards results, and the markets often make predictions that are more accurate than either individual experts or simple polling. This informational efficiency is a cornerstone of the efficient-markets hypothesis. However, the theory assumes that markets only use their great forecasting power on information related to a stock’s fundamentals, while in the real world, traders also make bets on what they think other traders are doing and thinking. This more dynamic outlook puts the market in an infinite loop of forming expectations on the expectations of people’s forming expectations of people who are forming expectations, and so on... These expectations of expectations feed the evolutionary dynamics of the market, which means that while the markets are very powerful information processors, they are not efficient in the Traditional Economics sense of the word.
>
> Are investors perfectly rational? No. But are investors self-interested? Yes, financial markets are not charities, and are driven by fear and greed as much as ever. Are investors smart? In general, yes, most money is managed by professionals who range from street-smart traders to PhD rocket scientists. Money managers have all the strengths of human beings, such as superb pattern recognition and creative learning capabilities, as well as all the weaknesses, including irrationalities and biases. Are markets competitive? The answer is, “highly.” Seeing the stressed faces on any trading floor makes that clear. And with the deregulation of global capital flows, markets have only become more so.
>
> Do smart, competitive investors arbitrage profitable opportunities and drive markets to efficiency? The answer is sometimes, but not always. Farmer has pointed out that Traditional theory makes two crucial assumptions about market efficiency. First, in order for arbitrage to work, traders must be able to recognize strategies that make abnormal profits. Second, the amounts of money they put into trading abnormally profitable strategies must be enough to arbitrage the gains away and bring the market back to efficiency. Farmer notes that both of these assumptions are problematic in the real world. The measure of an abnormally profitable strategy is the information ratio (also known as the Sharpe ratio or return-to-risk ratio), which is the expected annual return divided by the expected standard deviation of that return. A strategy with high returns and low risk will thus have a high information ratio, while a low return, high-risk strategy will have a low information ratio. Most traders consider an information ratio of 1 as the sign of an attractive strategy. But as Farmer notes, learning the information ratio of a strategy takes time. If one assumes that returns are normally distributed (a bell curve) then the laws of statistics mean that it would take four years of data to be 95 percent confident that a trader’s strategy had an information ratio of 1 (one can’t rely on historical data alone because of the problem of data mining—one must actually test the strategy going forward). If the returns have fat tails (as data shows they do) then it takes even longer. Thus the rule of thumb, common among traders, that it takes five years of performance to know whether a strategy is any good or not is probably about right. This timescale is further lengthened by the “millionth monkey” problem. If enough traders are trading, then the odds are high that one of them will have a good five year run just by pure luck, further lengthening the time to confidently identify abnormally profitable strategies.
>
> The second assumption has similar difficulties. Traditional theory assumes that infinite amounts of capital are instantaneously available for abnormally profitable strategies. But in the real world, successful traders need to accumulate capital over time. For example, if a trader started with $1 million and earned a 25 percent return (which would be very good) he or she would take thirty years to increase his or her funds under management to $1 billion. If in addition the trader doubled his or her capital every year from outside sources, it would still take ten years. It is possible for successful traders to raise large funds from outside investors much more quickly, but Farmer’s point is that the timescale to establish a track record and then to raise the funds is measured in years. But markets do not stand still during periods of years, and profitable trading strategies can thus come and go on timescales faster than the market can arbitrage them to efficiency.

> Are there magic formulas for getting rich? The answer is no. Samuelson was right when he said that it is hard to get rich in Las Vegas, Churchill Downs, or the local Merrill Lynch office. But he was wrong as to the reasons why. It is not because financial markets follow random walks; rather, it is because you would have a hard time getting rich in any competitive evolutionary environment, whether you are a trader on Wall Street or a tree frog in the Brazilian rain forest. There is an important difference, though, between Wall Street and Vegas. In Vegas, no matter how hard you try and how smart you are, you will never improve your odds (unless you bring a shoe computer). But Wall Street is not a game of pure chance—it is a highly dynamic, constantly evolving, complex system. Inevitably, at any point in time, some people will understand the system better than others and will get rich, at least for a while. Traditional Economics should ask itself, if financial markets are so efficient, then why does Wall Street seem to have a lot more Porsches and Ferraris than Main Street has? But competitive advantage is just as temporary in financial markets as it is in product and services markets. Inevitably, someone else will come along with a better idea, a cleverer strategy, or a more powerful technology and will take his or her moment in the sun.

> The efficient-markets hypothesis is a myth born of nineteenth-century theories of equilibrium and Bachelier’s random walk. Although Traditional market efficiency may not be a very meaningful concept, financial markets are highly effective evolutionary systems. Markets are the best Social Technology devised yet for integrating the views of large numbers of people to put prices on complex assets, and to allocate capital. Furthermore, the competitive intensity of markets ensures that they are fast at processing information, and that there is pressure on their participants to continuously innovate. Andrew Lo of MIT calls this evolutionary effectiveness of markets the “Adaptive Markets Hypothesis.” If there is a magic formula on New York’s Wall Street, London’s City, or the other markets of the world, it is differentiate, select, amplify, and repeat...

> Implications for Managers

> There is, however, another constituency for whom Complexity finance raises several important issues—business executives. Complexity finance affects the world of business in three areas. First, widely used methods for calculating a company’s cost of capital may be wrong. Second, Complexity finance raises questions about the appropriateness of granting stock options in executive compensation. Third, and perhaps most importantly, it challenges us to think in new ways about the fundamental purpose of corporations and the nature of shareholder capitalism. We will discuss each in turn.

> The Cost of Capital...
>
> Do Stock Options Make Sense?
>
> One of the results of the academic finance revolution of the 1970s was to make stock market performance the primary metric by which boards and management teams measure the success or failure of a corporation. This in turn created a movement to link executive compensation with stock market performance through the use of stock options. The motivation and original idea behind this movement made great sense. Public corporations suffer from a built-in principal-agent problem, which pits the principals (shareholders) in a company against the agents (the CEO and his or her management team). On the one hand, shareholders want the company they own to be managed for the maximum value of their shares. On the other hand, the CEO and management team, if left to their own devices, might manage the company to maximize other things, like their salaries, the fancy artwork in the lobby, and the size of the corporate jet. In the 1960s and 1970s, numerous companies became virtual prisoners of their management teams, with CEOs who ran their companies into the ground while maximizing their salaries and egos. The Traditional finance professors did everyone a great service by reminding us that it is the shareholders who own a company and that CEOs and management teams work for those shareholders and not for themselves. A logical way to align the interests of owners and management is to measure the management team on stock price performance and then give them financial incentives to do things that raise the share price. The view was that the best way to do this was to give managers stock options that would tie their future compensation to future stock performance. This idea caught on like wildfire in the 1980s, particularly as a wave of hostile takeovers put boards under pressure to improve their companies’ share price performance. Thus, stock options jumped from 23 percent of the value of the median U.S. CEO’s pay package in 1983, to 45 percent in 1998. It’s a good idea in theory, but from the perspectives of both Complexity finance and actual practice, it is a bit more problematic. The fiduciary duty of management teams to serve shareholder interests is inscribed in law in most countries, and most Complexity economists would not disagree with the importance of the principal-agent issue. They would, however, point out a major problem. CEOs and management teams don’t actually control stock prices. They control things such as strategy, costs, investments, and people, which in turn influence things such as revenue, profits, return on capital, and growth. The levers that CEOs and management teams have under their control affect a company’s ability to create economic value, but only indirectly affect stock price. Traditional economists argued that the practice of tying executive performance to stock price was fine because in an efficient market, the fundamentals that management influences also drive stock price, particularly in the long term. But as we have seen, in the real world, price does not always track value, and the deviations can be significant and last for years. There is, of course, some correlation between price and fundamental value, and the market is not completely insensitive to the actions of a management team, but the correlation is loose at best. In effect, we are judging CEOs on how well they drive a car with a very loose steering wheel. As we have seen, the interplay between investment strategies, trader psychology, market institutional structures, and other factors beyond a management team’s control can sometimes far outweigh fundamental factors in driving share price... Wiring CEO compensation tightly into stock market performance has also inevitably changed CEO behavior. Some of it undoubtedly has been for the better, making CEOs feel more accountable for their company’s performance. But it has also caused many CEOs to obsess over the twitches and ticks of the market and adopt a very short-term perspective toward managing what they think the market wants (usually the next quarter’s earnings) rather than focusing on long-term value creation and building a strong, adaptive organization... I am not claiming that CEOs and management teams have no influence on stock market performance—of course they do. But they are only one of many players in determining share price, and the fundamental signals they generate may often be drowned out by the cacophony of dynamics generated by a complex, evolving market. Nor am I arguing that CEOs should have no link to the performance of their stocks; we certainly don’t want to go back to the bad old days of unaccountable CEOs holding shareholders hostage. But rather than holding CEOs accountable for an uncontrollable share price, we should hold them accountable for what they actually control: fundamental economic performance and long-term value creation. Since the early 1990s, Harvard Business School professor Robert Kaplan and his coauthor, David Norton, have been advocating an approach to measuring corporate performance—an approach they call the balanced scorecard. They note that no single metric, including share price, provides a complete picture of a company’s performance. Instead, Kaplan and Norton recommend that each company analyze the factors that drive value creation in its business model, and custom-build a scorecard of measures around those factors. Such a scorecard should include a mixture of accounting, financial market, and other metrics (e.g., talent and customer metrics) that cover a firm’s growth, profitability, and return on capital, as well as provide both backward-looking and forward-looking perspectives. The overall emphasis should be on the management team’s success in creating economic value over the long term...
>
> What Is the Goal of a Corporation?
>
> ... So the best way managers can serve society is to maximize the profits of their enterprises. The goal of profit maximization, however, creates a problem. How do we know if management is truly maximizing its profits? Is a 10 percent profit good enough? How about 15 percent? What do we compare it to? In the view of Traditional Economics, the best judge of whether management is doing a good job is the capital markets. Self-interested investors will look to put their capital where it will earn the highest return for the risk involved. Since debt capital gets paid a fixed amount of interest, while equity returns swing with company profitability, shareholders are the best judges of whether management is doing a good job. Thus, profit maximization gets operationalized as maximize shareholder value. In addition, many countries spell out legal obligations, or fiduciary duties, that boards and management teams have to serve the economic interests of shareholders. The United States and Great Britain go the farthest in elevating shareholders to a position of primacy. The legal systems of other countries, in particular many continental European countries and Japan, also provide management with fiduciary duties to shareholders, but shareholders are viewed as one of many stakeholders whose interests must be met. Among the stakeholders are employees (usually represented by labor unions), consumers, the communities in which the companies operate, and the government. For example, in Holland, large companies are required to have labor representatives on their boards, and the company’s objective is defined as the continuity of the business rather than maximizing shareholder value. Advocates of shareholder capitalism argue that such stakeholder systems muddy the waters by trying to satisfy competing interest groups, leave management less accountable, and in fact serve overall society less well than shareholder-based systems. As evidence, shareholder advocates point to the high-productivity, high-growth, and high-employment economy that shareholder capitalism has created in the United States. This is not merely an academic issue. Questions over whose interests corporations should serve lie at the heart of heated debates over corporate governance reforms, corporate social-responsibility initiatives, antiglobalization protests, and the future of the European Union’s economic model.

> Endure and Grow
>
> Complexity Economics does not necessarily contradict the Traditional line of argument. Markets are still the most effective mechanism for pricing and allocating resources. Shareholders are still the legal owners of companies. And management must still be held accountable for its performance. But Complexity theory does offer a more nuanced view, raises some important questions, and suggests an alternative, objective function. If we return to the first principles of our evolutionary framework, perhaps we can get some insights into the question of corporate objectives. As we discussed in chapter 9, evolutionary systems have a stark and pristine logic to them—good replicators get replicated. The objective function of any schema must be the survival and replication (or amplification) of its interactor. Any other objective function is a recipe for extinction. Translated into an economic context, this means that the objective of any Business Plan should be the survival and amplification of its business. It is therefore management’s job to devise and execute Business Plans with this objective function. Put into more conventional terms, this means that it is management’s job to devise and execute Plans that enable the businesses of their firm to endure and grow over time. At first glance, an objective function of “enduring and growing” might sound closer to the Dutch objective of continuity than to the U.S. objective of maximizing shareholder value. But further reflection reveals that continuity and the maximization of shareholder value may not be so incompatible after all. All evolutionary systems operate under a set of constraints imposed by the laws of thermodynamics. Survival and replication require flows of entropy-fighting energy, matter, and information. In biological systems, this means that all organisms face a thermodynamic profit constraint whereby calories ingested must, over time, be equal to or greater than calories burned. Good replicators are calorically profitable replicators, and they manage to be profitable in a competitive environment where resources are finite. Likewise, in economic systems, entropy reduction requires flows of energy, matter, and information (which in modern economies are measured in currencies), and all businesses face a profit constraint under which the inflows must be equal to or greater than the outflows. In evolutionary systems, profitability is not an objective in and of itself; rather, it is a fundamental constraint that must be met if a business is to achieve the objective of survival and replication (or enduring and growing). The management thinker Charles Handy illustrates this distinction by noting that eating is a constraint on living (and a very vital one), but no one would claim that the purpose of life is to eat.
>
> But if we unpack the notion of profitability in an economic context, we find yet another set of constraints. To successfully execute a Business Plan, a management team must create an ecosystem of cooperation in and around the organization. First, capital must be attracted to the enterprise and the providers of that capital must see a potential return that is better than their alternative investment opportunities. Second, employees must be attracted and given incentives to work productively. Third, suppliers must see a profitable relationship with the business. And fourth, the business must provide goods and services that people want. But that is not the end of it. Management must also ensure that the business meets its legal obligations, pays its taxes, and does not do anything that causes the general populace to want to shut it down. Profitability is in fact a multidimensional problem in pleasing lots of people. In evolutionary terms, this is the economic fitness function: fit companies do a better job in meeting this multidimensional constraint than unfit ones do. Thus, from an evolutionary perspective, shareholder-ism versus stakeholder-ism is a false dichotomy. The fitness function is what it is—it doesn’t matter whether one calls it shareholder-ism or stakeholder-ism—it is simply what a management team has to do for its business to endure and grow.
>
> Shareholder-ism versus stakeholder-ism is also a false dichotomy in practical terms. Most advocates of shareholder capitalism acknowledge that a company that is unfair to its employees, breaks laws, and treats its customers poorly will be unlikely to provide good long-run returns to its shareholders. And most advocates of a stakeholder system admit that companies must generate a competitive return on capital to keep their investors on board. The key to this practical equivalence between shareholder and stakeholder systems is competitive markets; labor, capital, customers, and suppliers must all be able to go somewhere else.
>
> ... Thus, from both an evolutionary and a practical perspective, paying a competitive return to one’s shareholders is a constraint, not an objective, and while it may be a vitally important constraint, it is nonetheless only one of many constraints in the economic fitness function. This then brings us back to the objective itself. What does the objective “to endure and grow” mean?... One might then ask, “If Traditional Economics and Complexity Economics lead roughly to the same place, albeit by different routes, then what is the difference?” Perhaps the distinction between constraints and objectives is just academic word mincing. The critical difference lies in how management teams apply these concepts. The objective of maximizing shareholder value has been operationalized by many management teams as an obsession with the swings in short-term stock price and quarterly earnings results. A survey of over four hundred chief financial officers conducted for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the majority of companies viewed quarterly earnings as the key metric they should manage in the belief that by managing earnings, the companies would maximize their stock price. Quarterly earnings announcements may indeed move prices, but as we have seen, such news may be far from the only thing moving prices. This fixation on quarterly earnings in turn often distorts management decision making. In the same survey, a majority of the CFOs said that they would forgo value-creating long-term investments if it meant missing analyst earnings estimates, and more than three-quarters said they would sacrifice economic value for a smooth earnings record... Not only would the objectives of endurance and growth help management clarify its raison d’être and better balance its decision making, but the objectives would also help management in communicating its goals to important constituencies, in particular, employees and external interest groups. Few employees jump out of bed in the morning fired up to maximize shareholder value. Most employees don’t have stock options, and they view shareholders as big, rich, anonymous institutions. But employees can attach to the concepts of building a great, lasting institution that creates opportunities for people through growth. Likewise, external constituencies, including politicians and activists, have a difficult time relating to maximizing shareholder value as the purpose of corporations. They see corporations as existing to serve the larger interests of society and, rightly or wrongly, don’t buy the logic that serving shareholders is also serving society. This mind-set has created enormous communications problems in recent debates over corporate social responsibility and public relations headaches for many management teams. Such constituencies would no doubt have an easier time seeing the connection between societal and corporate interests if the expressed goals of management were to build enduring institutions that provide products and services that people want, generate employment, pay taxes, operate within the law, maintain good relationships with external constituencies, and are innovating and growing to provide more of these societal benefits in the future... Arie de Gues, in The Living Company, a book based on a famous Royal Dutch/Shell study of twenty-seven large, long-lived companies, describes how the companies profiled saw their purpose as to “survive and thrive.” In a similar vein, James Collins and Jerry Porras, in Built to Last, studied eighteen long-lived companies and summarize their attitude as “more than profits.” The authors add that for these companies, “profit is like oxygen, food, water, and blood for the body; they are not the point of life, but without them, there is no life.” It is no coincidence that the objectives of enduring and growing echo the imperatives of executing and adapting discussed in the previous chapter. Both stem from the same evolutionary logic. The fact that companies are typically better at executing than adapting undoubtedly has a link to the short-term focus on earnings. Embracing the dual objectives of endurance and growth forces management to fully confront the inherent tensions in executing and adapting and creates pressure to strike a more equal balance between the two. In a competitive evolutionary environment, “endure and grow” is the what, and “adapt and execute” is the how. Enduring and growing are the timeless demands placed on designs in an evolutionary system." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D.

> "CHAPTER EIGHTEEN - Politics and Policy - THE END OF LEFT VERSUS RIGHT
>
> THE WORLD OF economic ideas has always been linked to the world of politics, and historically, paradigm shifts in economic theory have led to reconfigurations of the political landscape. Adam Smith’s ideas helped inspire a dramatic expansion in free trade in the nineteenth century. Karl Marx’s theories provided the impetus for cataclysmic changes in the twentieth century. The Neoclassical paradigm laid the intellectual foundations of Western capitalist orthodoxy, while Keynesianism tempered that orthodoxy with a role for the state. In the period after World War II, state activism in Western economies grew to new heights, until challenged in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, who in turn were inspired by the theories of economists such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek... Complexity Economics is really neither Left nor Right. In fact, the Complexity approach to economics has the potential to make the historical framing of politics obsolete. We will begin with a brief review of the history of the Left-Right framework. I will argue that there are two deeply rooted disagreements at the heart of this historical divide: one is a fundamental difference in how the two sides see human nature, and the other is a difference in views on the role of states versus markets. Complexity Economics offers a new perspective on both of these age-old debates that fits neatly into neither camp. We will then discuss examples of how Complexity Economics can be applied to issues in three areas: poverty in the developing world, the erosion of what researchers call “social capital” in the United States and other developed countries, and economic inequality. We will then close with some thoughts on future directions for Complexity Economics research.
>
> A Framework Past Its Time
>
> The idea of viewing politics on a spectrum from Left to Right has been impressive in its durability, lasting well over two hundred years. The terms originated in the layout of the French National Assembly, created during the Revolution of 1789. The Third Estate revolutionaries sat on the left side of the chamber, while the conservative First Estate royalists sat on the right. From its earliest days, the term Left had connotations of fighting for social progress, defending the less privileged, and remaking society for the better—but the term also had the whiff of utopianism. Likewise, the term Right had connotations of emphasizing individual freedom and responsibility, protecting social stability, and a belief in natural, incremental progress—but also had a subtext of defending the privileged and powerful. The economic dimensions of the Left-Right dichotomy were crystallized during the next century by the theories of Marx and Engels, and the epic battle between socialism and capitalism. By the early twentieth century, the Left had become associated with policies advocating strong government intervention in the economy, ranging from outright ownership of economic assets in communist economies, to partial ownership and a regulatory role in social democracies, while the Right had become the haven of free-market advocates. Although the specific meanings of the terms continued to evolve, the broad dimensions of the divide remained constant through the mid- to late twentieth century: states versus markets, social liberalism versus social conservatism, and the needs of the many versus the rights of the individual. After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and communism collapsed, Johns Hopkins University professor Francis Fukuyama boldly predicted that the great debate had finally been resolved and that the “End of History” had arrived.2 During this period, a number of intellectuals and politicians attempted to reframe the terms of Left versus Right. In 1996 the Democratic Leadership Council in the United States published its New Progressive Declaration, and in 1998, Anthony Giddens (now Lord Giddens), the head of the London School of Economics and an adviser to Tony Blair, published a book titled The Third Way.3 Both the “New Democrats” in the United States and “New Labour” in the United Kingdom, as they came to be called, argued for a position that sought to combine the wealth-generating success of capitalism with the humanitarian objectives of socialism—in essence directing capitalist means to socialist ends. This framing helped propel the economic ideologies of both the Clinton administration and the Blair government, and showed up in policies such as Clinton’s reform of the U.S. welfare system, and Blair’s attempts to inject market forces into the struggling British National Health Service. The idea of capitalism with a friendly face even had appeal to the Right side of the spectrum. George W. Bush’s first election campaign was largely centered around the idea of “compassionate conservatism.” But history had not ended. The mobs on the streets of Seattle protesting the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting showed that the Left-Right divide was certainly alive. Likewise, many of Blair’s reforms ran into rancorous opposition from the Left wing of his own party and stalled out, while Bush’s compassionate conservatism turned out to mean sweeping tax cuts for the wealthy. The divide between Left and Right may have narrowed after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, but it did not go away. To the extent that a third way was developed during the 1990s, it was based more on practical politics than on new economic theories. Both sides had learned the hard way that extreme, or purist, implementations of their models simply do not work. State-run utopias turn into bureaucratic nightmares, and free-market paradises lead to dysfunctional societies. Thus a century that included both Soviet gulags and the Great Depression ultimately forged a broad, pragmatic consensus that markets and states each have roles to play in society. Nonetheless, this centrist consensus left an intellectual vacuum. By the end of the twentieth century there was a feeling that the two poles symbolized by Marx and Smith were both wrong, but there was no new coherent framework to replace them. Despite the aspirations of its progenitors, the third way had evolved into a set of political tactics for winning elections from the center ground, rather than a truly new economic paradigm. It is this intellectual vacuum that Complexity Economics has the potential to fill. The Complexity approach to economics offers not just a muddled middle—it is neither Neoclassicism with a few market failures, nor socialism with a few market mechanisms—but a wholly new perspective. The fundamental question isn’t Left versus Right; it is how best to evolve.
>
> Human Nature and Strong Reciprocity
>
> If one digs deeply into the Left-Right divide, down to its philosophical and historical core, one finds two conflicting views of human nature. On the Left is the view that human beings are inherently altruistic; that greed and selfishness stem not from human nature, but from the construction of the social order; and that humans can be made better through a more just society. The lineage of this view descends from Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl Marx. On the Right is the view that human beings are inherently self-regarding and that the pursuit of self-interest is an inalienable right. The most effective system of government is one that accommodates rather than attempts to change this aspect of human nature. As the eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher David Hume put it, “in contriving any system of government … every man ought to be supposed to be a knave and to have no other end, in all his actions, than his private interests.”5 The Right claims, however, that if people pursue their self-interest through the mechanism of markets, then the general interests of society will be served as well. The lineage of this view descends from Hume, John Locke, and Thomas Hobbes. One might be surprised not to see Adam Smith’s name on this list. But as the economists Herbert Gintis, Samuel Bowles, and Ernst Fehr, and the anthropologist Robert Boyd point out, Smith actually took a more nuanced view. In his Wealth of Nations, Smith indeed showed how self-interest, mediated by markets, can lead to social benefit. But in his other great work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith also said, “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortunes of others.”6 In other words, Smith took a more rounded view of human behavior, one that acknowledged the coexistence of both the self-interested and altruistic sides of human nature. Gintis and his colleagues claim that modern research shows that both the historical Left and Right views of human nature are too simplistic. For centuries, the question of the self-regarding versus the altruistic nature of human-kind was a philosophical question and ultimately a matter of opinion. Since the 1980s, however, it has become a scientific question. A substantial body of evidence from controlled experiments, empirical studies, anthropological field work, and the application of game theory has now yielded an answer: Smith was basically right. Human beings are neither inherently altruistic nor selfish; instead they are what researchers call conditional cooperators and altruistic punishers. Gintis and his colleagues refer to this type of behavior as strong reciprocity and define it as “a predisposition to cooperate with others, and to punish (even at personal cost if necessary) those who violate the norms of cooperation, even when it is implausible to expect these costs will be recovered at a later date.”7 This is the behavior we saw in our earlier discussion of the ultimatum game and the evolving Prisoner’s Dilemma. In essence, people try to follow the Golden Rule, but with a slight twist: do unto others as you would have them do unto you (i.e., conditional cooperation)—but if others don’t do unto you, then nail them, even at personal cost to yourself (i.e., altruistic punishment). People have a highly developed sense of whom they can trust and whom they cannot, to whom they owe favors and who owes favors to them, and whether they are being taken advantage of. As the old adage says, “Fool me once, shame on you: fool me twice, shame on me.” The universality of strong reciprocity behavior is staggering; it has been found in groups of people ranging from modern industrial societies, to remote hunter-gatherer tribes. There is a debate as to how much of this behavior is genetic versus cultural, but there are three pieces of evidence that point strongly to a genetic basis. First is the fact that strong reciprocity shows up in widely varying cultures—no society has been found that does not exhibit some form of it, thus indicating that its origins are not purely cultural.8 Second is the fact that similar behaviors have been observed in a number of primate species.9 And third, a biochemical basis for the behavior has been discovered in oxytocin, a brain hormone that plays a critical role in generating feelings of trust and eliciting cooperation in humans.10 Although strong reciprocity appears to be universal, there is, however, a great diversity of ways in which different societies exhibit and enforce the behavior, thus making it likely that its development has been a case of coevolution between genes and culture. The evolutionary logic for strong reciprocity is simple: in a world of nonzero-sum games, conditional cooperators perform better than agents following either purely selfish or purely altruistic strategies. Even though no single strategy dominated Kristian Lindgren’s evolving Prisoner’s Dilemma model, it is no coincidence that the strategies that rose to the top tended to be variations on the conditional cooperator theme. Likewise, when researchers surveyed results of the ultimatum game played by people around the world, they found that the society that came the closest to behaving according to the self-interested rationality assumed by Traditional Economics was the Machiguenga people of the Peruvian rain forest. The Machiguenga’s cultural norms for strong reciprocity are not as well developed as those of other societies, and as a result, Machiguenga culture is characterized by selfishness, mutual suspicion, and low cooperation. Their society has not advanced beyond family units of organization, and not surprisingly they were among the poorest people of the groups tested. A Traditional economist might argue that strong reciprocity is just another form of self-interest. After all, people cooperate to serve their own ends. Cooperation does indeed pay off in a non-zero-sum world, but there are two crucial distinctions between strong reciprocity and Traditional self-interest. First, Traditional Homo economicus does not care about the process of economic interaction, only whether the outcome maximizes the agent’s self-interest. Experiments show, however, that real people care not only about outcomes, but about whether the process itself was fair. Second, as the ultimatum game shows, people will punish unfair behavior, even at a cost to themselves, and even if they have no hope of recovering that cost in the future. In other words, when people feel as if they’ve really been cheated, they can do some pretty crazy stuff. That is certainly a departure from self-interested rationality. The economic and political ramifications of strong reciprocity may not be immediately obvious, but once we change the core assumptions of human behavior, a lot changes. As an example, consider the issue of public support for the welfare state.12 In the 1930s through the 1960s, U.S. government programs to help the less fortunate generally enjoyed widespread popular support. That support dropped dramatically in the 1970s through the 1990s. The reasons for this drop have been the subject of much debate. Those on the Left argue that the lack of support stems from racism, as those receiving benefits are overwhelmingly minorities, and the rise of the selfish “me” generation during this period—in other words, a lack of altruism. The favored explanation of the Right is that people finally woke up to the ineffectuality of most welfare programs, thought it was a waste of their taxes, and wanted their money back—in other words, self-interest. Using a combination of surveys, experiments, and focus groups, Christina Fong, Bowles, and Gintis found significant evidence that the swing in attitude was really due to neither of these explanations, but to strong reciprocity in action. When the social programs were instituted, those receiving benefits were viewed primarily as people who wanted jobs but who, because of bad luck and the vagaries of the economy, could not get them. Social norms supported the idea that such people deserve help. In more recent times, however, the popular perception has shifted to the idea that people on benefits are lazy, not interested in work, and abusing the generosity of society. Those behaviors violate reciprocity norms, and are seen as warranting the withdrawal of support and even punishment. The authors suggest that social policies should be designed specifically to “mobilize rather than offend reciprocal values.” For example, policies that are consistent with strong reciprocity include providing skills training for those who want to work, giving incentives for the poor to accumulate savings, supporting entrepreneurial activities in deprived areas, and improving educational opportunities for the disadvantaged. Likewise, strong reciprocity norms encourage people to categorize the disadvantaged into the deserving and undeserving. Programs that reflect this distinction tend to enjoy broad support. For example, state programs that provide unemployment insurance tend to be popular because workers pay into them while employed, and then if they have bad luck and are laid off, draw on the benefits. Likewise, Social Security has enjoyed over seventy years of popular bipartisan support largely because it is consistent with reciprocity norms—people cannot help getting old, and those who pay into the system benefit from it. On the other hand, programs that run counter to these norms and benefit “undeserving” people tend to be controversial; for example, welfare programs that give benefits with no reciprocal requirements such as work or training, or rehabilitation programs for drug users whose problems are viewed as a consequence of their own actions. But again, if reciprocal action is required (e.g., welfare recipients must work, or drug users must stay clean) then the programs tend to be popularly supported... Human beings are neither the pure-hearted, altruistic creatures of Rousseau, nor the heartless, selfish creatures of Hume. Smith, the economist and moral philosopher, was ultimately right—humans are both. The Complexity Economics view on strong reciprocity means that the Left can finally turn away from Rousseau’s notion that all social ills are society’s fault, and admit a role for personal responsibility. And, likewise, the Right can turn away from Hume’s notion that society must be constructed assuming the worst of human behavior, and admit a role for our more generous instincts. Complexity Economics has shown, however, that individual agent behavior is only one piece of the puzzle. It is the combination of individual behavior and institutional structures that creates the emergent behavior of the system. This leads us to the next great debate between Left and Right—the role of markets versus states.

> As we saw in part 3, over its history, humankind has only developed two mechanisms for facilitating large-scale economic cooperation between strangers—hierarchies and markets.13 There is an enormous variety of implementations contained within these two categories, but they all boil down to one or the other. Even forms of organization that are more egalitarian, such as communes and cooperatives, contain some form of hierarchical power structure.14 The key distinction between a capitalist and a socialist economy from a Complexity Economics perspective is whether the ultimate arbiter of economic fitness is a market or a hierarchy. In both capitalist and socialist systems, a process of Business Plan differentiation, selection, and amplification occurs within hierarchies. In capitalist economies, the process occurs in private-sector firms—this is Alfred Chandler’s “visible hand” at work—while in socialist economies, it occurs in organizations controlled directly or indirectly by the state. In capitalist economies, however, the evolutionary process eventually filters up into the “thin layer” of the market—that is, the layer where Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” provides the final word on Business Plan selection and amplification. In socialist economies, the thin layer of the market does not exist (or is dominated by the state), and the key evolutionary decisions on Business Plan selection and amplification are made within the hierarchies of government organizations.

> The Critique of the Left
>
> The Complexity Economics critique of a pure socialist economy is fairly straightforward and should not be a surprise at this point: the economy is simply too complex for the central planning required by socialism to work effectively. The argument has three key elements, two of which were developed by the great Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek in the 1930s and 1940s. The first is what Hayek called the “knowledge coordination problem.”16 The knowledge required to solve the problem of what to produce in an economy lies scattered all over society. It includes information on preferences embedded in people’s heads, as well as information on costs, technologies, and so on. Collecting this information without market mechanisms is both a practical and a theoretical impossibility. By the time we surveyed the entire population on their preferences for the 1010 SKUs of goods and services in the economy (ignoring the fact that no one could complete such a survey in his or her lifetime), the information would be out of date as soon as it was collected. The same problem holds true with cost data. This leads to the second problem, what Hayek called the “fatal conceit” of socialism.17 If perfect rationality is a critical flaw in Neoclassical theory, it is just as big a problem for socialist theory. In fact, in a controversial article in 1933, the British economist H. D. Dickenson argued that there really was no difference between socialism and capitalism, because Walras’s equations for market equilibrium could simply be solved by a socialist planner and get the same optimal result as a market.18 Hayek countered that even if we were somehow able to collect all the data needed to do this, we would not be able to process it. Consistent with our earlier discussions, Hayek argued that human deductive rationality is simply not up to the job of understanding, predicting, and planning in a system as nonlinear and dynamic as the economy. In essence, Hayek was saying that perfect rationality is just as unrealistic in socialist theory as it is in Neoclassical theory. The third critique builds from Hayek’s two points and is a factor we discussed earlier. If we reject perfect rationality and instead rely on deductive-tinkering, then we need something to judge the success of our tinkering against; we need feedback on what are good Business Plans versus bad Business Plans. Without market mechanisms to provide that feedback, we are stuck with Hayek’s knowledge coordination problem. In the absence of actual knowledge of what society wants, and with no mechanism for enforcing a selection of those things, the Big Man hierarchy of the state will simply produce whatever it decides to produce. As we discussed earlier, the natural tendency of Big Man power hierarchies is to do things that serve the interests of the Big Men. Thus, the fitness function in pure planned economies inevitably reflects the interests of the power hierarchies, and not those of society more broadly. Thus, from a Complexity Economics perspective, markets play a critical role in collecting and processing information, as well as keeping power hierarchies in check by providing a fitness function for Business Plan selection. The vision of a neatly planned utopia does not square well with the messy reality of a complex adaptive system.

> The Critique of the Right
>
> The Complexity critique of the other side of the ideological divide is not so much a critique of capitalism itself, but rather a critique of the Neoclassically inspired Right-wing fantasy of how capitalism works. The argument has two key points. First, while Complexity Economics views markets as both useful and necessary, it also knocks them off their optimally efficient pedestal. As we saw earlier, even financial markets, which are as close to textbook markets as one gets, operate far from their theoretical efficiency. This means that the tendency of some on the Right to automatically assume that markets are the answer to all problems in society is misguided. To be fair, most Traditional economists recognize the fallibility of the markets to some degree, and the literature is full of analyses of market failures. But the Complexity view would take us beyond Traditional market failures and would have us be skeptical of market solutions that depend on Traditional theory’s usual array of unrealistic assumptions.

> A small, but classic example was the deregulation of telephone directory enquiries in the United Kingdom. For fifty years, the United Kingdom had a single national number that one could call to find out a phone number. This monopoly was run by the formerly state-owned British Telecom (BT), and both the price and quality of the service were monitored and regulated by the government. The service was simple, worked well, and netted relatively few consumer complaints. In 2001, however, the government decided to deregulate the service and open it up to competition. The theory was that market competition would lead to lower prices and more innovative services. As predicted, a host of new companies entered; by 2004 there were 120 companies in the market. Theory and reality, however, quickly parted. Under the old system, there was only one number—“192”—and everyone remembered it. In the new system, with 120 competing numbers, few people could remember more than a handful of the new numbers. The new numbers were assigned by lottery, and the companies with the luck to get memorable numbers such as “118 118” quickly became new natural monopolies and captured the bulk of the traffic. In addition, for most people, directory calls are a very small expenditure and not worth the time and effort to seek out the lowest-priced provider. The result was that the new memorable numbers had higher prices and more service complaints than the old BT number. Furthermore, the new numbers were not truly national, as the regulations allowed telephone companies to restrict which numbers could be accessed from their networks—thus one might have to remember different numbers when calling from home, work, or a mobile. The realities of human cognition and the institutional design of the system were at odds with the simple world of Traditional theory, and thus the benefits of market competition did not materialize. Similar examples include the deregulation of the California electricity market, which led to serious electricity shortages in 2001, and the privatization of the British rail network, which has resulted in massively delayed train journeys ever since. None of this is to say that markets are bad and monopolies are good—again, Complexity Economics broadly supports the notion that markets are the best mechanism for economic evolution. Rather the point is that the Right has a tendency to view markets as the solution to all ills, based on the overly simplistic theories of Traditional economics. In each of these cases, the messy details of real human rationality and institutions did not match the theory, and the market solutions failed to deliver the social goods.
>
> The second criticism is that the antigovernment stance of many on the Right looks very naive in the context of Complexity Economics. Neoclassical theory creates an ideal of economies existing in a pristine state of nature, free from the meddling of governments. It is in this idealized state that Pareto optimality is achieved and the maximum wealth for society is created. As soon as one starts interfering by layering on things such as taxes and regulations, one moves away from this ideal, and the amount of wealth created for society is reduced. Thus, the objective should be to restrain taxation and government expenditures to an absolute minimum. Likewise, the Right argues, while some basic regulation might be necessary for ensuring the functioning of markets, regulations generally have a distorting effect, interfere with natural price signals, and, like taxes, push the economy away from its ideal state. In an address to the White House Conference on Small Business in 1986, Ronald Reagan famously said, “Government’s view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.” But the antigovernment free marketers forget that economies don’t exist in isolation. The economic evolutionary system is constructed out of a vast array of Social Technologies, many of which rely on government.20 Market-based evolution requires a careful balance between cooperation and competition, and governments play a vital role in enabling their societies to strike this balance. Social Technologies such as contract law, consumer protection regulations, worker safety rules, and securities law all serve to engender cooperation and trust, while antitrust regulations serve to maintain healthy levels of competition. Those on the Right in the United States often blame Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, for beginning the growth of government “interference” in the economy with the New Deal. But the key architect in positioning the government as a balancer of cooperation and competition was in fact a Republican and a different Roosevelt—Teddy.21 His reforms during 1901 to 1909 in areas ranging from busting up the Rockefeller and Morgan trusts, to enacting the first food safety regulations, provided a critical institutional foundation for economic growth in the twentieth century. One merely has to travel to developing countries with weak government institutions to see what life is like without these interventions. An economy can end up in a low-cooperation, low-competition dead end when government fails to play this role. Certainly, not all government regulations are good—there can, of course, be foolish, wasteful regulations. Nevertheless, the “government is the problem, not the solution” rhetoric of the Right undermines the essential role government institutions play in supporting the evolutionary effectiveness of the economic system.

> Government as Fitness Function Shaper
>
> Just as Complexity Economics provides a new perspective on the economic role of corporations, it also provides a new perspective on the economic role of governments. The Neoclassically inspired position of the Right has been that Pareto optimality is the most morally sound outcome for a free society, and as markets are the best institutional mechanism (in fact the only mechanism) for achieving Pareto optimality, the morally correct role of government is to ensure market efficiency. Any government actions that interfere with the market should be measured in cost-benefit terms against the losses in efficiency. Thus, for example, the Right often uses market efficiency arguments to oppose environmental regulations. In contrast, a Complexity perspective would distinguish between two types of government action. Policies that get the government involved in differentiating, selecting, and amplifying Business Plans would be seen as interfering in economic evolution and have all of the problems discussed in the critique of socialist economies. Examples would include Japanese industrial policy that subsidizes and protects favored industries, French intervention in European banking mergers to favor its own national banks, or the U.S. government’s energy policy favoring corn-based ethanol due to the political importance of Iowa. In contrast, policies that shape the fitness environment, while leaving Business Plan selection and amplification to market mechanisms, are a different matter. As we have seen, notions of efficiency in evolutionary systems are ephemeral. A Complexity perspective would say that government regulations form part of the fitness environment that companies compete in. As long as markets provide the mechanism for selecting and amplifying Business Plans, then the economic evolutionary process will innovate and adapt in response to those regulations. For example, if voters tell their elected representatives that protecting the environment is a priority for society, then it is well within the government’s purview to shape the economic fitness function to favor environmentally friendly Business Plans over environmentally unfriendly plans. Examples would include a carbon tax, emissions trading, or mandatory industry recycling requirements. In these cases the government is not selecting plans (e.g., whether fuel cells, ethanol, wind power, or some other Physical Technology is the best way to reduce emissions), but rather shaping the fitness environment in which plans will succeed or fail (e.g., in a world with a carbon tax a low-emissions plan will do better than a high-emissions plan). This view of government as a fitness function shaper sits uneasily with both the Right and the Left. The Right is squeamish about the efficiency costs. But, as we have seen, the efficiency cost argument is inherently static—for example, if a carbon tax spurred innovations that dramatically lowered the cost of solar power, would that make the economy more or less efficient? The Left on the other hand tends to trust the rationality of bureaucrats more than the creative power of markets, and to prefer a more directive approach (e.g., preferring mandatory reduction targets for all power plants rather than emissions trading). One might argue, however, that if both the Right and the Left object, then it probably means we are on the right track. The idea of government as a fitness function shaper, however, should be approached with caution for all of the reasons Hayek pointed out. We should be realistic about our ability to predict the effects of government shaping of the fitness function and the likelihood of unintended consequences. This does not mean that government cannot productively play such a role, but rather it means that there needs to be a willingness to experiment, collect feedback, and change course, none of which is ever politically easy. It also changes the terms of the debate from stale, ideological battles over market efficiency versus social goals, to practical discussions of how the evolutionary processes of the market can be better shaped to serve society’s needs.

> Complexity Economics thus changes our perspective not just on the ideological positions of Left and Right, but also on the two great institutions that they battle over: states and markets. The economic role of the state is to create an institutional framework that supports the evolutionary workings of markets, strikes an effective balance between cooperation and competition, and shapes the economic fitness function to best serve the needs of society. Consistent with norms of strong reciprocity, the state also has an obligation to ensure that all its citizens have an equal opportunity to participate in the economic system, and to provide a basic level of support for those who do not succeed in that system. The economic role of markets is to provide incentives for the discovery and differentiation of Business Plans, apply the fitness function shaped by consumers, technology, and the state in selection, and channel resources to selected plans for amplification. The question is not states versus markets—it is how to combine states and markets to create an effective evolutionary system...

> “Culture Matters”
>
> ... As the economic historian David Landes has put it, “This world is roughly divided into three kinds of nations: those that spend lots of money to keep their weight down; those whose people eat to live; and those whose people don’t know where their next meal is coming from.” The candidates for the causes of this divide have historically fallen into Left and Right camps.25 On the Left, favorite explanations include colonialism, racism, capitalist exploitation, and insufficient aid from rich countries. Meanwhile, the arguments on the Right have gravitated toward bad government, corruption, a lack of free markets, dependency on foreign aid, and even, subtly (and sometimes not so subtly), racial inferiority. In addition, a few less politically charged explanations have been put forward that include geography, climate, and particularly in Africa’s case, the tragedy of near-constant warfare. In 1999, Harvard international studies professor Lawrence Harrison and his Harvard colleague Samuel Huntington (who famously predicted a clash of civilizations after the end of the Cold War) convened a symposium entitled “Cultural Values and Human Progress.” The symposium tied together work that researchers around the world had been conducting for decades on the role of culture in economic development. The conference included well-known Western economists, historians, and social thinkers such as David Landes, Michael Porter, Jeffrey Sachs, Francis Fukuyama, and Nathan Glazer. But the conference didn’t just include Western scholars abstractly discussing faraway cultures; it also included a number of researchers and social commentators from the countries under discussion, as well as practitioners from aid agencies. One of the outputs of the conference was a book, Culture Matters, whose title sums up the group’s conclusion. In chapter 16, we defined culture as the emergent product of the micro rules of behavior followed by individuals, and discussed its role in the economic performance of organizations. Perhaps not surprisingly, the participants at the Harvard conference contended that culture plays a large role in the economic performance of nations too. In the case of nations, the rules or norms of behavior aren’t merely acted out by thousands, but are acted out by millions. Observations on the connection between culture and macroeconomic performance go back at least to the turn of the last century and the writings of the German sociologist Max Weber. But in the 1950s and 1960s, cultural explanations for economic outcomes fell out of favor for two reasons. The first was political correctness. As Landes put it, “culture … frightens scholars. It has a sulfuric odor of race and inheritance, an air of immutability.”28 The second reason was the dominance of Neoclassical economics. Culture has little place in a world of perfect rationality, and to the extent that it does, cultural rules must be self-interested, optimizing strategies, because otherwise, people would not use them. Fortunately, fears over political correctness have faded as scholars have shown that it is possible to have discussions about culture that are both scientifically fruitful, and respectful of the diversity of humankind. One must avoid the relativist trap and not shy away from statements about why the norms of one culture might be more supportive of economic development than those of another, but at the same time, one can recognize that there is no one cultural formula for economic success. In a world in which cultures as varied as Japan’s and Norway’s are among the most economically successful, such claims of one perfect formula are easily dismissed. Likewise, the rise of behavioral economics has reduced the influence of Neoclassical assumptions and brought the cultural horse inside the economic stable. The multibillion-dollar question then is, which norms support economic development, and which norms don’t? Much research remains to be done in this area, but various researchers, such as the Argentinean scholar Mariano Grondona, have proposed typologies of cultural rules.30 The rules in these typologies fall roughly into the same three broad categories as did the organizational rules I presented in chapter 16. This should not be surprising, as both organizational and societal norms need to support the processes of economic evolution if they are to support wealth creation.
>
> In the first category are norms related to individual behavior. These include norms that support a strong work ethic, individual accountability, and a belief that you are the protagonist of your own life and not at the whim of gods or Big Men. Fatalism greatly reduces personal incentives. It is also important to believe that there is a payoff to hard work and a moral life in this world, and not just in the next. Finally, economically successful cultures appear to strike a balance between optimism that improvement is possible, and realism about one’s current situation. In the second category are norms related to cooperative behavior. Foremost is a belief that life is a non-zero-sum game and that there are payoffs to cooperation. Societies that believe in a fixed pie of wealth have a difficult time engendering cooperation and tend to be low in mutual trust. Consistent with our discussion of strong reciprocity, it is important that the culture have norms that value generosity and fairness, but also sanction those who free ride and cheat. The third category contains norms related to innovation.31 Deductive-tinkering is much more effective if the deductive part is strong, and thus cultures that look to rational scientific explanations of the world rather than religious or magical explanations tend to be more innovative. Likewise, a culture needs to be tolerant of heresy and experimentation, as strict orthodoxy stifles innovation. Finally, it is important that the culture be supportive of competition and celebrate achievement, since overly egalitarian cultures reduce the incentives for risk taking. One final norm is important to all three categories: how people view time. Cultures that live for today (or, conversely, are mired in the past) have problems across the board, ranging from low work ethic, to an inability to engage in complex cooperation and low levels of investment in innovation. Why work hard, and invest in cooperation and innovation if tomorrow doesn’t matter? In contrast, cultures that have an ethic of investing for tomorrow tend to value work, have high intergenerational savings rates, demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice short-term pleasures for long-term gain, and enjoy high levels of cooperation. Just like organizations, societies with hardworking, cooperative, innovative cultures would clearly facilitate the discovery, execution, and continued evolution of complex Business Plans. Likewise, serious deficiencies in any of these areas could potentially slow down or stop the wheels of economic evolution.
>
> Again, there is no single way to implement these general types of norms. Japanese methods for encouraging stable cooperation may be quite different from Norwegian approaches, and no culture is equally strong across all areas. Moreover, rendering judgments on these norms does not necessarily imply moral judgments. Some of the norms have both economic and moral implications. For example, sanctions against cheating have economic as well as moral benefits. But many norms do not. For example, a live-for-today society might be just as moral as an invest-for-tomorrow society—just not as rich. Finally, while our focus is on economic success, it is not the only measure of societal health. For example, a society might have strong norms of tolerance and forgiveness that allow cheating to proliferate, thus weakening its ability to create large-scale, stable cooperation and reducing its economic achievements. But the very same norms might make it a warm, friendly, and even peaceful society. Keeping these caveats in mind, one can begin to analyze the cultures of individual societies and assess the economic efficacy of their norms. One of the participants in the Harvard conference, Daniel Etounga-Mangeulle, an African business executive, noted that despite the diversity of African cultures, there is a “foundation of shared values, attitudes, and institutions that binds together the nations south of the Sahara.”32 He argued that too many of these common norms are on the wrong side of the cultural typology, and he highlighted two factors in African culture that he believes have particularly negative economic impacts: excessive concentrations of authority in individual Big Men (who often claim magical powers), and a view of time that focuses on the past and present, but not the future: “Without a dynamic perception of the future, there is no planning, no foresight, no scenario building, no policy to effect the course of events.” The impact of these norms is not just additive and linear over the population. As agents follow cultural norms they interact, and create complex dynamics. For example, let’s examine the interplay between those who believe the world is a zero-sum game and those who see it as a non-zero-sum game. If your beliefs are biased toward seeing the world as a zero-sum game, then your objective will be to get your slice of the pie. You will view someone else’s gain as your loss, and your proclivity to cooperate will be low. Rather than searching for new, more complex, and wealth-creating cooperative activities, people will invest their energies in finding ways to capture a greater share of existing wealth. It is not hard to imagine that thievery, dishonesty, and corruption will be higher in such a zero-sum society. The moral attitudes around such activities will also be different; for example, theft might be viewed as “I’m just taking my fair share” from someone who has more than his or her rightful share. Now, imagine a population in which some agents think the economic pie is fixed, while others have a non-zero-sum view. Over time, as the non-zero-sum agents find ways to cooperate and create new wealth, they will be attacked by zero-sum agents trying to get their share. This conflict will lower the returns to cooperation, and eventually, the non-zero-sum agents will learn that cooperation doesn’t pay and become zero-sum agents themselves. Non-zero-sum attitudes don’t need to be an inherited, hardwired trait. One could have two populations in which people are born with the same natural distribution of attitudes and predispositions. But in the low-cooperation society, non-zero-sum attitudes are essentially beaten out of the agents over time and they eventually learn to become zero-sum agents. When researchers model these dynamics, they often find there is a tipping point: once a society is past a threshold ratio of noncooperators versus cooperators in a population, it becomes very hard to maintain large-scale cooperation, resulting in a “poverty trap.”33 Such tipping points mean that the vagaries of history can send one society down the low cooperation path into a poverty trap, while another society with the same predispositions to cooperate might bootstrap its way to riches. The dynamic interplay between cooperators and defectors can thus influence the evolution of norms and the level of trust in a society. Culture is not an immutable force; rather, it coevolves as people in a society interact with each other—culture is a product of history, and history is a product of culture. Numerous studies have shown that levels of trust vary widely across cultures.35 In 1996, a major survey was conducted across a number of countries asking people (in their native language), “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you cannot be too careful in dealing with people?”36 The diversity of responses was striking, ranging from the most trusting countries, where 65 percent of Norwegians and 60 percent of Swedes agreed they could trust people, down to a mere 5 percent of Peruvians and 3 percent of Brazilians. There is an important correlation between trust and economic success (figure 18-1). High trust leads to economic cooperation, which leads to prosperity, which further enhances trust in a virtuous circle. But the circle can be vicious as well, with low trust leading to low cooperation, leading to poverty, and further eroding trust. The causal relationship is not perfect, however, because trust is not the only factor that determines levels of cooperation. For example, both Chinese and Indians rate themselves higher on trust than do Americans. One explanation is that while trust in the United States is low, Americans have been able to succeed economically despite this because of their strong Social Technologies, in particular, a tradition of respect for the rule of law. Another more gloomy explanation is that Americans are living off the social capital of their past, and unless it is rebuilt, trust will continue to erode. The idea that this erosion of trust will eventually catch up with the United States economically is a topic we will examine in the next section. Francis Fukuyama has investigated why certain cultures have evolved high levels of social trust while others seem trapped in low-trust regimes. One of his conclusions is somewhat paradoxical: that societies with strong “family values” may have a difficult time evolving broader forms of social trust.37 He argues that family-centric cultures, while having deep bonds of trust within families, tend to have narrower radii of trust outside families. In these cultures, economic networks are usually based on kin relationships, which naturally limit the scale to which the networks can grow. As examples, he cites the large proportion of small-scale, family-owned businesses in China, Korea, and Italy, and only a small number of global enterprises relative to the size of their economies. Meanwhile, societies with weaker family traditions, such as Japan, Germany, and Holland, evolved STs to help secure trust outside the bounds of family. These STs ranged from the early establishment of the rule of law, to voluntary and social organizations. Thus, while the bonds of trust within families may be weaker in relation to other cultures, the radius of trust is wider. It is remarkable, for example, that a country as small as Holland has evolved some of the largest corporations in the world, including Royal Dutch/Shell, Philips, and ABN Amro. Karla Hoff of the World Bank and Arijit Sen of the Indian Statistical Institute also believe that overly strong family ties can have a negative impact on development.38 In northern European Protestant traditions, families tend to be defined as the immediate nuclear family of parents and children, with weaker ties to grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In many African and South Asian traditions, the radius of family is larger and stronger, extending to grandparents, aunts, uncles, great aunts, great uncles, cousins, second cousins, and so on. These extended-family societies also have very strong norms on the sharing of economic wealth among family members. Richer family members are expected to help poorer family members. While the warm and fuzzy image of a large, extended family sharing with each other sounds very appealing and may have psychological and other benefits, in economic terms, it creates a basic problem. If you get a job, work hard, and accumulate a bit of savings, you will be rewarded by having your no-good, lazy second cousin come live with you, eat your food, and generally sponge off your hard-earned wages. This is what economists call a moral hazard. Extended definitions of family create incentives for free riding and lower the returns to work and savings. Hoff and Sen argue that not only does the extended family create problems at the individual level, but it can also further retard development as it extends into nepotism in business and government institutions. The implications of culture for development policy are just beginning to be explored, but it is becoming clear that culture must be a part of the development equation. The World Bank economist William Easterly points out that between 1950 and 1995, the developed world provided more than $1 trillion in economic assistance to the developing world, yet the poverty rates in the vast majority of recipient countries barely budged, and many African countries have even slid backward since their independence in the 1960s.39 While aid to alleviate severe and immediate symptoms of poverty remains critical, it is essential that people do more to understand and address the root causes. Although culture is certainly not the only root cause, programs that continue to ignore the cultural basis of poverty are undoubtedly doomed to failure.

> Social Capital and the “Great Disruption”
>
> In 2000, Robert Putnam, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, published Bowling Alone, a book that brought the term social capital into the public consciousness, and stimulated interest in the topic among both economists and policy makers.40 Putnam defines social capital as the “connections among individuals—social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them.”41 In the terminology of Complexity Economics, if cultural norms provide the micro rules of agent behavior, then social capital is the emergent result of agents creating cooperative networks. Not all cooperative activity, however, creates social capital. For example, the anonymous cooperation of trading in markets does not create social capital. A critical attribute of networks with social capital is that the people in them have repeated personal interactions—creating social capital is a contact sport. Typical examples of networks with social capital include local neighborhood associations, charities, religious organizations, sports teams, social clubs, civic groups, hobbyist organizations, and, of course, bowling leagues. Companies and other places of work are also significant sources of social capital, as many people spend the majority of their waking hours at work and build significant personal networks with their colleagues. Putnam notes that while social capital is a friendly-sounding term, it is not always a good thing. Organized crime mobs and terrorist organizations can also have high degrees of trust between individuals, very effective networks, and strong (often brutally enforced) norms of behavior.42 Lest someone be an FBI or a CIA informer, these violent groups’ bonds of trust tend to be limited to close kin, members of their own religious or ethnic group, and other known associates, which, fortunately, puts a natural limit on their growth. Since the 1970s, Putnam has been investigating the link between social capital and economic performance. As a part of this research, he has looked deeply into the significant differences in economic success between wealthy northern Italy and the poor south... From Puglia to Emilia-Romagna, it is a mere four hundred miles, or a six-hour drive. Both are populated by Italians, both have shared Italy’s history; how can they be so utterly different in the effectiveness of their local governments? Putnam locates the source of the dramatic difference between Italy’s regions in a now familiar topic: low trust leading to an inability to achieve large-scale cooperation. Putnam argues that the differences in trust levels stem from the differing histories of the two regions, tracing back to medieval times. This history has resulted in two very different social capital inheritances. The south historically was monarchist, hierarchical, closed, and dominated by the church. Such hierarchical structures viewed civic organizations and business networks as threats to their power and discouraged them. Meanwhile the north was more egalitarian, communal, and open to trade, and later was influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment. In such an environment, social networks grew and flourished.45 As Putnam notes, history is path dependent, and the communal republics of the north gradually built their stock of social capital over centuries, while the monarchist republics of the south never managed to get the virtuous cycle of social capital development going. Over the long run, this dichotomy has translated into very different economic outcomes, with the north of Italy containing some of the richest and fastest-growing regions in the European Union, and the south containing some of the poorest. In Bowling Alone, Putnam turned his sights on the United States to examine the question “What is the state of social capital in America?” The answer was “not good.” He opens his book by describing the disappearance of half-century-old bridge clubs in Pennsylvania, the collapse of a century-old chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Virginia, and of Veterans of Foreign War posts, charity leagues, sewing circles, and marching bands across the land.46 The anecdotal evidence is also supported by statistics. Trust in the U.S. government has fallen by half, from its peak of 40 percent in 1966 to 20 percent in 2003 (excepting a post-9/11 spike). Likewise, trust in business is down from 55 percent to 16 percent, and trust in religious institutions has fallen almost in half to 23 percent.47 Perhaps even more alarming, trust between individuals has also steadily declined. The percentage of Americans agreeing with the statement “most people can be trusted” dropped from over 50 percent in 1968 to just above 30 percent in 2003. The significance of this decline in trust goes beyond the observation that it is more pleasant to live in a trusting society. As we saw earlier, there is evidence of an important connection between societal trust and macroeconomic performance. Putnam’s work is complemented by Francis Fukuyama, who further observes that several indicators of declining social capital began to move simultaneously in the 1960s, including a sevenfold increase in the violent crime rate from 1963 to 1993 (with some drop-off in more recent years) and equally enormous jumps in divorce rates and births to single mothers during the same period.48 Fukuyama calls the period from 1960 to 2000 the “Great Disruption” and notes that the decline in social capital has not been unique to the United States, but has also happened (though to lesser degrees) in much of the rest of the developed world. Both Fukuyama and Putnam agree that the causes are complex and not attributable to a single factor. Both also note that many of the causal factors have been a double-edged sword; on their own, the factors had positive benefits to people, but the emergent effect on society has been negative. For example, both Fukuyama and Putnam cite the dramatic changes to family structure that occurred during this period, in particular, rising divorce rates and the entry of women into the workplace. Easier access to divorce has undoubtedly freed millions from unhappy marriages, but it has also had undeniable effects on children, their socialization, and their own bonds of trust. Likewise, the opening of the workplace to women has had a momentous impact on enabling women to fulfill their individual potential. However, as Putnam notes, women have historically played a larger role in creating the social fabric of society than men have played. Women have usually been more involved in civic organizations, grassroots politics, and religious organizations. They have also historically tended to manage family social networks of friends and neighbors. Putnam cites a study showing that among women of equal age, socioeconomic, and marital status, being in the workforce cuts volunteering by 50 percent, informal visiting with friends 25 percent, club and church attendance by 15 percent, and entertaining by 10 percent.49 Putnam does not criticize women for choosing to work outside the home; at an individual level, it may be both economically necessary and personally fulfilling. Rather, he merely notes that this micro-level change, replicated across millions of women during a relatively short time, has had an important macro-level effect. Another important factor is the change in the physical layout of society, in particular, suburban sprawl. This has affected trust and the building of networks in multiple ways. First, there is simply more space between neighbors and fewer random chances to encounter each other and talk. Second, rather than walking in neighborhoods, people drive, which again means fewer chances to meet the neighbors and more time spent alone in the car. Also, the greater geographical separation of work and home and longer commutes has resulted in a drop-off in workplace socializing (“I’d love to meet after work, but I’ve got an hour commute to get home to my family”). The 1950s Ozzie-and-Harriet image of coworkers living down the road from each other and dropping by for an after-work martini is much less common today. Another factor of immense consequence has been the isolating effect of mass media. Entertainment has dramatically shifted from a group activity of dance halls, concerts, pubs, bridge clubs, bowling leagues, and so on, to an individual activity. Radios, televisions, stereos, video games, home theaters, and the Internet have meant that an increasing portion of nonwork time is spent home alone or just with family. Just as important as the medium itself has been the message. The economics of the media industry drive participants to aim content at mass audiences, and thus programming tends to reflect the lowest common denominators of human emotion (some would argue that this is changing with the more tailored content of the Internet, but given the popularity of porn and gambling on the Web, this is questionable). For more than four decades, society has been fed a diet of murder and mayhem, not just in fiction programming, but in the news media as well. Humans have always loved stories of sex and violence, but the ability to call them up at the touch of a remote control or computer mouse, and vividly presented in television, movies, and computer games, is a new phenomenon in the context of human history. In chapter 6, we discussed the bias in human decision making known as “representativeness,” referring to our limited skills in statistical reasoning and our tendency to misjudge probabilities based on unrepresentative samples. If one is exposed to a steady stream of murder stories, one will subconsciously infer that murder is a pretty common thing and overestimate one’s own chances of being murdered. This kind of fear engendered by the media further reduces trust and isolates people. Just as with the case of women entering the workforce, people have chosen to live in suburbs, drive their cars, and watch television for perfectly valid reasons. Yet again, the macro-emergent effects of these individual choices have been an unexpected and worrying decline in social capital. The effects of this decline on long-term U.S. economic performance are as yet unknown, but they are not likely to be positive. Given the structural and largely irreversible nature of the causes of the Great Disruption (e.g., few would advocate women returning to the home, and people won’t give up their cars), the question of what can be done is difficult. Putnam advocates an “agenda for social capitalists” that includes the following components: • Greater individual commitment to social involvement (and watching less TV), • Programs in schools to help build norms of trust and social capital in the next generation, • Reforms to make workplaces more family friendly, • Better public transport and the rewriting of zoning laws, • Efforts to encourage voting and political involvement. Putnam admits that the challenge of such a multidimensional effort to rebuild American social capital is overwhelming, and our political institutions may not be up to the job of leading such a change. Fukuyama is ultimately more optimistic. He argues that this is neither the first, nor surely the last Great Disruption that humankind has faced.51 Taking an evolutionary view, he notes that human social systems are remarkably adaptive. He observes that past periods of social disruption saw multidecade declines in social capital, followed by a process of “re-norming” and then rebuilding of social capital. For example, Fukuyama cites the immense disruption caused by the shift from an agricultural-based economy to an industrial-based one in the early nineteenth century, and the rises in petty crime, violence, alcoholism, out-of-wedlock birth, and other signs of social stress that accompanied it. He notes that a new social order and set of norms emerged in response to these changes during the Victorian period—a period generally regarded as quite high in social capital.

> The issues around social capital and trust go beyond economics and touch virtually all facets of society.52 The issues speak to a complex adaptive system in flux. Social capital does not get picked up on the radar screen of Traditional Economics, because the Traditional framework is concerned with the self-interested choices of rational individuals, and as long as everyone is choosing optimally for himself or herself, then everyone is choosing optimally for society. Complexity Economics takes a different perspective and allows that the complex interactions of a society mean that well-intentioned individual choices may sometimes yield surprising and not-always-desirable emergent outcomes. In this case, individual choices on factors as varied and seemingly disconnected as where to live, whether to work outside the home, or how to spend one’s leisure time can lead to a dramatic decline in social cohesion. While I agree with Fukuyama’s evolutionary perspective and believe that we will find ways to adapt, evolutionary theory offers no guarantee of a oneway ticket toward greater social order and wealth. Evolutionary systems can experience collapse, dead ends, and poverty traps.53 Thus, I agree with Putnam that a more proactive approach must be taken—an approach that spans individual behavior, schools, governments, civic institutions, and the media. The issues around social capital are not easy to pigeonhole in the traditional Left-Right framework. On the one hand, the overarching point that cooperation lies at the core of economic prosperity is more resonant with the Left and cuts against the grain of the rugged individualism of the Right. Furthermore, those on the Left would argue that the decline in social capital presents a problem that has evolved within market economies across the Western world, and that markets alone will not solve. But on the other side of the political divide, those concerned by the decline in social capital tend to favor a return to old-fashioned values—trust in your neighbor, volunteerism, civic duty, religious involvement, and strong families—these have long been staples of the conservative Right. The argument does not lead us to a mushy position in the center with a bit of community and a bit of old-fashioned values, but rather pulls us hard in both directions simultaneously—a lot of community, a lot of old-fashioned values, and a critical role for government leadership.

> Inequality, Social Mobility, and the Culture of Poverty
>
> We have seen the relationships between poverty, culture, and social capital. We will add a further related issue to the list: inequality. As mentioned earlier, 21 percent of the world’s population lives on less than $1 a day, which translates into well over a billion people. Furthermore, despite progress made by countries such as China and India, many economists would argue that worldwide inequality is growing...
>
> Is Inequality Moral?
>
> While inequality is persistent and pervasive, one can nonetheless ask, is it moral? The political commentator Matt Miller argues in his Two Percent Solution that how one answers that question is a key distinguishing feature of the Left-Right divide. Those on the Right say that if people are free to make their own choices in life, and markets are competitive, then the outcomes produced by free people and competitive markets will be morally sound. As Miller puts it, markets reward morally virtuous behavior such as “work, responsibility, thrift, innovation, and risk-taking.” One can feel sympathy toward the less fortunate and show compassion, but there is no superior method for allocating resources. If one accepts markets as the best way to organize the economy, then one must accept their outcomes. Those on the Left argue that markets are a social construct, built on Social Technologies created by human beings to serve their own purposes. If a market economy is a socially constructed system, then we must be responsible for its outcomes. Furthermore, within that system, it is not virtue alone that determines outcomes. The lottery of birth plays a big role, in particular, inherited intelligence, wealth, looks, race, and geographic location. Given the influence of these factors, as Miller puts it, “it makes no sense to think that market outcomes could be presumptively moral.” Again, the two opposing poles can be explained by the principle of strong reciprocity. In crude terms, if whether one is rich or poor is the result of one’s own actions (the Right’s argument), then people deserve what they get. But if it is largely a matter of luck or factors outside an individual’s control (the Left’s argument), then they don’t. As with the question of selfishness versus altruism, these views were for a long time simply a matter of opinion. But thanks to the work of many researchers, there is now a significant body of evidence on this subject. Samuel Bowles of the Santa Fe Institute, Herb Gintis of the University of Massachusetts, and Melissa Osborne Groves of Towson University recently surveyed this work and concluded that neither the Left nor the Right is quite correct.
>
> A Lack of Social Mobility
>
> For the Right to be correct, there must be high social mobility. Through grit, determination, and hard work, the Horatio Algers of the world must be able to rise from rags to riches. These stories do indeed happen, particularly in the United States, but overall social mobility in the U.S. is lower than one might think. A study by Tom Hertz of American University, using data from 6,273 families observed over thirty-two years (from 1968 to 2000), showed that mobility was particularly low at the very poor and very rich ends of the spectrum (see table 18-1). If a set of parents were in the highest decile of income (i.e., top 10 percent), there was a 29.6 percent chance that their children would also grow up to be in the highest decile. Furthermore, looking down the top decile column of the table, one can see that there was a 59.1 percent chance of that same child remaining upper class (upper 3 deciles), and only a very small probability of the child dropping to the bottom of the income distribution. Conversely, a child born to bottom decile parents had a 31.5 percent chance of staying in the bottom decile, a two-thirds chance of remaining lower class, and only a slim 1.3 percent chance of making the Horatio Alger climb to the top. Finally, children born to middle-class parents (fifth decile) were most likely to remain middle class. This lack of economic mobility was even more marked for blacks. Only 17 percent of whites born into the lowest decile remained there, while the figure was 42 percent for blacks. “Aha!” cry those on the Left. “This is proof that we live in an unfair society that puts up barriers to achievement for the poor and minorities.” But not so fast. The causes of this lack of mobility are much more varied, and we need to unpeel the proverbial onion to see what is going on. First, we need to account for the effect of money simply given to children by their parents. This factor explained about 12 percent of the correlation between parental and child incomes. This then leaves unexplained the differences in what the offspring actually earned. We can next look at the ever-controversial nature-versus-nurture issue. Perhaps high-earning parents pass on their high-earning genes to their children. Studies of fraternal and genetic twins show that 12 percent of the correlation between parent and child earnings can be explained by genes, versus 28 percent by environment. In a separate study, only 5 percent of the earnings correlation was explained by IQ, which indicates that within the 12 percent explained by genes, other genetic traits, such as personality traits, must be at work, not just native intelligence (at least as measured by IQ). Thus, while genes are an important factor, they are not an overwhelming one. Other studies have looked at environmental factors such as education and race. Poor parents are more likely to send their children to poor schools, and racial discrimination might be a factor in both parent and child poverty. Perhaps surprisingly, schooling only accounted for 10 percent of parent-child income correlation, which suggests that other environmental factors must be at play as well. And race, when controlled for other demographic factors, was only 7 percent, so there must be more to the black-white gap than meets the eye. We thus have a mystery. There is a high correlation between parental and child income, so in effect wealth is inherited. But the two obvious inheritances from parents, cash and genes, only account for a modest part of the correlation. Meanwhile, environmental factors such as poor schools and racial discrimination appear not to close the explanatory gap. As these various factors account for only about a third of the total correlation, there is clearly something big that we get from our parents that is missing. Many researchers believe that the missing pieces from the equation are culturally driven behavior and social capital, the subjects of the previous two sections.
>
> The “Culture of Poverty”
>
> In a paper titled “The Apple Does Not Fall Far From the Tree,” a team of five researchers studied correlations in behaviors between parents and children.59 The team divided the behaviors into “prosocial behaviors,” such as completing school, attending church, and joining school clubs, and “delinquent behaviors,” such as drug use, sex before age fifteen, fighting, damaging property, and suspension from school. The researchers also looked at a number of personality traits that have economic consequences, such as self-esteem, depression, and shyness. They found, as the title of their paper suggests, substantial correlations between parents and children on these behaviors and personality traits. School-finishing, churchgoing club joiners were likely to have goody-two-shoes children, while brawling drug-takers were likely to have delinquents. Interestingly, the researchers did not find much effect from socioeconomic status; rich delinquents were about as likely to have delinquent children as were poor delinquents. Surprisingly, parenting style, measured on five dimensions (involvement, monitoring, child autonomy, emotional warmth, and cognitive stimulation), was much less significant than one might expect. It was the behaviors that parents themselves exhibited, not their parenting skills per se, that seemed to matter—the parental adage “do as I say and not as I do” does not appear to work. The researchers concluded that parental behavior has a strong influence on child behavior (not surprising to any parent), which in turn had a strong influence on future child earnings. Undoubtedly some parental behaviors have a genetic basis; for example, behaviors such as substance addiction, and disorders such as depression, have well-known genetic components. But as shown by the twin studies, overall, genetic factors play only a modest role in predicting future income. The other source of inherited behavior is the cultural norms and values that parents pass on to their children, leading to the conclusion that inherited culture must play a substantial role in individual economic outcomes. Again, this should not be surprising. If the micro rules of cultural behavior play a critical role in the economic performance of organizations and societies, one could also reasonably expect them to play a role in individual economic outcomes as well. The observation that culture is largely inherited from one’s parents, peer network, and local community provides a clear mechanism for at least partially explaining the lack of social mobility. If people in upper income strata have norms that encourage individual performance, cooperation, and innovation, those norms will be passed on to their children, who will then use those norms to achieve economic success, and in turn pass them on to their children. Likewise, people in lower income strata can become trapped with cultural norms that perpetuate antisocial and antieconomic behaviors across generations. In the 1960s Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously identified the “culture of poverty” as a leading cause of the persistence of an economic underclass in the United States. We can also extend this logic to argue that antisocial cultural norms lead to networks with weak social capital.61 Thus, individuals from dysfunctional cultures will also benefit less from their friends, neighbors, and associates.62 There will be fewer opportunities for cooperative activity, fewer exchanges of knowledge, and fewer opportunities to share risk. Young people will also have fewer role models and mentors willing to invest in them. In such cultures, the little social capital that exists may be found in less constructive groupings, such as gangs and networks of drug dealers. In contrast, those from prosocial cultures will experience the opposite. They will benefit significantly from the help of high-social-capital networks in which role models invest in the young, people use their networks to find jobs for each other, and success is celebrated and difficulties supported.
>
> Rawlsian Logic and Policy
>
> Where does this leave us in the Left-Right divide? The Right is correct in that individual responsibility still matters and positive behaviors often lead to positive outcomes. Cultural norms may explain the heritability and persistence of certain behaviors, but they do not morally excuse antisocial activities. Likewise, while social mobility may be lower than popularly perceived, the United States is still a relatively mobile society, particularly for the middle classes. But the Left is also correct. The birth-lottery of endowed wealth, native intelligence, and race taken together do play an important role in explaining economic outcomes (even if their individual contributions are modest). The birth-lottery argument becomes even more compelling if one adds culture to the lottery; after all, one cannot choose the culture that one is born into. From a policy perspective, neither the Left’s nor the Right’s usual solutions look very promising. Income redistribution does not address any of the behavioral issues (whether they stem from genes or culture), and a pure laissez-faire approach to the market does not seem right when it dooms so many people to a lifetime of poverty. Miller argues that we should abandon the Left-Right framing of this issue and instead take a stance borrowed from the philosopher John Rawls.63 We should ask ourselves the question, “If we did not know anything about our draw in the birth-lottery, what kind of a system would we want?” Thus, we would design the system before knowing whether we would be born to a wealthy investment banking family on the Upper East Side, or to a single-mother crack addict in the Bronx. The answer to this thought experiment, Miller contends, is that we would design a system that combines equality of upside opportunity with a downside social safety net. First, we would want as much a chance of climbing out of the Bronx as possible, but at the same time would not want to be penalized if we had the luck of being born to the banking family. Thus, the focus would be on helping poor people get rich, rather than economically punishing the rich. In particular, we would want to ensure that the school in the Bronx is just as good as the school available to the banker’s kid. We would also want to ensure that no unfair barriers, such as racism, were placed in the way. At the same time, we would want some downside protection. Even if the poor child works hard in school, he or she still might need some drug rehab for mom and help with food, housing, and health care to keep out of desperate straits. By the same token, the banker’s kid might sleep better at night knowing that if the family’s fortunes collapsed due to bad luck, there was some bottom to their fall. Miller translates his Rawlsian logic into four specific policy proposals. The first is to create universal health coverage by providing tax subsidies to enable people to buy health insurance from competing private health plans. The second is to raise the quality of public education, particularly for poorer children, by dramatically raising teacher salaries in exchange for union agreement to allow pay for performance. The third is a proposal to further reform education through a “grand bargain” between liberals and conservatives that would allow competition via a voucher system in exchange for de-linking education spending from property taxes (which ensure the richest kids get the best schools), and raising overall investment in education. Fourth, and finally, is a federal guarantee of a “minimum living wage” to put a floor under people’s incomes. Miller proposes to pay for these new initiatives by redirecting 2 percent of GDP to these priorities. Miller’s Rawlsian moral logic also has the benefit of appealing to our strong-reciprocity sense of fairness. Hard work and moral rectitude would be rewarded in these proposals but sloth would not, and bad luck would be treated with generosity. This appeal to strong reciprocity gives Miller’s proposals a good chance of being popularly supported—politicians take note.
>
> Changing Cultures and Creating a “Common Layer”
>
> While Miller’s proposals would certainly help remove barriers to advancement and protect some of the most vulnerable in society, they would not, however, address the deeper cultural basis of poverty and inequality. The subject of culture and poverty is a challenging one, particularly when it touches sensitive issues of race. Senator Moynihan, a Democrat and viewed by most as a liberal, was roundly attacked by the Left as a racist for his discussions of the culture of poverty in the 1960s. But a discussion of the culture of poverty does not automatically imply either a criticism of a particular minority cultures, nor carry a message that minorities need to “act white.” Just as there is nothing intrinsically Japanese or Norwegian about norms that support hard work, cooperation, and innovation, there is nothing inherently black, white, or brown about those cultural attributes either. Indeed, the growing class of African American CEOs, senior government officials, leading academics, and professionals is testament to the power of those norms and behaviors in action (and the fact that the children of such people tend also to be successful is further evidence). While there is no immutable link between race and culture, there is a link between culture and history. We saw this in Putnam’s study of northern versus southern Italy, and even in the simplified world of cooperating versus noncooperating agents in simulations. One can say that while overt racism has declined (but not been fully eliminated) as a barrier to economic mobility in America, the legacy of 250 years of slavery followed by a further 100 years of racial isolation has left its mark on the culture of many African American communities. The practical questions then are, what antisocial and antieconomic norms has that history created in the culture, and how can they be changed? This view reconciles the two often competing camps among African American political and religious leaders, between those on the Left who “blame society,” versus those on the Right who advocate “personal responsibility.” One can simultaneously acknowledge the wrongs of the past, while looking ahead to changes in norms and individual behaviors as the keys to escaping the cultural poverty trap. The positive message of this view is that cultures can and do change, even in the course of a few generations. Furthermore, cultures can change in ways that encourage economic progress without sacrificing other positive norms that give a culture its unique identity. For example, both Spain and Ireland have experienced substantial cultural change as well as record-breaking economic growth since the 1970s. Yet both countries have retained their respective Spanish-ness and Irish-ness. Eliminating the culture of poverty requires the changing of cultural norms, but it does not require a complete homogenization of the tapestry of American culture. That being said, however, all societies function better when there are broadly shared common norms. Trust tends to be higher and cooperation easier to create in homogeneous societies. A long-standing challenge for the United States, and a growing challenge for European countries with large immigrant communities, is how to engender trust and cooperation in a multi-ethnic, multicultural society. In an ideal world one would have a common layer of strong norms of what it means to be American (or British, or Brazilian, etc.) broadly shared by society. This common layer would include norms that support both democracy (e.g., the right to freedom of expression, the importance of participating in the political process) and economic achievement (e.g., the rewarding of hard work and innovation, the importance of education and self-improvement). It is this common layer of shared culture that cements together a democracy and provides a counter to the culture of poverty. Under this common layer, however, would be the rich variety of norms, traditions, and beliefs that make multicultural societies so dynamic. Creating the common layer, however, is a challenge that spans the political system, the education system, and the media. But it is a challenge that will become increasingly important as economic growth continues to leave too many citizens behind, and as societal tensions growing from immigration and globalization continue to rise. In many respects, America has been the most successful experiment in creating such a common layer. Excepting the historical exclusion of Native Americans and African Americans, the United States has had an unrivalled record in incorporating immigrants into its society and generating economic growth and opportunity. The documents created by the founding fathers were not just documents of law, they were statements of values. Those values served the country well for two centuries, but sometime during the social upheavals of the “Great Disruption,” the mechanisms for transmitting, renewing, and reinforcing those values in the nation’s families, schools, places of worship, media, and political institutions fell into disrepair. Reinvigorating and updating its culture for the modern world may be one of the most important tasks the United States faces in the new century. But it is not a challenge for the United States alone. Europe faces similar issues with integrating a population of 23 million Muslims, and determining whether the European Union is a cultural as well as an economic and political entity. Likewise, the rapid economic growth of China and India will undoubtedly bring wrenching cultural change. And finally, as discussed earlier, economic growth in the most impoverished countries of the world will not occur without cultural change to complement aid, investment, and structural reforms. Once again, none of these issues fits neatly into the Left-Right divide. As Senator Moynihan summed it up: “The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.”

> Future Directions
>
> In this chapter, I have attempted to give a sampling of some of the research applying ideas from Complexity Economics to important questions of public policy. There are, however, several other areas for which Complexity Economics may help increase our understanding. For example, Complexity Economics may not help us better forecast inflation but as discussed earlier, it can potentially help us manage macroeconomic policy more effectively by giving us new insights into the dynamics of the business cycle. A long-standing mystery of business cycles is why wages are too sticky and don’t fall enough to prevent recessions. In a perfectly rational society we would absorb economic downturns by all taking small cuts in wages rather than through large scale layoffs. Strong-reciprocity behavior may explain this conundrum as employees see wage cuts as unfair, and poor dynamic intuition means that they don’t realize that the downturn will result in increased unemployment instead... Margaret Thatcher once said, “There is no such thing as Society. There are individual men and women, and there are families.” From the perspective of Complexity Economics, she was simply wrong. The interactions of millions of people, making decisions, engaging in strong reciprocal behavior, acting out their cultural norms, cooperating, competing, and going about their daily lives, creates an emergent phenomenon that we call society—a phenomenon as real as the emergent pattern of a whirlpool. Within society are the constructs of states, markets, and communities, the three of which together create the economic world that we live in. We may not be able to control or predict the future direction of society, but we can endeavor to ensure that these three elements work together to create wealth, social capital, and opportunity. I have argued that Complexity Economics both transcends and obviates traditional Left-Right categorizations. It is not a mushy middle ground between the two poles, but rather a new perspective, a new dimension from which to view the problems. My personal hope is that by placing economics on a more scientific foundation, Complexity Economics can help reduce some of the bitter partisanship that has characterized political debate in the United States, particularly since the mid-1990s. After all, the citizens for whom policy makers work are not interested in who scores more points or who wins between the Left and Right; they just want to see their lives improve. Throughout this book, I have claimed that two institutions have provided the foundations of economic evolution: markets and science. To that score, we should add a third: democracy. Democracy is itself an evolutionary system of policy ideas. As E. M. Forster exclaimed, “Two cheers for democracy: one because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism.” Over the coming years, Complexity Economics will inject a new burst of variety into debates about politics and policy. It will be up to the evolutionary workings of the democratic process to select and amplify those ideas that will best serve society.
>
> ... There is thus no guarantee that we will stay on the explosive growth curve we have been riding since 1750. One must remember that such growth is a very recent phenomenon; thus far it has lasted for only 0.01 percent of human economic history. Staying on the growth path will require that we nurture and continue to evolve the Social Technologies that have provided its foundation: markets, science, and democracy. Even in the rich West, where these STs are the most deeply embedded, they should not be taken for granted. The United States, for example, has recently struggled with business scandals leading to a populist backlash against markets, a decline in science education, and a loss of competitiveness in its democracy (in the 2004 election, 98 percent of the members of Congress who stood for reelection were reelected).3 Economic evolution depends on the health of these STs and their constant renewal must be a priority... Sadly, large parts of the world, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, remain largely untouched by any of the three STs. In these parts of the world corruption, superstition, and Big Men still rule. Patiently building the institutions and culture required to support economic evolution is the only path for these countries out of poverty... the balance is tipped toward optimism, in no small part because it is now within our reach to understand complex human systems. We may not be able to predict or control these systems, but we can shape them through our actions... If, as individual consumers, workers, and voters, we ask the economy and our political institutions to maximize our short-term needs, to fill materialistic lives with ever more stuff, and to do so without regard for the health of our planet or the lives of future generations, then that is what we will get. But there is an alternative. Through the ways in which we spend our money, whom we choose to work for, our votes, and our voices, we can create a fitness function that requires our businesses, governments, and scientific institutions to take a longer-term view and to address the needs of global society in a broader and more sustainable way. If we create such a fitness function, then those institutions and our economy will by necessity adapt and respond to that call. Edmund Burke once said that a society is a “partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are [yet] to be born.” We are all a part of the global society of minds, and how that society evolves is up to each of us." - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)






> "The economy is a vast and complicated set of arrangements and actions wherein agents—consumers, firms, banks, investors, government agencies—buy and sell, speculate, trade, oversee, bring products into being, offer services, invest in companies, strategize, explore, forecast, compete, learn, innovate, and adapt. In modern parlance we would say it is a massively parallel system of concurrent behavior. And from all this concurrent behavior markets form, prices form, trading arrangements form, institutions and industries form. Aggregate patterns form. One of the earliest insights of economics—it certainly goes back to Smith—is that these aggregate patterns form from individual behavior, and individual behavior in turn responds to these aggregate patterns: there is a recursive loop. It is this recursive loop that connects with complexity. Complexity is not a theory but a movement in the sciences that studies how the interacting elements in a system create overall patterns, and how these overall patterns in turn cause the interacting elements to change or adapt. It might study how individual cars together act to form patterns in traffic, and how these patterns in turn cause the cars to alter their position. Complexity is about formation—the formation of structures—and how this formation affects the objects causing it.
>
> ... Complexity... is the study of the consequences of interactions; it studies patterns, or structures, or phenomena, that emerge from interactions among elements—particles, or cells, or dipoles, or agents, or firms... Complexity studies how such changes play out. Or, to put it another way, complexity studies the propagation of change through interconnected behavior.
>
> ... Next let us define the economy as the set of arrangements and activities by which a society fulfills its needs. These arrangements of course are the economy’s technologies. This is not a familiar way to look at the economy, but it fits well with the classical economists’ view of the economy as proceeding from its instruments of production. The economy we can then say emerges from its arrangements, its technologies: it is an expression of its technologies. Seen this way, the economy immediately becomes an ecology of its means of production (its technologies), one where the technologies in use need to be mutually supporting and economically consistent.
>
> ... There are two great problems in economics. One is allocation within the economy: how quantities of goods and services and their prices are determined within and across markets. This is represented by the great theories of general equilibrium, international trade, and game-theoretic analysis. The other is formation within the economy: how an economy emerges in the first place, and grows and changes structurally over time. This is represented by ideas about innovation, economic development, structural change, and the role of history, institutions, and governance in the economy. The allocation problem is well understood and highly mathematized, the formation one less well understood and barely mathematized.

> ... This type of behavior—coming up with appropriate hypothetical models to act upon, strengthening confidence in those that are validated, and discarding those that are not—is called inductive reasoning. It makes excellent sense where problems are ill defined. It is, in microscale, the scientific method. Agents who act by using inductive reasoning we will call inductively rational." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W.

> "All three authors agree in defining institutions as “the rules of the game,” without which economic action is unthinkable. They use the word “institution” in at least three senses: as the “rules” themselves (for example, bankruptcy laws); as the entities endowed with the social and political power to promulgate rules (for example, governments and courts); and as the socially legitimized constructions that instantiate rules and through which economic agents act (for example, fiat money and markets). In whichever sense institutions are construed, the three authors agree that they cannot be adequately understood from a purely economic, purely political, or purely social point of view. Economics, politics, and society are inextricably mixed in the processes whereby institutions come into being. And they change and determine economic, political, and social action... North takes up the question of the emergence of institutions from a functionalist perspective: institutions are brought into being “in order to reduce uncertainty,” that is, to make agents’ worlds predictable enough to afford recognizable opportunities for effective action. In particular, modern economies depend upon institutions that provide low transaction costs in impersonal markets." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W.

> "CHAPTER 6: All Systems Will Be Gamed - Exploitive Behavior in Economic and Social Systems
>
> ... There is a general rule in social and economic life: given any system, people will find a way to exploit it. Or to say this more succinctly: All systems will be gamed. I do not mean to be cynical here. Rather, I am making the general observation that given any governmental system, any legal system, regulatory system, corporate system, election system, set of policies, set of organizational rules, set of international agreements, people can—and will— find unexpected ways to exploit it to their advantage. “Show me a 50-foot wall,” said Arizona’s governor Janet Napolitano, speaking in 2005 of illegal immigration at the US-Mexico border, “and I’ll show you a 51-foot ladder.”
>
> ... The reason is that economics, in the way it is practiced, contains a bias that inhibits economists from seeing future potential exploitation. Economic analysis assumes equilibrium of the system in question, and by definition equilibrium is a condition where no agent has any incentive to diverge from its present behavior. It follows that for any system being studied invasive or exploitive behavior cannot happen: If a system could be invaded, some agents would be initiating new behavior, and the system could not have been in equilibrium. Equilibrium economics then, by its base assumptions, is not primed to look for the exploitation of systems, and as a result systematic studies of how systems might fail or be exploited are not central to how the discipline thinks.
>
> ... One good place to start is to look at how systems have been exploited or gamed in the past and point to general categories or motifs by which this happens. I will talk about four motifs and label these by their causes:
>
> 1. Use of asymmetric information. In many social systems, different parties have access to different information, and often one party offers a service or puts forward an opportunity based upon its understanding of the available information. Another party then responds with behavior based on its more detailed understanding and uses the system to profit from its privileged information. The financial and the marketing industries are particularly prone to such behavior; in each of these some parties are well informed about the product they are promoting, while others—the potential investors or customers—are not. In 2007 Goldman Sachs created a package of mortgage-linked bonds it sold to its clients. But it allowed a prominent hedge fund manager, John A. Paulson, to select bonds for this that privately he thought would lose value, then to bet against the package. Paulson profited, and so allegedly did Goldman by buying insurance against loss of value of the instrument; but investors lost more than $1 billion (Appleton, 2010). The package (a synthetic collateralized debt obligation tied to the performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities) was complicated, and its designers, Goldman and Paulson, were well informed on its prospects. Their clients were not...
>
> 2. Tailoring behavior to conform to performance criteria. A second type of exploitation—better to call it manipulation here—occurs when agent behavior is judged, monitored, or measured by strict criteria of evaluation and agents optimize their behavior to conform to these narrow criteria, rather than to what was more widely intended. Agents, in other words, game the criteria. Before the 2008 financial crisis, financial ratings agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s for years performed evaluations of the risk inherent in financial instruments proposed by investment and banking houses. A few years before the financial crash, in an act of transparency and implicit trust, they made their ratings models available to the Wall Street investment firms. Says Morgenson (2010): “The Wall Street firms learned how to massage these models, change one or two little inputs and then get a better rating as a result. They learned how to game the rating agency’s models so that they could put lesser quality bonds in these portfolios, still get a high rating, and then sell the junk that they might not otherwise have been able to sell.” Gaming performance criteria is not confined to Wall Street. It occurs within all systems where judgment of performance is important: conformance to the law; educational testing;6  adherence to standards of human rights; adherence to environmental standards; adherence to criteria for receiving funding; the production of output within factories; financial accounting; tax reporting; the performance of bureaucrats; the performance of governments. In all these cases, the parties under surveillance adjust their behavior to appear virtuous under the stated performance measures, while their actual behavior may be anywhere from satisfactory to reprehensible. In fact, in the case of government performance, two particular expressions of this form of exploitation already exist. One is Campbell’s law (1976): “the more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intend to monitor.” The other is Goodhart’s law (1975): “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”7  Both of these apply to governmental behavior. I prefer a broader truism:  Any performance criterion will be optimized against, and will thereby lose its value.
>
> 3. Taking partial control of a system. A third type of exploitation occurs when a small group of agents manages to take control of some significant portion of the resources of a system and use this for its own purposes. This is the economic equivalent of the way viruses operate. The group in effect takes over part of the machinery of the system and uses that to its own advantage. The financial sector has seen a great deal of this type of exploitation. Within the insurance giant AIG, some years before the 2008 crash, a small group of people (the Financial Products Unit) managed to take effective control of much of the company’s assets and risk bearing, and began to invest heavily in credit default swaps. The group profited greatly through their own personal compensation—they were paid a third of the profits they generated—but the investments collapsed, and that in turn sank AIG (Zuill, 2009). A similar set of events unfolded in Iceland, where a small group of entrepreneurs took out loans, used these to buy control of the assets of the country’s banks, and invested these in international properties and derivatives (Boyes, 2009; Jonsson, 2009). The international investments collapsed, and so did Iceland’s banks, along with their customers’ deposits.
>
> 4. Using system elements in a way not intended by policy designers. Still another type of exploitation happens when agents use the behavior of the system itself to manipulate the system. An example would be using a website’s rating possibilities to manipulate others’ ratings. Often too, players find a rule they can use as a loophole to justify behavior the designers of the system did not intend. Usually this forces a flow of money or energy through the rule, to the detriment of the system at large. Following the Arab Oil Embargo in the early 1970s, the US Congress set up fuel economy standards for motor vehicles. Understandably, the requirements for commercial light trucks were more lenient than those for passenger vehicles. But in due course and with a little congressional manipulation, Detroit found it could declare its sports utility vehicles to be light trucks. These then passed through the light-truck loophole, the highways in due course filled with SUVs, and between 1988 and 2005 average fuel economy actually fell in the United States (Pew, 2010). This was not what the energy policy’s designers intended.
>
> The four motifs I have described are by no means exhaustive; there are no doubt other ways in which systems might be gamed. But these give us a feel for the types of exploitation we might expect to see, and they show us that exploitive behavior is not rare in systems. It is rife.
>
> ANTICIPATING FAILURE MODES
>
> ... An obvious first step is to have at hand knowledge of how similar systems have failed in the past. We have at least the beginnings of such knowledge with the motifs I  described earlier. Aircraft designers know from forensic studies the causes by which failures (they call these “anomalies”) typically occur:  fatigue failure, explosive decompression, fire and explosions, burst engines (Bibel, 2008). By analogy, as I said, we need a failure mode analysis of how policy systems have been exploited in the past.
>
> Second, we can observe that in general the breakdown of a structure starts at a more micro level than that of its overall design. Breakdown in engineering designs happens not because the overall structure gives way, but because stresses cause hairline cracks in some part of an assembly, or some component assembly fails, and these malfunctions propagate to higher levels, possibly to cause eventual whole-system degradation. This suggests in our case that for any system we are studying, exploitive behavior will typically take place at a smaller scale than the overall system. Exploitive behavior after all is created—is “invented”—by individual people, individual human agents, or small groups of these, and we will have to have detailed knowledge of the options and possibilities agents possess if we want to understand how manipulation may happen.
>
> Third, and again by analogy, we can look for places of high “stress” in the proposed system and concentrate our attentions there. In social systems these places tend to be the points that present strong incentives for agents to do something different from their prescribed behavior. Typically, in an analytical model, points of behavioral action are represented as rates (the rate, say, at which individuals buy health insurance), or as simple rules (if income exceeds $X, and age exceeds Y, buy health insurance). The modeler needs to query whether simple rates or rules are warranted, given the pattern of incentives agents faces. Very often they are not.
>
> All this would suggest that if we have a design for social system and an analytical model of it, we can “stress test” it by first identifying where actual incentives would yield strong inducements for agents to engage in behavior different from the assumed behavior. These might, to give some examples, be places where agents have power to affect other players’ well-being (they can issue building permits, say, to wealthy property developers), yet we assume they make impartial decisions; or places where agents can profit by compromising on performance or safety of some activity (say, they decide on aircraft maintenance), yet we assume they conform to given standards; or places where agents have inside information (say, they have knowledge of a company’s future plans), yet we assume they do not trade on this information.
>
> ... What is important here is that we are looking for weak points in a policy system and the consequences that might follow from particular behaviors that system might be prone to. It is important that this testing not be rushed. In engineering it often takes months or years to painstakingly test, debug, and rework a novel design of importance, especially where public safety is at stake. There is no reason we should place less emphasis on the safety of economic and social policy outcomes." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W.

all of chapter 8 is good, it's part of his book "The Nature of Technology"

> "CHAPTER 8: The Economy Evolving as Its Technologies Evolve
>
> ... The standard way to define the economy—whether in dictionaries or economics textbooks—is as a “system of production and distribution and consumption” of goods and services. And we picture this system, “the economy,” as something that exists in itself as a backdrop to the events and adjustments that occur within it. Seen this way, the economy becomes something like a gigantic container for its technologies, a huge machine with many modules or parts that are its technologies—its means of production. When a new technology (the railroad for transportation, say) comes along it offers a new module, a new upgrade, for a particular industry:  the old specialized module it replaces (canals) is taken out and the new upgrade module is slid in. The rest of the machine automatically rebalances and its tensions and flows (prices and goods produced and consumed) readjust accordingly. This view is not quite wrong. Certainly it is the way I was taught to think about the economy in graduate school, and it is very much the way economic textbooks picture the economy today. But it is not quite right either. To explore structural change, I want to look at the economy in a different way.
>
> I will define the economy as the set of arrangements and activities by which a society satisfies its needs. (This makes economics the study of this.) Just what are these arrangements? ... The set of arrangements that form the economy include all the myriad devices and methods and all the purposed systems we call technologies. These include hospitals and surgical procedures. And markets and pricing systems. And trading arrangements, distribution systems, organizations, and businesses. And financial systems, banks, regulatory systems and legal systems. All these are arrangements by which we fulfill our needs, all are means to fulfill human purposes. Now, earlier in the book [Arthur, 2009] I defined technologies as means to human purposes, so all these are “technologies,” or purposed systems. So if we allow that the New  York Stock Exchange and the specialized provisions of contract law are as much means to human purposes as are steel mills and textile machinery, we can say that they too are in a wide sense technologies. If we include all these “arrangements” in the collective of technology, we begin to see the economy not as a container for its technologies, but as something constructed from its technologies. The economy is a set of activities and behaviors and flows of goods and services, mediated by—draped over— its technologies. It follows that the methods, processes, and organizational forms I have been talking about form the economy. The economy is an expression of its technologies. I am not saying that an economy is identical to its technologies. There is more to an economy than this. Strategizing in business, investing, bidding, and trading—these are all activities and not purposed systems. What I  am saying is that the structure of the economy is formed by its technologies, that technologies if you like form the economy’s skeletal structure. The rest of the economy—the activities of commerce, the strategies and decisions of the various players in the game, the flows of goods and services and investments that result from these—form the muscle and neural structure and blood of the body-economic. But these parts surround and are shaped by the set of technologies, the purposed systems, that form the structure of the economy. The shift in thinking I am putting forward here is not large; it is subtle. It is like seeing the mind not as a container for its concepts and habitual thought processes but as something that emerges from these. Or seeing an ecology not as containing a collection of biological species, but as forming from its collection of species. So it is with the economy. The economy forms an ecology for its technologies, it forms out of them, and this means it does not exist separately. And as with an ecology, it forms opportunity niches for novel technologies and fills these as novel technologies arise. This way of thinking carries consequences. It means that the economy emerges—wells up—from its technologies. It means that the economy does more than readjust as its technologies change, it continually forms and re-forms as its technologies change. And it means that the character of the economy—its form and structure—change as its technologies change. In sum, we can say this:  As the collective of technology builds, it creates a structure within which decisions and activities and flows of goods and services take place. It creates something we call “the economy.” The economy in this way emerges from its technologies. It constantly creates itself out of its technologies and decides which new technologies will enter it. Notice the circular causality at work here. Technology creates the structure of the economy, and the economy mediates the creation of novel technology (and therefore its own creation). Normally we do not see this technology-creating-the-economy-creating-technology. In the short term of a year or so the economy appears given and fixed; it appears to be a container for its activities. Only when we observe over decades do we see the arrangements and processes that form the economy coming into being, interacting, and collapsing back again. Only in the longer reaches of time do we see this continual creation and re-creation of the economy.
>
> STRUCTURAL CHANGE
>
> What happens to this system that forms from its technologies as new technologies enter? We would still see the same adjustments and fresh combinations I spoke about in chapter 8 of course; they are perfectly valid. But we would see something more: the addition of new technologies setting in motion a train of changes to the structure of the economy, to the set of arrangements around which the economy forms... In practice a new technology may call forth new industries; it may require that new organizational arrangements be set up; it may cause new technical and social problems and hence create new opportunity niches; and all these themselves may call forth further compositional changes... I have really just stated in economic terms the steps described in the previous chapter that form the mechanism by which the collective of technology evolves. But I  am interpreting these steps to describe how a new structure for the economy forms. When a novel technology enters the economy, it calls forth novel arrangements—novel technologies and organizational forms. The new technology or new arrangements in turn may cause new problems. These are answered by further novel arrangements (or by existing technologies modified for the purpose), which in their turn may open needs for yet more novel technologies. The whole moves forward in a sequence of problem and solution—of challenge and response—and it is this sequence we call structural change. In this way the economy forms and re-forms itself in spates of change, as novelty, new arrangements to accommodate this, and the opening of resulting opportunity niches follow from each other... Structural change in the economy is not just the addition of a novel technology and replacement of the old, and the economic adjustments that follow these. It is a chain of consequences where the arrangements that form the skeletal structure of the economy continually call forth new arrangements.
>
> ... In the economy, solutions lead to problems, and problems to further solutions, and this dance between solution and problem is unlikely to change at any time in the future. If we are lucky we experience a net benefit that we call progress... Because the economy is an expression of its technologies, it is a set of arrangements that forms from the processes, organizations, devices, and institutional provisions that comprise the evolving collective; and it evolves as its technologies do. And because the economy arises out of its technologies, it inherits from them self-creation, perpetual openness, and perpetual novelty. The economy therefore arises ultimately out of the phenomena that create technology; it is nature organized to serve our needs. There is nothing simple about this economy. Arrangements are built one upon another: the commercial parts of the legal system are constructed on the assumption that markets and contracts exist; and markets and contracts assume that banking and investment mechanisms exist. The economy therefore is not a homogeneous thing. It is a structure—a magnificent structure— of interacting, mutually supporting arrangements existing at many levels that has grown itself from itself over centuries. It is almost a living thing, or at least an evolving thing, that changes its structure continually as its arrangements create further possibilities and problems that call forth further responses— yet further arrangements." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W. Brian Arthur](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22693584-complexity-and-the-economy)

> "CHAPTER 9: On the Evolution of Complexity
>
> ... Viewed this way, the origin of life is very much the emergence of a software system carried by a physical system—the emergence of a programmable system learning to program itself... In this chapter, I  have suggested three ways in which complexity tends to grow as evolution takes place. It may grow by increases in diversity that are self-reinforcing; or by increases in structural sophistication that break through performance limitations; or by systems “capturing” simpler elements and learning to “program” these as “software” to be used to their own ends. Of course, we would not expect such growth in complexity to be steady. On the contrary, in all three mechanisms we would predict it to be intermittent and epochal. And we would not expect it to be unidirectional. The first two mechanisms are certainly reversible, so we would expect collapses in complexity to occur randomly from time to time. As we study evolution more deeply, we find that biology provides by no means all of the examples of interest. Any system with a lineage of inherited, alterable structures pressured to improve their performance shows evolutionary phenomena. And so, it is likely that increasingly we will find connections between complexity and evolution by drawing examples not just from biology, but from the domains of economics, adaptive computation, artificial life, and game theory. Interestingly, the mechanisms described in this chapter apply to examples in all of these evolutionary settings." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W.

> "CHAPTER 11: The End of Certainty in Economics
>
> ... We act on our forecasts or expectations, and so our expectations create the world—the outcome—our expectations are trying to predict. Without knowledge of others’ expectations, or knowledge that everyone has knowledge of others’ expectations, an agent’s expectations become impossible to formulate logically and so do others’ expectations. Rational expectations thus become dubious and fragile assumptions, and the real world is subject to fundamental uncertainty. This indeterminacy means that economic behavior builds from subjective beliefs; these arise, co-evolve, change, mutually reinforce, mutually negate, and decay. I argue that economics should recognize and accept such subjective reasoning as its basic premise.
>
> ... When our ideas and preferences co-create the world they are trying to forecast, self-reference renders the problem indeterminate. The idea that we can separate the subjects of the economy—the agents who form it—from the object, the economy, is in trouble. Pockets of indeterminism are present everywhere in the economy... Ceilings and floors emerge as partially self-fulfilling prophecies, held in place by their being convenient sell and buy places. We are now a long way from homogeneous rational expectations. Under the realistic assumption that traders may interpret the same information differently, expectations become indeterminate and unstable. And they may become mutually self-fulfilling.
>
> ... In the standard view, which has come down from the Enlightenment, the economy is an object. It is complicated but can be viewed mechanistically. Subject and object—agents and the economy they perform in—can be neatly separated. The view I am giving here is different. It says that the economy itself emerges from our subjective beliefs. These subjective beliefs, taken in aggregate, structure the micro economy. They give rise to the character of financial markets. They direct flows of capital and govern strategic behavior and negotiations. They are the DNA of the economy. These subjective beliefs are a-priori or deductively indeterminate in advance. They co-evolve, arise, decay, change, mutually reinforce, and mutually negate. Subject and object cannot be neatly separated. And so the economy shows behavior that we can best describe as organic, rather than mechanistic. It is not a well-ordered, gigantic machine. It is organic. At all levels it contains pockets of indeterminacy. It emerges from subjectivity and falls back into subjectivity." - [Complexity and the Economy, by W.

> "In the Scandinavian languages there is actually a common word that roughly translates into “management of a household” or “to economize”: “hushålla”/”husholde”, literally “to hold house”. It’s a verb, meaning that it’s something you do. But what is it, most fundamentally, that you do, when you are “holding house” or “economizing”?
>
> Yes, it includes the management of limited assets, manufactured goods and natural resources and the work included in producing and distributing these things. But you’re managing something more fundamental than that, something that goes beyond the concrete work tasks and physical resources: namely, our most limited resource – time and attention.
>
> Economy is about the management of our time and attention. Money and work are just abstractions and surface phenomena of these two much more fundamental aspects. Money is merely a crude measure of evaluating the worth of someone’s actions in relation to someone else, and what we see as “actual” work is merely a social construct, a convention and definition of what is considered to be actions creating economic value for others – in our day and age usually the kind of actions by which a monetary exchange takes place.
>
> Our time and attention is more fundamental than money and work. It’s what is at the very core of the economy. For example, you reading this text and giving me your attention is an economic action. You could have done something else, but you chose to, you economized, those scarce resource (that is, your valuable time and attention) to read. In that regard all our actions are economic priorities. All of them. Taking a hike in the forest, talking to your neighbor or doing activism are all economic actions. You could have done something else.
>
> Hence “economy”, or to “economize”, is all about behaviors and relations. It’s about the behaviors we spend our time doing and towards which relations we direct our attention.

> You won’t find the essence of economy from studying the wizardry of stock exchange brokers, bankers and other financial occupations that we’re so accustomed to. The economy runs much deeper than the numerical values presented by statistics on monetary exchanges.

> ... Capitalism is simply the management of human surplus by means of money capital.
>
> ... Investing the surplus of human labor in new productive measures is basically the core of capitalism; and that goes whether it is the state or a private entrepreneur who does it. (This means that Soviet communism wasn’t less “capitalist” than its counterpart in the West, hence it has often been termed “state capitalism”.)

> ... In the end, money capital outcompeted violence as the most effective means of coordinating people’s productive actions. It beat it at its own game by subordinating it to the logic of money.
>
> ... So, what could be the means to outcompete the logic of money capital? Only if you can reliably organize and coordinate the behaviors of millions of people by another logic than money, then will you have created a relation between humans that is non-capitalist. But for that you’ll actually need another form of capital, and remember, there are many forms of capital out there so what could it be?

> ... The end result will not be a classless society. One class structure will just replace another. At the top of this new social hierarchy we’ll find the so called “netocrats” (a notion put forth by the philosopher Alexander Bard), the masters of the symbols and information, and at the bottom a class of people who merely consume what the netocrats produce, the consumtariat. Those who direct attention – and those who are left in the audience. In this new economy the concern with physical property will decrease because of the abundance, and the means to acquire it, money, will thus decrease in importance, especially among the ruling netocrat elite more preoccupied with all the things money can’t buy. Money will thus lose some its power over people; it won’t motivate them as much since other concerns than property are perceived more desirable, and money capital won’t be able to manage people behaviors to the same extent as before, that is, make them do what money used to make them do. When people’s material needs are met it’s not more money they are after, but emotional needs such as good relations, self-esteem and self-realization. And for that you need attention, you want people’s recognition – and when working with information or symbols, as more people are doing, one’s work is essentially worthless without other people paying attention to you.
>
> ... With the proper use of symbols one can actually make someone do what you want them to do with a will and desire that guns and money can’t compete with. People might alter their behaviors because they are scared of your gun, or because they need money to pay their bills, but getting them excited and wanting to do the best they can requires more delicate measures. And if they aren’t scared or have enough money to pay their bills, being able to master such symbols is much more powerful. And who cares about someone offering you a carrot if you just ate... And by the way, why are you still reading this piece, it’s pretty long, and you are not getting paid? Some exciting symbols made you keep reading this text because it causes some amount of emotional energy.

> "Profit is not really the same as economic growth. Profit means, seen as a relation between human beings, that somebody gains a relative power to decide what work should be done. The economy grows, and then somebody makes profit by leveraging their relative position in the economy, so that they gain the power to get others to do their bidding, simply by paying them. Profit is something that happens in the spur of the moment, when there is a certain imbalance or inequality to profit from. Profit is a relative and relational thing.

We are looking at the growth of an info-financial-industrial complex... As the scale-free network becomes greater and denser, the relative financial power of those at its center to make profit, from their relational advantage, increases.
