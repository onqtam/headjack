> "Democracies have not eradicated oligarchy, they have driven it to secrecy, a state of affairs ironically most abhorrent in a democracy. Instead of confronting the problems inherent in an oligarchy, democracy denies it exists while practicing it openly. Oligarchy is not necessary, but it can only be overcome in a completely open and transparent system which allows the most widespread participation by all and knowledge for all and recognizes and accommodates expertise and greater levels of knowledge." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "When a round peg does not fit in a square hole despite numerous attempts we do not say it has not been tried, we say it doesn’t work." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Representative democracies do not provide for expertise in governance as representatives are elected by land mass and time span, not system, and are usually elected for charisma, not expertise. Athenian sortition likewise made no attempt at combining expertise with authority. Subjects that the majority is unqualified to speak on are delegated to similarly unqualified political representatives, segregated from other representatives by land mass. These representatives appoint experts who obtain their positions by cronyism with the politician instead of expertise acknowledged by the entire interested population.
>
> The politicians and experts in the current system then provide for no meaningful feedback from users of the system, outside of occasional polls. These polls are conducted on test populations which another group have decided shall be considered representative of the population as a whole and used to provide input on only the questions the experts decide. There is no transparency of any meaningful kind that would allow users of the system to audit what the experts were doing.
>
> We can do better than this. We can govern by user groups, respect individual rights and global commons, and collaborate using stigmergy. We can belong to overlapping societies voluntarily by acceptance of social contracts. Where necessary, elite expertise can be contained and used through transparent epistemic communities with knowledge bridges while control remains with the user group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The first goal of nation states is to defend their citizens against the ‘other’, an idea which has led, and will continue to lead, to divisive politics and human rights violations." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Group representation of individuals contributes to the infantilization of the individuals and allows them to relax and not educate themselves or take part in their own governance." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The single greatest tool for making moral people commit atrocities is group affiliation. The single greatest tool for promoting global human rights and equality is to end group affiliation." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The idea that only a lawyer can understand the law was created to disguise the undermining of the basic principles of society. In order for a social contract to be binding, the principles must be easily taught to anyone, including children. No law must ever deviate from the principles of the social contract, therefore law ought to be largely intuitive." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The fact that the legal system has remained so archaic strongly suggests that it is meant to remain inaccessible and subjective as that is best serving the interests of those in power. The discouragement people once faced for obtaining online medical advice, particularly from their peers, is greatly compounded for legal advice. This must change. People must recreate the legal systems to work for them, and that requires direct involvement at every level in the creation and implementation of the laws. The law, more than any other part of society, must be transparent, accessible, equal, and created by and for the people." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Society with its dependencies and relationships has been converted to a completely monetized system of dissociation. For the first time in human history, people have been effectively dissociated from each other and are living in a state of no society." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "A public that was involved in helping to enforce laws could accomplish far more than a police force could by itself. Instead of blocking the entire internet under the pretense of blocking child porn sites, the police could just ask or allow the public to police the internet. If child porn or terrorist plotting sites can be found by anyone, they can be found by everyone. What is required is not secrecy and censorship but a proper structure for policing which involves the public." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Entire industries would be made redundant by adherence to the principle of transparency for public organizations. Transparency in its literal sense, not selected pieces of isolated information wrapped up and presented by an official but full transparency, of the kind that would allow any passerby to see exactly what an organization was up to. As the current powers have been asking private individuals for decades, what do they have to hide? The kind of radical transparency that private individuals have been exposed to needs to be turned on all organizations and actions which have any impact on the public. Individuals require a right to privacy. Collaborativesociety requires full knowledge of organizations and actions which affect the public." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "A culture in which fame is the ultimate achievement cannot understand the value of ownerless ideas and shapeshifting personas. Anonymity has been equated almost exclusively with criminal activity by politicians and lawmakers." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "In many cases, anonymity is the only way for a messenger to ensure their message will be heard. Very often the story of the messenger will override the message. That is the way corporate media has been increasingly covering the news. We are at this point left with only messengers, rarely any message at all, and it is what audiences are trained to look for." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Representative democracies are part of a personality driven celebrity culture where people are encouraged to support their chosen personalities or groups in any action they take. This has changed from recent history, where celebrity culture existed but was moderated. People were encouraged to choose principles they supported and ensure those principles were met by any action, regardless of the actor. The advantage of a personality driven system to those in power is it allows them to disregard the principles agreed to in a social contract. It also makes favour swapping and influence peddling the preferred methods of negotiation rather than simply negotiating each action on its own merits." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While intellectual property rights need to be abolished as they are inhibiting progress and being used as a tool of inappropriate permanent economic control and intimidation, idea credit rights need far more recognitionand need to start being applied to the originator, not the copyright or patent holders. Credit theft is a severe impediment to equality. It is as common now as ever for a person with access to powerful forums to pick up an idea from a person unable to reach the public and use it to enhance their own reputation... Credit for one’s work or ideas is the right of every person. Credit provides the human dignity of societal recognition, approval and belonging. Credit for ideas and actions is an inherent part of personal identity. Unlike copying, which is not theft, taking credit deprives the rightful owner of it and is theft. There is no need to ever hide the origin of information unless the ultimate goal is to isolate them and suppress or twist their messages or use their work to glorify another." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "We need a system where urgent local news can be collected and amplified globally when necessary, and where the people of the world decide which news is important, not official news channels or celebrity nodes." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "While most action based systems can be completely open to participation by anyone, there are situations where an elite level of knowledge and accreditation of some sort is necessary prior to participation. Complicated surgery or engineering are examples of this type of work. While accreditation can and should come from the user group and be completely transparent and permeable, ability in many cases can only be reviewed by those who have attained an above average level of specialized knowledge. In these cases, there must be peer acknowledged levels of expertise attached to specific people, a situation not compatible with pure stigmergy or horizontal action.
>
> Idea based systems such as some scientific research, which should be open to all contributions, require extensive feedback and peer review of ideas, both to identify signal from noise and to provide knowledge bridges between elite levels of knowledge and casual users. In many specialized systems such as the pharmaceutical industry, the entire user group has an urgent interest in ensuring that ideas are properly audited but few have the interest or ability to inform themselves to the level necessary to be able to audit. No one has the time to inform themselves to an expert level of knowledge in every system which affects them, even if that information is completely transparent and available to all. In these systems, ideas need to be promoted by those users qualified to understand them.
>
> It is necessary to define a form of elitism, of ideas or people, that will take advantage of expertise but not remove control of a system from the end users. Ignoring elite knowledge in favour of a pretense at completely horizontal governance will not eliminate elitism, it willonly create hidden oligarchies dominated by those without the expertise required, usually celebrity personalities.
>
> In allowing this form of elitism, ultimate choice must always be left with the entire user group. An epistemic community is a knowledge resource only. Superior knowledge can only be forced to work for the wellbeing of the entire user group if authority remains with the entire user group and the epistemic community is forced to remain completely transparent and permeable. Science may dream of brilliant innovations, but the user group controls whether those are implemented or created. This authority also provides the incentive for transparency and knowledge bridges to explain reasoning to the entire group." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Promoting ideas also allows auditing of an idea without all the unrelated distraction of attached personalities." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "It is the responsibility of each user in an open system to educate themselves to their own level of comfort using the data and user population at each level to inform themselves. Their input and decision making impact would then be commensurate with the expertise they acquire. The epistemic community in the centre should not need to protect themselves from demands orattacks from completely uninformed users. The circles of expertise which promoted them to the centre should also verify and explain their findings to the outer circles" - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "In representative democracy we have learned that people in general prefer to place their faith in leaders who are like them instead of leaders who are so expert they do not understand them. In order to avail ourselves of the greatest expertise on each topic, we must place our mostknowledgeable experts in a position of transparent authority while also providing a knowledge bridge leading from their ideas to the casually interested observer." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The keys to allowing elite expertise but not allowing for elite conspiracies are transparency and knowledge bridges." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The key to preventing elite knowledge from becoming a tyrannical oligarchy is to maintain control by the user group over action and decisions and treat epistemic communitiesalways as a knowledge resource, not a governing power." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Open source software with forums open to all are a perfect working example of fully transparent and audited systems of elite knowledge. While the decisions are made by the developers, review and acceptance or rejection of the software is the right of the user group. If the developers refuse to listen to the user group and another development team is willing to work on the project, the original code can be forked and modified to meet the user requirements." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Online courses such as those offered by Coursera where students teach each other and have direction from an epistemic community of instructors with knowledge bridges of graduates and fellow students is another example of a concentric circle in the cases where the course material is released as creative commons." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "The influence of celebrities from entertainment and sports industries over unrelated topics is illogical but widespread and they are more than ever expected to use that influence in areas completely outside their knowledge sphere." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "A cultural shift is required around celebrity. Celebrity was created to distract attention from issues the true oligarchies did not want scrutinized. The public’s ‘right to know’ was transferred from the business of the government to the plastic surgery of an entertainer." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "Most systems are now run by competitive organizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow and wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement, and more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks progress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and ideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the potential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between the people with the greatest expertise does not happen unless they are hired by the same project." - [Stigmergy, by Heather Marsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20160117235400/https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/)

> "In a competitive environment, a new idea is jealously guarded, legally protected and shrouded in secrecy. Great effort is expended in finding supporters for the idea while also ensuring that the idea remains covered by legal protections such as non-disclosure agreements. The idea remains inextricably bound to the creator until it is legally transferred to another owner and all contributors work for the owner, not the idea. Contributors must then be rewarded by the owner which further limits the potential for development and wastes more resources in legal agreements, lawsuits, etc. Contributors have no interest in whether the project succeeds or fails and no motivation to contribute more than they are rewarded for." - [Stigmergy, by Heather Marsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20160117235400/https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/)

> "It is neither reasonable nor desirable for individual thought and action to be subjugated to group consensus in matters which do not affect the group." - [Stigmergy, by Heather Marsh](https://web.archive.org/web/20160117235400/https://georgiebc.wordpress.com/2012/12/24/stigmergy-2/)



> "If there was ever a need for political representation or a paternalistic and opaque authority it has been removed by technology. Every political system we have tried has proven incapable of protecting human rights and dignity. Every political system we have tried has devolved into oligarchy. To effect the change we require immediately, to give individuals control and responsibility, to bring regional systems under regional governance, allow global collaboration and protect the heritage of future generations, we need a new political model." - [Heather Marsh](https://kevinbeynon.com/bindingchaos#:~:text=If%20there%20was,new%20political%20model.)

> "Information freedom is the freedom to access, participate in, understand and benefit from knowledge creation.

> "We could have complete, transparent, participatory knowledge accessible to all, audited at every level of understanding, and protect privacy for everyone. Local governance could be both informed and autonomous and we could collaborate with a speed and accuracy that might just give us a chance to solve the problems we are facing before it is too late. Everyone would have the equal ability to make informed choices at their chosen level of understanding. We could have a universal reality, informed by information from all sources, and we could make decisions free of state and corporate coercion." - [Heather Marsh](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10282556-we-could-have-complete-transparent-participatory-knowledge-accessible-to-all)

The future is in collaborative investigators sharing knowledge to map everything we need to know to govern ourselves. The future is in activism and aid requested directly by the people who require it and responded to directly by the people who can provide it.

!!! Actually... "Binding Chaos" is crap - word salad & white man hating. ALL quotes by Heather should be scrutinized and maybe discarded.
====================================================

> "The Global Brain is a big idea. The Singularity is a big idea. The Global Brain Singularity is an even bigger idea. The Global Brain represents the idea that all humans and machines on planet Earth are forming (or already forms) an organized totality that will allow (or is allowing) higher order coherence without precedence in evolutionary history. The name ‘Global’ captures the ‘totalizing’ aspect of the phenomenon (all humans and all machines in one system); the name ‘Brain’ captures the metaphorical homology between the structure and function of biological brains and the structure and function of human civilization. The Singularity, in contrast, and specifically in the context of sociotechnological theory, represents the idea of a future qualitative transition in the phenomenal nature of human life. This future qualitative transition is typically described as a technologically mediated transcendence of our nature towards a transhuman or a posthuman horizon. When we combine the idea of the ‘Global Brain’ with the idea of the ‘Singularity’ we are trying to understand the immanence of both human beings and human civilization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "What does it mean that a being has come into being which is modelling being and itself in increasingly recursive modalities?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary view is not deterministic and so we cannot say that the future emergence of a common governance and energy regime will be achieved. However, the possibility of such a common metasystem is the highest potentiality of a Global Brain Singularity." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "What does it mean to live within an evolutionary universe and be agents of fundamental evolutionary processes? We simply do not have sensical and well-defined answers to these questions. We are used to thinking about the human species as living in an immutable relation to some transcendental structure which exists and persists independent of our existence or action. What in the world happens to our understanding when the transcendental structure that overdetermines our existence becomes something that not only changes across time but is also something constituted by our action and modalities of being?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The failure to understand culture, and in particular the relationship between biology and culture as part of cosmic evolution, may be one of the primary failings of science in the modern world. This is a factor in holding back progress in our understanding of both the nature of humanity and the future of humanity." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Both reductionism and postmodernity, albeit successful in different ways within the sciences and humanities, cannot help us in terms of formulating a better understanding of universal history and its meaning for the human species moving forward into our common future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Throughout scientific history we have come to imagine ourselves as separate, marginal or accidental by-products in a meaningless universe. In fact, it has not been uncommon for scientific progress in understanding the universe to become coupled with a type of existential nihilistic worldview in relation to the human phenomenon." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Whatever ‘act’ comes next in the ‘cosmic drama’ it will emerge from within the domain of collective human social values, cultural creativity and our exploration of latent technological possibility. In this way the universe gives the appearance of internalizing its future potentiality within a network of billions of biocultural nodes that in aggregate represent a phenomenon capable of producing yet another level of complex organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Big history could be a chance to develop, eventually, a collective map making process to orient and guide humanity into the deeper future. What does it mean for future human action to be connected in a chain of evolutionary processes from the emergence of spacetime to the present? In this context big history has the opportunity to become simultaneously one story of our shared world as well as an infinite number of stories of how individuals can relate to that world and act in that world... Consequently, big history offers humanity a deeper perspective and an opportunity for cosmic reflection in relation to the meaning of human life from an exploration of the processes that culminated in our existence." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The evolutionary-cybernetic properties of differentiation and integration are necessary to understand the growth of complexity. This is because networked patterns of interconnected distinctions inherently characterize increasingly complex systems, irrespective of material substrate. These increasingly complex networks enable multi-level adaptive capabilities (i.e. higher organism-environment relations) exhibiting emergent properties that are completely absent at lower levels of organization. Thus by studying the way differentiation and integration have progressed via new forms of cooperation big historians can identify commonality in the evolutionary processes that enabled continuous local development of hierarchical ordered levels. From this conceptual framework we can start to build a comprehensive view of the local universe as a region of ever-complexifying relationships, which produce new levels of organization facilitated by higher levels of awareness, and consequently, new living system goals and values in relation to the cosmic object. In elucidating the complexifying connections between all historical processes we may be able to provide a foundation for understanding both our contemporary world and our potential future." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "All living systems must be dynamically embedded or embodied in their environment, allowing them to define context-dependent functional survival and reproduction goals, as well as overcome challenges in relationship with their socioecological circumstances. As a result, all living systems define, either perceptually or conceptually, boundaries between internal organization and the environment. These boundaries serve the dual function of protecting achieved internal organization (i.e. ‘self’) as well as enabling further growth and learning from interaction with the environment (i.e. active knowledge construction), the latter of which is bounded only by finite available energy and the internal cognitive information processing capabilities of the living system. From this perspective the life history of biological systems can be defined by this process of controlling available energy and directing it intelligently towards goals and values that have a biological or cultural relation to survival, growth and reproduction." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Unlike biological evolution, which operates on the generational selection of functional chemical information structured by the genome, cultural evolution operates on the real-time selection of functional symbolic information structured by language. As a consequence, biological structures like genes, chromosomes and genomes - as well as cultural structures like ideas, theories and worldviews - are subject to evolutionary selection pressures in humans. This functional symbolic information can produce both adaptive behaviours and adaptive technology." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As a general principle, the more faithfully a society can store and transmit cultural information between cultural beings and across cultural generations, the less functional cultural information is lost (i.e. ‘backward slippage’), and the easier it becomes for any given cultural collective to build upon the complexity of inherited cultural knowledge (i.e. ‘ratcheting’). In this sense, the speed of cultural change is a rough function of the qualitative efficiency and quantitative number of conversations (i.e. idea sharing/sex) being conducted within and between individuals and populations." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution, or the reproduction of symbolic code, will not necessarily remain dependent on a biological substrate indefinitely." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "There is a struggle of ideas, theories and worldviews within the symbolic order, but this struggle is an increasingly conscious struggle for the universality of the symbolic order itself. Thus in the cultural evolutionary context progressive symbolic differentiation does give the signal of approaching an internal closure of the process itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Even in the face of overwhelming global obstacles (or even because we face overwhelming global obstacles), we cannot forget the hope for a higher world: a world where the structural conditions of civilization enable the highest flourishing of the human creative imagination; or even: the distributed emergence of a collective common goal that does not rest on an external necessary God [either religious (/supernatural), governmental (/bureaucratic), or market (/financial)] but on an internally generated intersubjective value system supporting collective freedom and immortality (a true universality)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We need different modes of sociopolitical governance. Complex systems science teaches us that local, bottom-up and distributed coordination are typically the most effective and capable mechanisms for enabling emergent global order in highly complex environments. This is because, in complex systems, there are simply too many differentiated parts for effective top- down mechanisms for coordination to stably function and synergize the whole. Thus any global systems science and serious sociopolitical global development agenda must understand how to maintain a new planetary organization with dynamic and distributed mechanisms that lead to self-organization (as opposed to static and hierarchical historical mechanisms that produce centralized organization)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

According to MST, higher levels of control organization can emerge from the coordination of less ordered subsystems. This type of higher coordination is hypothesized to emerge from the selection for more advanced information processing and communications, which enables previously disparate entities to synergistically coordinate their activities. Consequently, such systemic transitions change the relationship between the parts they are composed of, and (if successful) lead towards new emergent and stable characteristics of the whole, through the exploration of (in our context) new (sociotechnological) connections, new (sociotechnological) distinctions, and consequently, new (sociotechnological) possibility spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

However, remaining symbolically faithful to the nation-state, when its function as a structural control is so clearly endangering socioeconomic and ecological progress is dangerous as many of our most pressing problems related to economics, ecology and social space do not have borders (i.e. they are global, with an earth-space boundary only)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

This reinvention could allow for the establishment of controls that maximize distributed intelligence and direct democracy within a digital medium that functions from ‘local to global’. Of course, this will require massive control innovation and a cultural revolution committed to radical distribution of concentrated power. Here we can learn from the founders of enlightenment if we have the daring to actually realize their transcendent dreams. There is no reason why control needs to possess a specific physical location in a truly mature information age.

In the theoretical commons form the center loses its ‘agential dimension’ and instead emerges from the collective interaction of agential consciousness. In this sense the center gains its coherence only from the distributed problem definition and opportunity exploration of the network of agential consciousness in-itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The failure of religious institutions, particular the Abrahamic religious institutions, to become more decentralized and distributed has arguably defined by their controversial existence throughout the industrial era. Indeed the majority of the atheist critique of religion has little to do with serious transcendental arguments related to the existence or nonexistence of God, and much more to do with social system repression, power and control, which is a feature of centralized and hierarchical organizations. Moreover there has been a recent flourishing of spiritual belief systems and spiritual practices that are capable of expressing the human relationship to the divine without the strict adherence to a single text or scripture.
>
> In this nuanced perspective it becomes difficult to know exactly how to interpret the future of religion with any absolute certainty. However, in the challenge propagation framework we can say that the future of spirituality or belief in the supernatural must figure out how to reinvent itself within the context of a structural reorganization of how humans relate to the spirit. Humans have inherent spiritual needs and these needs can manifest in many different ways. In order to foster this spiritual need for faith in a higher power or source or cause of existence the best practice in a challenge propagation framework would be to create the discursive spaces where a real active dialogue about spirituality and faith can emerge. These discursive spaces need not represent one religious leader or one religious domination but allow for conceptual boundaries to be flexible and dynamic and contingent on the needs expressed in the dialogue.
>
> If this model is useful in a prescriptive and predictive context then the future spiritual communities will be built on distributed emergence, without the need for permanent leaders, authorities or denomination. This in fact mirrors the patterns we discussed in regards to the future of governance. In essence, religious organizations need to become more decentralized and distributed so that ideas of how the human spirit or consciousness relates to its existential condition can be expressed with less friction or distortion. This would allow different religious groups or identities to move past any theological divisions and find a common meaning or purpose for the twenty-first century that is more in-line with religion’s core drive which is to provide an outlet for people to explore their relationship to the unknown or unknowable.
>
> In this context religion can be revived by focusing on the very real dimension of problems for consciousness that have no final or complete answer but are rather fundamental mysteries of the historical process. Some of these very real dimensions include an understanding of universal ethics or morality, the structure of life and death, the design or construction or creation of the universe and the meaning of society and experience in a cosmic context. These dimensions of inquiry are as pressing for contemporary consciousness as they have ever been for consciousness. Thus the possibility for a revived understanding of spirituality and human relation to religion is now an informational potentiality which requires us to rethink a meaningful structure to information control." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

Thus, in the same way that a few people thinking in a new way about money and what to do with money due to the rise of new forms of industrial productive potential in the 19th century changed the socioeconomic conditions of the human world (i.e. universal subjective valuation of profit maximization via market exchange over and above all other values), we should again, simply, go back to the ‘micro-foundations’, think new forms of subjective valuation, and draw out their large-scale socioeconomic consequences, i.e. what would be the resulting ‘macro-foundations’ as ‘large-scale political collectives’ that developed due to new ‘micro-foundations’?" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom set out to articulate how the ‘state/market’ could be broken with a ‘radical third’ of a commons as ‘institutions for collective action’ with a specific focus on their establishment and management. In other words, instead of systems controlling property and labour (nation-states), or systems producing and consuming commodities (markets), the commons are systems for managing and distributing shared resources and spaces with a core of direct democracy (as opposed to representative democracy). For Ostrom, one of the key notions for the successful establishment and maintenance of a commons based on access is how these systems identify and properly manage ‘Common Pool Resources’ (CPR), which she identifies as resources and spaces that are inherently ‘common’ but also ‘scarce’ and thus ‘rival’. In other words, overcoming the problem of establishing and managing CPRs in a commons is the foundation for ‘de-commodification’ and ‘opening a commonwealth’, and perhaps, the key shift in transforming neoliberal institutions (and the multinational corporations that thrive under their reign) into commons institutions capable of establishing an automated and collaborative commons.
>
> In this frame a resource/space an be generally defined as a CPR if one agent/persons use of the resource/space will subtract from any other agent/persons use and where it is often necessary, but difficult and costly, to exclude another agent/persons use outside the group from using the resource/space. Here there are numerous and extremely diverse examples of such ‘rival/scarce’ resources/spaces that could be classified as a ‘CPR’: fishers, grazing grounds, parks, farms, transportation grids, and so forth. In Ostrom’s analysis of systems for collective action that benefit the common good (i.e. higher levels of cooperation) there are always simple yet fundamental problems related to (Ostrom 1990, p. 27):

> The first thing for GB theorists to note here is the difficulty in understanding and implementing the relation between the ‘local’ dimension and the ‘global’ dimension. In other words, although both the automated and collaborative functions of the commons would ideally fall within a universal medium that intelligently satisfied all human necessities - some form of ‘post- monetary’ ‘offer network’ (Goertzel 2015; Heylighen 2016b) - this universal medium must also be nested in order to meet CPR demands on multiple interacting levels, e.g. regional, continental, international and global. On the practical level there are functions of human civilization that operate on different levels of organization, e.g. regional health facilities require different commons demands than do international transportation networks or global environmental problems, etc. But on the second societal and cultural level there is the simple fact that real groups and communities exist at multiple levels with specific needs and desires that cannot be totally ignored and replaced with a totalizing and ideological abstract universalism (i.e. ‘We are all One world community, and so forth’). Thus, the point of Ostrom’s commons ‘design principles’ is that, although they complicate the situation of establishing and maintaining a commons, they are at the same time necessary preconditions for the commons long-term viability as well the growth of pluralism and diversity within a new universal level of organization." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Our civilization does not face a “black hole of intelligence” as the concept of technological singularity suggests. Instead, when properly framed in big historical terms I believe it is clear that we face the full emergence of a new evolutionary pathway: the true birth and independence of cultural evolution. As we covered when discussing cosmic evolution, networks of cultural symbols code for inner conceptual experience, outward conceptual behaviour, as well as for technological structures. This can be seen as analogous to the way that networks for chemicals code for inner perceptual experience, outward perceptual behaviour, as well as for biological structures. Consequently, the biocultural human lives in both a perceptual and a conceptual cognitive landscape, and the technologies we produce are an integral aspect to the cultural evolutionary process." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Cultural evolution is a new pathway, but it is a pathway that has not gained its own independence. Culture is dependent on biogenesis for its own existence and thus all of human evolution is a biocultural phenomenon. As mentioned, if symbolic systems manage to construct technological systems with biological properties (i.e. technological life), this would no longer be the case. The biocultural being would become a transitory stage between the worlds of the biochemical and the worlds of the technocultural." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "As the architects of the modern project realized, we are not quite biological animal, and we are not quite technologically divine: our existence is a dramatic temporal tension in the act of becoming something far beyond our imagination (i.e. beyond what we can currently represent with our symbolic structures or create with our technological structures). Thus my approach to a biocultural theory of human evolution is perhaps best described as explicitly modernist and ‘Nietzschean’ (Nietzsche 1883, p. 27): “Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman - a rope over an abyss.”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In my attempt at a holistic biocultural theory of human evolution, I consider myself as attempting to build upon the approach to cultural evolution that was stressed by the late anthropologist Leslie White (1949, p. xviii): “Culture may be considered a self-contained, self-determined process; one that can be explained only in terms of itself.” Only in terms of itself: this is to say that culture is not caused or determined by biological processes. Culture may currently depend on a particular genetic and neurological foundation, but it is its own emergent process, operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends. As mentioned, in biological evolution diversification does not lead to integration of the biological order itself. In contrast, as cultural evolution diversifies there does appear a direction towards an integration of the symbolic order itself (which is what I mean by “operating according to entirely different evolutionary ends”). Self-contained, self-determined process: this is to say that in order to support cultural evolution with symbolic inheritance and creation you must first have a high degree of self-reflexivity and self-awareness. In other words, aware mind(s) bridge the gap between the world of biological evolution and the world of cultural evolution, lifting life into a totally new domain of virtual creation and imagination (i.e. the self becomes aware of what is not (symbolic imagination), but also of what could be (symbolic representation)) (Frye 1947, p. 47): “We are fearfully and wonderfully made, but in terms of what our imaginations suggest we could be, we are a hideous botch…”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "“Atechnogenesis (AY-tech-noh-JEN-e-siss): a cultural process in cosmic evolution whereby symbolic information processing and reproduction transcends mindless design (natural selection) by developing a self-producing substrate of mind design.” In the same way that ‘abiogenesis’ means ‘biology arising from not-biology’, ‘atechnogenesis’ refers to a process whereby ‘technology arises from not-technology’. This may sound counter- intuitive at first but the whole of human evolution can be conceptualized as a gradual (yet accelerating) process where symbolically mediated mind was able to conjure technological structures out of ‘not-technology’. Every technology that has ever existed - from an Oldowan hand axe to the most advanced supercomputer - is an organization of atomic systems designed by an aware mind from constituent elements that were previously ordered or organized within a formerly geological, chemical or biological physical structure. This is to say that the emergence of any technology is a symbolic process where mind creates technological organization out of ‘not-technology’." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The most important shift in the process is a shift towards a world where the existential substrate switches its design mechanism: from the mechanism of what has traditionally been called ‘natural selection’ towards a mechanism that has/can be called many things, i.e. ‘intentional’, ‘purposeful’, ‘aware’, ‘cultural’, ‘mind’ selection. I am less interested in what this mechanism is called and more interested in the fact that this cognitive selection process is driven by self- reflexivity and self-awareness enabling biocultural humans to direct their own evolution with cultural symbols; is laden with internal meaning, intention and purpose; and could eventually culminate with an existential substrate that reflects this mind-driven symbolic ability (i.e. the world as the human mind wants to see it). Consequently, if the process of atechnogenesis reaches its completion and the age of technogenesis commences, the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate (e.g. carbon, silicon) will be less important than the fact that the material composition of humanity’s existential substrate will be purposefully and intentionally designed." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

In contrast, with the concepts of atechnogenesis, technogenesis and technoculture we are confronted with a new evolutionary pathway, a pathway fundamentally (1) directed by aware minds, (2) mediated through symbolic-linguistic codes, and (3) built upon a self-designed substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The combination of higher energy flow, information processing, cultural differentiation and sociopolitical integration could create the foundations for an emergent organization with a far higher possibility space than any historical society. This shift will include a qualitative leap in all of the dimensions of our personal lives, including how we relate to our own mind and life, how we relate to the world, and how we relate to each other (not to mention who we call ‘we’) (Hofstadter 2003). Historically, these dimensions of our experience have been shaped by our evolved biological perceptions, the replication of our symbolic structures, and the sociopolitical structures of historical civilization. However, in a technocultural world the mechanisms for sensory perception, replication of symbolic structures and sociopolitical organization will all have foundationally changed, likely leading towards a planetary network of unprecedented cultural and technological creation: tens of billions of minds in free association, exploring deeper levels of interconnection, and internal/external reflection than possible within a purely biological substrate." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "Many have stated that this potential ‘end of death’ could lead to the ‘death of meaning’. As far as we know a horizon of meaning constitutes itself against an anti-background of nothingness or death. Throughout the entirety of human life history the game of life has been the game of generation and death after generation of death. Being are ‘thrown’ (Heidegger 1962) into existence, struggle to make sense of their existence (search for meaning), and then fall out of existence. The human being added conceptual awareness to the struggle. Human civilization added collective learning to the struggle. Humans individually and humanity collectively create or participate in ‘immortal cultures’ and ‘make history’. In some psychoanalytic theories this participatory act in culture can be interpreted as a traumatic repression of our irreducible mortality and finitude (Brown 1959, p. 101). This drive against death means that humans are not ‘simply’ mortal and finite entities but rather mortal and finite entities ‘pathologized’ by desires for immortality and infinity (Freud 1920; Zupančič 2000). Dealing with the conceptual awareness of this paradoxical existential matrix of mortality-immortality, finitude-infinity, has thus also been hypothesized as both a motivation of civilization action (Cave 2012), and a constitutive problem of civilization action (Zupančič 2017). How do we human beings use our sexual and creative energy in light of the fact that we all going to die and return to non-being/nothingness? How would we use our sexual and creative energy if we were involved in an endless process of becoming? We can frame this internal psychological tension as both an inspiration (i.e. an ‘inspired suffering’ of history (Frye 1970)), and something to be collectively overcome (Brown 1967, p. 53): “The conclusion of the whole matter - Blake: ‘We are in a world of Generation and death, and this world we must cast off.’”" - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

Of course the same goes for the other uniquely human cultural activities like sciences, poetry, philosophy, mathematics, music, etc. Thus in the past we have clear evidence that quantitative increases in brain capacity can lead to the radical emergence of new qualitative properties which then proceed to play a dominant causal role in future evolutionary processes. What new symbolic or mind properties will emerge from a further technological expansion of the neocortex and further evolution of language towards closer mind-to-mind communication? And what will emerge from the new ecosystems of purely technological mind?

> Technocultural beings will be able to share extraordinary high levels of information at the speed of light, and via much more reliable mechanisms, likely via direct mind connection with others and with our collective computer networks (i.e. our ‘digital twins’ or ‘personal AIs’) (Kurzweil 2014). That is to say that the (practically) instant transmission of information files (for example: books, movies, music, photographs etc.) could be transferred between minds directly and understood near-instantaneously. All minds would have a dramatically expanded understanding of acquired knowledge, allowing for an unprecedented level of ‘cultural ratcheting’ (Tennie et al. 2009) or ‘collective learning’ (Christian 2004). The generational barriers towards knowledge transfer may even by completely overcome. Beings would also be able to communicate vast reaches of their mind through virtual recreations of any and all varieties in mediums of expression that currently do not exist.

Unlike the centralized, tightly controlled systems imagined by AI theorists, this network functions like a complex adaptive system: a decentralized, selforganizing whole formed by an immense variety of interacting agents. This makes the overall system much more powerful, robust, and adaptive than a preprogrammed central processor that takes in information sequentially. As it adapts, this network learns from its experience by expanding and extending the most useful technologies, ideas, links, institutions, and agents, while setting aside and eventually forgetting the less useful ones. Moreover, it learns to ever better coordinate the activities of its components, by creating ever more direct and more powerful links between them. It thus increases its own intelligence.

> "The most successful attempt to date at organizing this knowledge is Wikipedia, the global encyclopedia that is being read, written and edited by millions of volunteers worldwide. The basis of its success is [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a mechanism of self-organizing coordination between independent agents. The principle is that the work of one individual (e.g. an edit of a Wikipedia text) leaves a public trace (e.g. a change in the corresponding web page) that can stimulate one or more other individuals to continue the work (e.g. add further details or correct wrong assumptions). Thus, independent contributions build further the one on top of the other, producing a collective result much richer and more complex than could have been achieved via any traditional, centralized form of organization. There are no obvious limits to such a self-amplifying process of contributions eliciting further contributions." - [Return to Eden?

> "An essential part of that knowledge will be about the superorganism as a whole: how does the world function, and what opportunities and dangers can we anticipate? This requires, first, a general, transdisciplinary theory of complex systems and their networks of interactions: a global systems science. This theory would then be implemented as a living earth simulator: a comprehensive computer model of global society, the planetary ecosystem, and the way they interact. Such a simulation would allow us to anticipate the effects of different events or interventions on the global superorganism. That would make it possible to formulate a nearly optimal trajectory for global development, while as much as possible steering clear of conceivable obstacles, catastrophes, and negative side effects. However, in order to remain up to date and to adapt to unforeseen disturbances, this model would need to be constantly fed with new data. Moreover, it should be able to test out its hypotheses in the real world, so as to correct possibly inaccurate assumptions. A we noted earlier, this would require a very high-bandwidth interaction network, which Helbing call a planetary nervous system." - [Return to Eden?

These are “Human Metasystem Transitions” (HMST). Throughout these HMST several common system-level patterns have manifested that are fundamental to understanding the nature and evolution of the human system, as well as our potential future development. First, HMST have been built around the control of three mostly distinct primary energy sources (e.g., hunting, agriculture, industry). Second, the control of new energy sources has always been achieved and stabilized by utilizing the evolutionary emergence of a more powerful information-processing medium (e.g., language, writing, printing press)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

The highest metasystem controls display an ever-broader extension of control over larger regions of space, and they can accomplish this spatial feat in shorter durations of time (i.e., physical space-time barriers to human action are consistently and progressively reduced). Consequently, there is a trend toward accelerated metasystem emergence, as the space-time reach of human action progressively increases. The hunting transition occurred over a period of hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, the agricultural transition occurred over a period of thousands of years, and the industrial transition has been occurring over a period of centuries. This metasystem process has resulted in more complex human organizations directly and coherently controlling more of the Earth’s surface, faster. For individuals, the consequence is the emergence of systems that increasingly allow for action that is global (spatial) and instant (temporal). Therefore, in regards to both space and time, higher metasystem controls appear to facilitate a culturally and technologically mediated conquest of dimensionality." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

Turchin spends quite some effort defending his views against any associations with the totalitarianism he knows so well, by emphasizing again and again the essential role of freedom and creativity. The rejection of control systems at the social level is more than a superficial emotional reaction to the negative connotations of the word “control”, though." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

It is intuitively obvious that if subsystems collaborate systematically in achieving a goal, they will be more effective than if they would behave anarchistically, without plan or co-ordination. The presently fashionable argument that no overarching plan is needed, since interacting actors will self-organize into stable and efficient patterns of interaction (the “invisible hand” of market forces), does not invalidate this proposition. The spontaneous ordering of a market is the result of complex communications and negotiations that lead to an overall co-ordination and constraint of the different actors’ behaviors. Once a perfectly competitive market has reached equilibrium, no participating actor is able to set prices that significantly diverge from those resulting from supply and demand requirements without being eliminated from the scene (“going broke”). One can debate whether the resulting economic order controls the actions of the participating actors, but it certainly constrains them." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

This is the classical "free-rider" problem: everyone benefits from a public transport system funded by individual contributions, but the one who does not pay benefits most. Since evolution never stops, variation will sooner or later produce "free riders" in an otherwise optimized social system, and it is the latter that will be selected, not the earnest cooperators, resulting in the erosion and eventual collapse of the cooperative system." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

This includes human populations. Yet human groups present some of the most extensive cooperative systems, comparable only to the social insects. This can be explained by assuming shared controls additional to the genetic one. Though we will discuss different types of control mechanisms in a later section, the most typically human mechanism can be found in culture: knowledge or beliefs shared between individuals through communication. A belief, piece of knowledge or pattern of behavior that is transmitted from one individual to another one can be said to replicate. In analogy to genes, such cultural replicators can be called "memes"." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "The most productive way to cooperate entails division of labor, each individual focusing on a different subtask while contributing to a common goal. Such independent action is not only easier because it requires less coordination and exchange of information, it is potentially also much more productive because of synergetic complementarity. If different individuals focus on gathering different resources, they will not only be able to avoid the fitness reducing effects of direct competition and arms races, they may even be able to directly enhance each other's fitness by exchanging surplus resources, like in the symbiotic relationship between alga and fungus. For example, in primitive tribes, one part of the population might focus on gathering fruit, while another part might focus on hunting. This will allow each of the two subgroups to develop greater expertise in their domain of specialization, and thus greater efficiency in collecting resources. The more differentiated the specialization becomes, the larger the domain of resources that can be explored by the collective." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

However, the development of a shared control, which restricts independent evolution on the individual level, provides a possible mechanism for overcoming this obstacle. Once some type of control is established, differentiation of roles within the social system is facilitated. In accordance with Turchin's "law of the branching growth of the penultimate level", increasing differentiation increases the selective pressure for developing social controls, which in turn feed back into increasing differentiation. This process in essence constitutes a social metasystem transition." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

At each level, there is not only competition between other groupings at the same level, but also competition between the interests of the smaller incorporated units and the interests of the larger encompassing unit. Primary, face-to-face, groups are incorporated into organized city-states, and these into nations. A plausible node of selection and inter-organization competition can be envisaged at each of these levels. Our skepticism towards Turchin's prediction about the inevitable organizing of nations into a single world government comes from the lack of any obvious node of selection at the whole-world, multinational level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

The solution was to limit group selection to non-biological cultural evolution and to see self-sacrificial altruism as a result of cultural group selection of ideologies, social-organizational traditions, moral indoctrination, and religious cosmologies. This point of view had many plausible implications, among them an explanation of why moral commandments and lists of deadly sins contain explicit rejections of innate human nature. There is also the obvious group-coordination utility of beliefs in rewarding and punishing afterlives and reincarnations, which extend perceived self-interest into an afterlife and thus can promote self-sacrificial acts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Individuals with deviating beliefs or patterns of behavior can be held in check by different forms of ostracism or "moralistic aggression". If they are not convinced by the ever repeated messages transmitted by the other members of the group, the other members can simply force them to obey the rules, by punishing them as soon as a transgression is witnessed. This is a form of mutual monitoring. It implements the reciprocity of cooperation that is also found in "tit-for-tat"-like strategies. Conformist transmission and mutual monitoring together produce a sufficiently strong shared control to allow the evolution of extensive cooperation in small groups with close contacts: primary or "face-to-face-groups". However, when groups become so large that not all members are in direct contact with each other, it becomes difficult to maintain an overall shared control. Without reciprocal monitoring, deviant behaviors get a chance to develop. This can be controlled by two additional mechanisms: 1) by making the belief so strong that it controls behavior even in the absence of other group members reinforcing it (internalized restraint); 2) by developing specialized subgroups (e.g. police, militia, the judiciary) whose task it is to monitor and enforce the following of rules (legal control)." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

From the different social control mechanisms it is the one that most strongly resembles the traditional concept of control as exerted by a separate, centralized, hierarchically superior system, that tries to reach an explicitly formulated goal by rewarding actions that contribute to reaching that goal, while punishing those that produce deviations. As a pure form, without mutual monitoring and internalized restraint, legal control requires an unaffordably large specialist corps to enforce it: you cannot put a policeman next to every citizen." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

But law in its effort to achieve universality and fairness must pretend that words have situation-free, formal meanings, denying their indexicality. Written and interpreted 'literally', the wordings allow loopholes and unintended uses never envisaged in their construction. The result is that in modern states, such as the present-day USA, enormous amounts of money and effort are invested in lawyers and legal research, just in order to try to interpret the rules in one's proper interest. The only possible countermeasure seems to consist in making legal formulations ever more formal, precise and explicit, anticipating ever wider ranges of particular conditions. The net result is that law seems to get ever more complex and difficult to manage." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "A fourth type of social control, market mechanisms, can again to some degree compensate the shortcomings of legal control, internal restraint and mutual monitoring. In market processes the intelligently selfish choices of all group members together curb the greed of single individuals, by making it unprofitable to ask for more than a "fair share". Similar to mutual monitoring, market mechanisms operate locally. This means they do not require an independent, centralized control organ, like legal control does. This makes them more tolerant and flexible, adapting quickly to new contexts or developments, but less reliable, and more prone to vicious cycles induced by small variations magnified by positive feedback ("boom and bust").
>
> Market mechanisms are quite efficient in the allocation of the factors of production (natural resources, labor, capital). Their main function is to regulate the diversification of effort resulting from division of labor. Markets create an equilibrium between supply and demand of goods or resources by adjusting prices (which are a consensual measure for the average value of a good). This ensures that when a particular good or service is in demand, there will quickly develop a sufficiently large group of individuals or firms specialised in providing it to meet that demand. Complementarily, when demand diminishes or supply increases (e.g. because of more efficient technologies), the effort invested in providing these goods will be quickly adjusted downwards, making more effort available for meeting other needs.
>
> The general mechanism is a negative feedback cycle where increase in supply via decrease in demand produces again a decrease in supply. Thus, large fluctuations are damped, and prices tend to stay around an equilibrium value. Although the negative feedback loop is the basis for cybernetic control, it is not sufficient on its own to create a control system. As Powers (1973) notes, cybernetic control requires amplification of the corrective reaction with respect to the initial perturbation: an increase in supply/demand above the reference level should produce a counteraction decreasing supply/demand more quickly than the initial deviation. Such a system very soon reaches a fixed reference or equilibrium state, from which it is very difficult to make it deviate. Market feedback, on the other hand, tends to be smaller than the fluctuation that caused it: after the demand goes up, it will go down again, but in general not so much as to reach its original level. Thus, the "equilibrium" value will slowly move, adjusting to outside conditions, which depend on the availability of resources, and the intrinsic needs of the public. It is this absence of an explicit norm or reference value that distinguishes market "control" from the other social control mechanisms, where religious values, moral and social rules, and laws provide the fixed reference against which behavior is evaluated. The variability of market feedback allows adaptation to new circumstances while still buffering the system against wild fluctuations.
>
> However, the concurrent danger is that when there is no stable underlying need or fixed store of exhaustible resources, feedback may become positive, leading to run-away processes. A traditional example is speculation, where an increasing demand makes people anticipate even higher prices, and thus gains for goods or assets bought now and sold later. Another example is technological development, where increased adoption of an innovative technological product (say an airplane or computer system) diminishes the costs needed to produce further units, and encourages the public to use that technology, rather than less well-spread competing designs. Thus, increase of supply leads to both further increases of supply and increases of demand ("increasing returns", see Arthur, 1988).
>
> Libertarian theorists and [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) economists recommend using market mechanisms as the overall control, while avoiding all centralized interventions except for the protection of private property and inherited wealth. Yet, we believe that market mechanisms cannot operate effectively without the contribution of the other social control mechanisms. The building block of market processes is the transaction, in which one good or service is traded for another one (or its proxy, money). A transaction is basically a "Prisoner's Dilemma" type of interaction, in which there is a short term benefit in defecting, i.e. profiting from the other party's investment without fulfilling one's own part of the deal. (For example one might refuse to pay for a service, or pay with counterfeited bank notes, or supply a defective good). It is just to counteract such tendency to defection that mutual monitoring, internal restraint and legal control have evolved. In particular, legal control is needed to ensure that contracts are fulfilled, and that goods are not captured through violence rather than trade. On a different level, legal control is necessary to ensure that positive feedback loops do not get out of hand, and that investments are made in areas where the lack of local or short term benefits precludes private investment.
>
> In a similar vein, Mancur Olson (1968) employs the tools of mainstream economics which are characterized by the hope that an "invisible hand" emerging from competition will provide the restraints needed for collective action. But he shows that from basic economic assumptions it follows that if each person is intelligently selfish in choices, "collective goods", including the benefits of cooperation, will be lost. (This agrees with Hardin's (1968) analysis of the “Tragedy of the Commons”, where competition exhausts the common resources.) He concludes that to solve "free-rider" problems some form of compulsion is needed.
>
> As an additional argument, we may remember that competition between similar systems tends to lead to arms races which decrease absolute fitness. For example, two companies producing essentially similar products (e.g. soft drinks) by similar methods and selling them for similar prices can only hope to increase their market share by spending more and more on publicity. This may lead to situations where more than half of the product's price is made up by the cost of advertisements, trying to convince the customer that one's product is better than the competitor's product. Market competition will in general only produce a positive sum if there is a differentiation in resource usage and production methods between the competitors, but, as we discussed, when the initial differences are too small, competition will hinder rather than stimulate further differentiation. E.g. when a particular way of producing soft drinks is well established it is quite risky for an existing company to distinguish itself from its competitors by promoting a new recipe: the chances are higher that it will lose customers used to a particular taste than that it will make new converts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "A complex society like ours, characterized by a full division of labor, seems to require the presence of at least the four social control mechanisms outlined above. Each of these mechanisms functions at a different level of interaction. Internal restraint functions at the level of the single individual. Mutual monitoring functions between pairs (one to one) or small groups. Legal control is directed from an individual or small group to the whole (one to many)—and, if the controlling body is democratically elected, the other way around (many to one). Market equilibria emerge from interactions between all members of the group (many to many).
>
> Of these, only legal control can (arguably) be fitted into the classical, hierarchical control paradigm. This may explain Powers’s (1980) reluctance to recognize any kind of control at the social level. Yet, all these control mechanisms can be viewed as social constraints, curbing and modifying the selfish and nepotistic goals that control individual actions. They are thus working at the metasystem level (as defined in Heylighen, this issue).
>
> In spite of their sometimes wide-ranging and subtle effects it is obvious that the mixture of control mechanisms we see in our present society is far from optimal. What is most obviously lacking is any form of integration between these mechanisms. It is easy to imagine situations where the restrictions imposed by the different mechanisms are mutually inconsistent, religious tradition demanding one type of behavior, law another one, the market a third one, and peer pressure a fourth one. Moreover, each control mechanism on its own lacks an invariant focus: mutual monitoring varies with the local group of peers, legal control and internal restraint with national, organizational and religious frameworks, and market pressure with the vagaries of interacting positive and negative feedbacks, as exemplified by the chaotic movements of quotations at the stock exchange. Thus, in spite of the metalevel at which these mechanisms function it is as yet hard to recognize in society any integrated metasystem. The task of thinking through the problems of social control that are created by the on-going competition between the cooperators is merely starting." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

In considering the episodes of scientific fraud that have come to light in recent years, face-to-face-group solidarity processes are relevant in two ways. On the one hand, they explain the cruel ostracism that whistle-blowers experience when they call attention to defects that would undermine "truth," organizational goals, or national goals. On the other hand, most discoveries of fraud are due to the mutual monitoring of fellow workers in the face-to- face laboratories. A sociology of scientific validity might recommend both increased opportunity for mutual monitoring in laboratories, and a restructuring of perceived legitimacy so that whistle-blowing (or an earlier-stage substitute for it) was not stigmatized as disloyalty or interpersonal hostility, but rather routinized as always required minority reports." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Evolution, both cultural and biological, has produced organization-optimizing (group-solidarity) mechanisms which are optimal in intergroup conflict and hence work against whole-world organizational optimizing. LeVine and Campbell found that Sumner's principle, "the exigencies of war with outsiders are what make peace inside" or "real threat causes ingroup solidarity," was the most frequently endorsed or independently invented of all of the principles of intergroup conflict. If there is a "facultative polymorphism" for group vs. individual optimization, the threat of outgroup aggression is no doubt a powerful stimulus for group-optimizing behaviors. Such perceptions are open to manipulation by insecure national leaders and by their competitors for leadership, and such maneuvers are chronic saboteurs of intergroup peace. In proposing novel political arrangements, here is perhaps the greatest need for new arrangements and legitimacies. Perhaps the route could be through popular education as to these self-destructive mechanisms, plus a plausible design for world government which could offer the hope of righting injustices without war, plus a strong appeal to the motives of individual well-being and inclusive fitness done in such a manner as to not disrupt social coordination at sub-national levels of organization.

This applies over the whole spectrum, from the smallest units, families (that are strongly tied up by the genetically induced tendency to nepotism) and face-to-face groups (e.g. colleagues working in the same office space), to the largest (e.g. nations or groups of nations, such as the European Union, and the overarching religions or ideologies, such as the group of all Muslims). The fact that all these different fuzzily defined groups are nested or overlapping creates an extremely complicated picture, in which the same two individuals will either compete or cooperate, depending on the level at which their interaction takes places. This makes it extremely difficult to predict the further evolution of a complex society such as ours.

> The strongest influence for the future is perhaps the emergence of ever more powerful and better integrated communication media, as exemplified by the explosive development of electronic networks such as the World-Wide Web. This makes it in principle possible for fit beliefs (memes) to spread quickly over the entire globe with minimal distortion. If beneficial beliefs thus manage to get shared world-wide, they may initialize a global pattern of cooperation. More specialized global control knowledge may similarly be developed and maintained within an overarching computer network (Heylighen, 1996), whose ubiquitousness, flexibility and intrinsic intelligence may be able to overcome the rigidities of bureaucratic organization and legal control, and the short-sightedness of market mechanisms. Nobody can predict how, when, or even whether, such global integration will take place.

> "A "social" MST can be seen as the emergence of an integrated, controlled supersystem out of similar, but initially independent control systems ("individuals"). It thus differs from others MST's discussed by Turchin, such as the emergence of movement, learning or rational thought, where the systems to be integrated (neurons, muscles, cognitive patterns, ...) either are not similar or are already dependent on an integrated organism. This difference is what makes social MST's problematic. We have seen that since individuals share common resources, yet independently maximize their outcomes, they tend to get engaged in negative sum competition. Positive sum, cooperative arrangements, which optimize the fitness of the group as a whole, normally get eroded by this competition. Thus, the part-whole competition between groups and individuals tends to be won by the individual level. A social metasystem would overcome this negative sum development by simultaneously differentiating individual's roles (division of labor), and restraining their selfish optimizing (social control), thus creating the conditions for positive sum synergy. However, a necessary condition for such metasystem to evolve is a shift from selection of individuals to selection of groups. We have discussed one mechanism that makes this possible: the development of controls (genetic or learned) that are shared between members of a group. Shared genetic controls are characteristic of the cells in an organism and the individual insects in an ant's nest or beehive. They thus may explain the well-integrated social metasystems found in multicellular organisms and insect societies.
>
> In human societies, on the other hand, competition at the genetic level continues, though group selection may have developed a genetic basis for certain innate social control mechanisms, like reciprocal altruism and moralistic aggression. This makes humans into profoundly ambivalent social animals. The predominant shared control for humans is cultural: beliefs spread through conformist transmission. However, the conformist mechanisms that keep beliefs similar are not sufficiently strong to keep context-dependence and communicative degradation from producing a continuous belief divergence or "memetic drift". Thus, human society becomes a patchwork of fuzzily defined groups at different levels of aggregation, characterized by clique selfishness and hostility towards competing groups. Different control mechanisms have evolved to complement the limited internalized restraint produced by shared beliefs: mutual monitoring, legal control and market mechanisms. However, each of these mechanisms has its intrinsic shortcomings, and as a whole they are characterized by inconsistency and lack of integration. Though there certainly exist methods and tools that may make social organization more effective, which must be examined urgently, we as yet do not see a straightforward path to social integration at the world level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "The main applications of the Internet are likely to become integrated into a single, universal system for coordinating all the activities of the people and machines on this planet. Such a system would immensely reduce the confusion, friction and waste caused by poorly aligned activities, while boosting the synergy of collaboration. Complemented by on-going technological innovation, the resulting increase in productivity would create an economy of abundance, where all needs can be satisfied at negligible costs. The combination of abundance with an intelligent, bottom-up system of coordination should eventually produce a solution for all the major problems that plague humanity, including global warming, poverty, inequality and conflict. This utopian but realizable scenario for the mid-term future has been called “return to Eden”." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Society is an autonomous system: it is able to survive and grow by solving the problems or exploiting the opportunities that it encounters—and this without need for outside direction. It recognizes such challenges through its (largely implicit) value system, which evaluates certain conditions as beneficial (e.g. education, shelter, drinkable water, peace, …) and others as harmful (e.g. hurricanes, pollution, crime, disease, …) to its development. It tackles these challenges by analyzing and interpreting the situation, and by initiating actions to deal with it (e.g. purifying water, building houses, curing people from disease, preventing crime, …). This means that society possesses an implicit store of knowledge and an intelligence that applies that knowledge by making the necessary inferences and eventually reaching decisions about the actions to take. This intelligence is not localized in a central executive, such as a king or government, that would command and control the social system. It is rather distributed over billions of individuals, organizations, networks, documents containing specialized knowledge and regulations, computer programs, and machines that perform actions. Thus, the intelligence of society is similar to the one inherent in the brain (Minsky, 1988), where knowledge and inference processes are distributed across billions of neurons and their connecting synapses." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

This ignores the desires of agents that lack money, or their desires for things that cannot be bought—such as friendship, clean air, or democracy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The process of coordination between all the offers and demands that exist in the world remains highly inefficient. This creates a selective pressure for the development of a universal coordination protocol that would interconnect and eventually absorb or replace all existing sharing platforms—just like the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol did with all preceding computer networks. Thus, such a protocol would eliminate all the intermediaries, enabling immediate peer-to-peer transactions via an open, free, public medium. Such a medium for synergetic interaction would provide the foundation for what has been called the “collaborative commons” or “automated commons”, i.e. a vast virtual space in which anyone can share anything. This would completely change the rules of the present economy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In spite of its flexibility and apparent universality, a money-based, capitalist economy has a number of well-known shortcomings. Most generally, money or price as a onedimensional variable is much too coarse to express how various offers and demands differ in value according to multiple criteria—such as size, ease of use, beauty, sustainability, or social impact. In particular, there are fundamental values—such as happiness, love, or clean air— that intrinsically do not have a price, because they cannot be transferred from person to person and therefore have no exchange value. Moreover, human psychology does not treat value or preference as what mathematicians call a total order, but as a partial order: some things cannot be unambiguously ordered according to their value; in some contexts we prefer the one, in other contexts the other. Therefore, value can in general not be reduced to a universal, one-dimensional quantity." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There is another fundamental shortcoming of money. Because it can be exchanged for about any good or service, it is in practice the most powerful resource to possess. Moreover, its power increases proportionally to the amount you have: with double the amount of money, you can buy double the amount of things. Its linear, numerical character further means that it can be  accumulated unrestrictedly without losing any value. In this it is different from most other values, such as food, shelter or rest, which are subjected to diminishing returns: once you have had enough, you do not benefit by getting more. This has turned money into the dominant value of our society. Thus it has pushed aside values such as sustainability, community, happiness, or wisdom that are more fundamental, but more difficult to quantify or to accumulate. As a result, for many people money has become its own reward—rather than a means to a more basic end such as well-being, self-actualization, or social harmony.
>
> The dynamics of accumulation moreover leads to inequality, according to the wellknown positive feedback of the rich getting richer: the more money you have, the easier it is to invest surplus money in property, stocks or innovations that will get you even more money. This leads to the concentration of wealth in an ever-smaller group. An unfortunately common side effect is the poor getting poorer: the less money you have, the more difficult it is to invest in any business or form of self-development, such as education or health care, that would increase your income. What is worse, you will also have more difficulty to pay your general cost of living, and to find the resources, time or energy to tackle any unexpected problem that may occur. This makes it likely that you end up in a spiral of accumulating debt and the concomitant poverty.
>
> This [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) is boosted by globalization and the Internet: the easier movement of money, goods and information increases the reach of the most successful, thus increasing their profit, while reducing the profit of the less successful—even when the things they offer are virtually identical. The positive feedback of the Matthew effect in a sense negates the negative feedback of the invisible hand, where increase of demand is supposed to increase supply and thus again decrease demand. People who fall into poverty, e.g. because of illness, unemployment or debt, actually have a greater need for things like medical care, accommodation, and transport than people who live comfortably in their own home from the interests on their savings. But that demand is ignored by the invisible hand because poor people have no money to pay for the things they need. Therefore, as their situation worsens because they do not get what they need, their real demand increases rather than decreases.
>
> Another form of positive feedback is produced by speculation, which is a demand for things that are bought not for their intrinsic worth, but for the sole reason that they are expected to increase in price. Thus, increasing demand can lead to an expectation of prices increasing further and therefore to even higher demand. This vicious cycle produces the bubbles, booms and busts typical of a capitalist economy, and the concomitant market volatility and economic crises. This instability too is amplified by the easier movement of capital across the Internet.
>
> In sum, while money appears like a simple and flexible medium for matching offer and demand, in practice it produces a strongly distorted picture of the actual demand, ignoring many fundamental needs and values of society, while creating speculative demand for things that are not intrinsically valuable. Thus, it amplifies minor differences into growing inequality and instability." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In a small enough community everybody knows everybody, so that the community members have a good idea of who has given what and who has received what. People who give more than they receive gain prestige or reputation. On the other hand, people who take out more than they put in lose reputation. People with high reputation are more likely to receive what they want if they express a demand. This motivates them to increase their reputation further by giving more. On the other hand, if someone’s reputation would drop beneath a certain level, then people would stop giving anything, thus effectively excluding that person from the community and its benefits. This is an effective measure against free riders. Still, the needy—such as children, old or ill people—will not suffer loss of reputation even if they cannot reciprocate, because the community knows that they are not willfully abusing the system, and have made or will make contributions in other periods of their life.
>
> Such a gift economy can only work in a small community where there is a sufficient collective knowledge of people’s overall needs and contributions to keep the exchanges approximately in balance. This ability to survey the whole system—which Jean-François Noubel has called “holopticism”—enables a form of distributed intelligence that flexibly coordinates offer and demand. Our present global economy is much too complex for any individual or group to acquire such an overview of all the exchanges that occur. Nevertheless, thanks to the power of ICT the holoptic and balancing functions can be delegated to the emerging Global Brain, using the kind of production system algorithms we have discussed.
>
> To make this practically feasible we need to implement two additional features of a gift economy. First, we need the equivalent of a reputation system, which keeps track of the aggregate quality and quantity of the offers that each individual has made through the offer network, increasing that person’s reputation proportionally, while reducing it whenever the individual is observed to abuse the offer network. Computer-supported reputation systems have proven to be very effective in keeping vendors honest and constructive in online marketplaces and in motivating volunteers to make highquality contributions to open collaboration networks. While it will not be a trivial exercise to extend such systems to the level of a global offer network, it is likely that this will eventually happen through the same “disintermediation” dynamics that we have repeatedly encountered, in which local, mutually incompatible systems are eventually subsumed into a universal coordination protocol." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There are a range of other motives that can stimulate people to act towards the common good, including altruism, curiosity, desire for feedback, and sheer enthusiasm for a particular cause (Heylighen, 2007b). With the help of a user-friendly, “gamified” interface and the social-psychological mechanisms of reputation, flow and [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a smart ICT system can stimulate and coordinate such motivations so as to produce effective collective action. This would turn the offer network into a mobilization system. That means that it would not only match existing offers and demands, but also elicit new offers for anything for which there is an unfulfilled need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The traditional solution to this problem is for the government to tax negative externalities, such as pollution, and subsidize positive externalities, such as education—thus  making globally beneficial transactions more attractive. The difficulty with this approach is that estimating the overall external impact of anything is extremely complex and situation-dependent, as it involves an unlimited number of known and potential effects and side effects. Taxation, on the other hand, needs to follow a set of simple rules, formalized as laws, that are set by a central authority. This only allows a coarse and rigid correction that is unable to adapt to the subtleties of a complex situation. Another difficulty is that the most important, long-term externalities, such as climate change or loss of biodiversity, are global, whereas the authority of governments is national and their outlook short-term. Therefore, governments typically have neither the power nor the political will to efficiently regulate such global externalities.
>
> How could a global offer network deal with externalities? One advantage of an offer network is that it does not reduce demand to an aggregate of discrete transactions in which one party is willing to pay money to one other party in order to obtain some specific good or service. Demand should rather be seen as a collective preference for certain outcomes rather than other ones. This includes demands for non-monetizable values such as clean air, biodiversity, peace, or freedom. An intelligent, “holoptic” offer network should in principle be able to track to what degree individual or collective agents contribute to satisfying such demands. Agents that add to the most important values would be rewarded by a general increase in reputation, and therefore in their ability to satisfy their own demands. Agents that contribute negatively to values would be penalized by a loss of reputation, and therefore a loss in their ability to produce further harm. Thus, the network as a whole would motivate agents to seek positive externalities and avoid negative ones.
>
> This mechanism already plays to some degree at the global level. For example, firms that are seen to participate in rain forest destruction or exploitation of low-wage laborers lose reputation and therefore potential income from clients who would rather buy from more conscientious competitors. Vice-versa, organizations that contribute to the global good, e.g. by building schools in poor African villages, gain in reputation and are rewarded with donations and volunteer work. At the moment, this propagation of reputation still happens via the intermediary of NGOs, government institutes or specialized groups, such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace or Unesco. These monitor otherwise obscure external effects, and use the mass media and the Internet to broadcast their observations so as to expand people’s awareness of the global situation.
>
> Because of the general disintermediation dynamics, it is likely that this monitoring and propagation of “external” reputation will become increasingly integrated with the universal protocols of the Global Brain. This means in particular that there would no longer be any independent authority, such as a government, NGO, or UN organization, to decide what is good or bad for society. Instead, the different “authorities” would themselves be subjected to the same kind of reputation mechanisms as individual agents. This makes it possible to compute a global reputation as an aggregate of evaluations by individual and organizational agents, weighted by their respective reputation scores. Such an aggregate reputation can be determined in an intelligent manner through the propagation of trust weights in a social  network, using an equivalent of the PageRank algorithm. The result would be a distributed measure of trust or authority that would be more balanced, more diverse in its outlook, and less easily corruptible than any central authority (such as a government) in estimating to what degree the overall effects of an action would be positive or negative." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "A long-term effect of externalities is that they can make the system unsustainable, either by the accumulation of waste or pollution, or the exhaustion of non-renewable resources. A money-based economy can to some degree deal with the exploitation of scarce resources via the price mechanism: as a resource becomes scarcer, its price increases; therefore more effort will be done to save it, or to replace it by a more abundant resource. However, since waste does not have a price, it is ignored by the “invisible hand”, and therefore the market has no incentive to reduce it. Taxing waste or pollution is a traditional way of reducing this problem.
>
> However, an offer network can do better, by considering waste as an unconditional offer entered into the system. The network’s coordination algorithms would not only try to maximize the satisfaction of demands (“backward chaining”), but also the exploitation of offers (“forward chaining”). That means that they should search to match this offer of “waste” with some sequence of production rules that may convert it into something for which there is a demand. For example, the grape seeds that are a waste product from wine making can be transformed into grape seed oil, which in turn can be used for the production of food, while plastic from packaging can be reconverted to produce inexpensive park benches and toys.
>
> Thus, a well-balanced offer network should maximally recycle any “waste” that is produced as a side effect of satisfying demand. The realizability of full recycling is demonstrated by Chemical Organization Theory, a mathematical formalism based on “reactions” similar to the ones we described as production rules. The theory shows that a network of reactions tends to selforganize into a self-sustaining subnetwork, where everything that is consumed is also produced, and vice versa. The algorithms supporting an intelligent offer network should help us to find such self-sustaining system of cycles more quickly and efficiently." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Another global challenge that offer networks may be able to tackle is resilience. Complex networks of interdependencies are vulnerable to cascading failures: whenever part of the network is damaged by some unforeseen perturbation (e.g. an earthquake, a bankruptcy, an electricity overload, a computer virus) this problem may start to propagate through the network more quickly than it can be contained, until the network as a whole breaks down. This is for example what happened with  several large-scale electricity blackouts and with the 2008 financial collapse. A system is resilient if it can recover from perturbations before it is irreversibly damaged. Strategies to achieve resilience include:
>
> • preventing the positive feedbacks that make local disturbances cascade into global problems;
>
> • increasing the diversity of the components of the system, so that a problem affecting one is unlikely to affect others;
>
> • increasing redundancy, so that there are sufficient components to take over the function of those that were damaged; and
>
> • accurately monitoring (potential) problems so that they can be remedied before they get out of hand.
>
> All of these strategies are supported by offer networks. The envisaged surplus of offers creates a buffer against potential scarcity. The great diversity of available offers and methods to connect offers and demands provides sufficient redundancy so that demands can be satisfied even when the traditional supply routes are disrupted. This is similar to how the TCP/IP protocol made the Internet more resilient than rival networks, by providing a wide variety of alternative routes for retransmitting information packets that get lost. Moreover, the offer network would create a fine-grained map of the different needs the moment they appear, while providing intelligent algorithms that mobilize and route offers immediately to the place where the need is highest. Finally, because it does not rely on the accumulation of money, it prevents the positive feedbacks of speculation and the [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) that can lead to financial collapses and growing inequality." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

If I need something specific from the offer network, I should be able to formulate that need so that the network can recognize that it matches the offer that someone else has formulated. Natural language tends to be too ambiguous for the purpose, because words can have many meanings or just be too vague to express what I need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The role of a utopia is to create such a vision. Past utopias have been discredited mainly because their views were unrealistic: they failed to take into account the complexity of social systems and the tensions and contradictions inherent in human nature. As a result, their application to real societies have all too often produced spectacular failures. Yet, recent developments such as evolutionary psychology and the theory of complex adaptive systems, are providing fundamental insights in these complexities, opening up the perspective of a utopia that takes them duely into account. While a realistic model of a future society will necessarily be complex, abstract and with many shades of grey, a utopia must in the first place provide a simple and appealing picture, that people can easily visualize. These two requirements—of realistic complexity and of intuitive appeal—are inherently at odds, and therefore an acceptable utopia will have to be a compromise. In my own reflections on this issue, I have settled on the metaphor of the “global brain” for me as the most satisfactory vision of a positive, yet realistic future for humanity." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)

> "Division of labor is based on the principle that if individuals specialize in carrying out particular tasks, they can be more efficient. However, if an individual is exclusively busy producing one particular type of commodity or service, then that individual will be dependent on reciprocation by others for providing the other resources (s)he needs. Therefore, division of labor can only evolve on a solid basis of cooperation. But once the process has started, division of labor will spontaneously increase, driven by a positive feedback mechanism, as illustrated by Gaines's (1994) computer simulation: individuals who were successful in providing a particular type of service—because of opportunity, competence or simply accident—will get more requests for that type of service, and thus get the chance to develop a growing expertise in the domain. This in turn will increase the demand for their specific service, stimulating them to further specialize...

> The increasing division of labor entails an accompanying increase in mutual dependence and therefore cooperativity. Cooperativity could be defined positively as probability or dependability of cooperation, and negatively as lack of cheating or free riding.

> "The increasing division of labor leads to a differentiation of the system into ever more specialized subunits. The increasing dependency of these units on the rest of the system, to compensate for the capacities they lost through specialization, leads to increasing integration and cohesion. Differentiation and integration together produce complexification of the global system, and an ever greater independence from the environment. The positive feedback relation between integration and differentiation leads to the accelerated development of a complex organization out of an aggregate of initially similar components. This is a metasystem transition: the evolutionary emergence of a higher level of cybernetic organization. This overall dynamic is at the base of both the evolution of multicellular organisms out of similar cells and of societies out of individuals." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "In the longer term, gains in stability due to low-friction, negative feedback are likely to be maintained or amplified, while the loss of stability due to low-friction, positive feedbacks will increase the selective pressure for evolving new regulatory mechanisms. For example, the appearance of a circulatory system in multicellular organisms strongly reduced friction, making it much easier for nutrients and hormonal signals to travel through the body. This gave the organism better overall control over its dispersed tissues and organs, allowing it to become larger and more differentiated. The disadvantage was that microbes too could travel more efficiently. This was compensated by the evolution of white blood cells, allowing the immune functions to keep up with the flow. Similarly, the spread of computer viruses and other threats on the computer network might be stemmed by an artificial immune system, inspired by the mechanisms (such as self-other distinction) used by white blood cells to recognize intruders.
>
> More generally, the easier flow of goods, people and money in a globalizing society has led to new dangers, such as international crime syndicates, money laundering, and competition between countries that erodes wages, governments' capacities to collect taxes, and working standards. These can only be solved by the creation of global control mechanisms, such as transnational crime fighting agencies, rules for international bank transfers, and agreements on minimum social standards (e.g. restricting the import of goods made by child labor). The need to monitor and control such problems is at the base of the increasing importance of global institutions, such as WTO, IMF, World Bank, WHO, and UN. Thus, if short-term catastrophes can be avoided, reduction of friction will further enhance the robustness of societal autopoiesis.
>
> A more subtle effect of reduced friction is the lengthening of cause-and-effect chains. Imagine a row of billiard balls, each ball a short distance from the next one. If you hit the first ball with your cue (cause), it will hit the second ball (effect), which will itself hit the third ball (second effect), and so on. Because of friction, energy is lost, and each next ball will move more slowly than the previous one, until the point where the ball stops before it has reached the next one in line: the causal chain has broken. With lower friction, the chain will be longer.
>
> This same mechanism applies to our low friction society. In earlier periods, an event happening in one country would have little or no effect on events happening in another country. The chain of effects would have died down long before it would have reached the national border. Nowadays, the world as a whole has become interdependent. A poor harvest in one country will affect the production in another country, which will affect the stock market in a third country, which will affect the employment in yet another country, and so on. Each of these events will not just have one effect, but many, each of which will again influence many other events. The ongoing decrease of friction makes these interactions more numerous and more complex.
>
> Because of this ever greater interdependency, subsystems of the superorganism need to keep informed about an increasing number of events taking place in other subsystems. Longer causal chains mean that many more potential causes and effects need to be monitored, resulting in the concurrent dangers of unpreparedness—when relevant information is not available—and information overload—when the system is incapable to effectively interpret the available information. This augments the selective pressure to develop a more sophisticated capacity for the gathering and processing of information, and therefore to increase the efficiency of the superorganism's nervous system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The reason why outsourcing increases efficiency is the cybernetic principle of functional autonomy. In a complex control system, consisting of many interrelated subsystems performing a variety of tasks, the higher order system cannot oversee the activities of all of its subsystems, since, according to Ashby's (1964) law of requisite variety, its own variety (complexity) would need to be at least as great as the variety of all the subsystems combined. In order to minimize the complexity of its own decisionmaking, the control system should as much as possible delegate decision-making to the subsystems, that is, make them autonomously responsible for carrying out their function. The only thing that needs to be controlled is whether the subsystems carry out their function; how they carry it out is up to them. This defines functional autonomy.
>
> It is only when the subsystems are incapable of making the right decisions that the higher-order system must intervene and tell them what to do. This means that the more autonomous subsystems are, that is, the more control they have over the way they carry out their function, the less hierarchical supervision they need. This is the essence of Aulin's (1982) law of requisite hierarchy: the required number of hierarchical levels decreases with increasing capacity for control in the subsystems. Since friction decreases and overall efficiency and control increase in all components of society, this means that present organizations and society at large can function with a strongly reduced number of hierarchical levels, thus making perception and action much more efficient. This explains the present trend towards the flattening of hierarchies. The towering pyramids of hierarchical levels in traditional bureaucracies merely reflected the poor regulatory ability of the individuals and subsystems in such a bureaucracy (and the tendency to institutionalize an intricate pecking order).
>
> Hierarchies not only tend to flatten, but to turn into [heterarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy), that is, networks of mutual influence without subordination...
>
> In conclusion, the improvement in communication, processing and control in all components of global society has a far-reaching impact on the structure of that society: the number of organizations performing the same function tends to decrease because of mergers and competitive exclusion, whereas the number of organizations performing different functions tends to increase, because of outsourcing, innovation, specialization and the discovery of new niches. At the same time, hierarchies are flattened or turned into heterarchies, and organizations become more autonomous in how they perform their functions, while becoming more dependent on society as a whole to determine which functions are in demand. Also, organizations become less dependent on specific individuals or geographic regions, and more defined by their activity or function.
>
> Thus, society increasingly resembles a complex organism, with its specialized cells, organs and tissues, that are functionally autonomous, but tightly integrated in a global, self-organizing network of mutually feeding processes. This is in clear contrast with the more traditional view of society as a bunch of essentially interchangeable individuals, groups and subgroups, separated by geographic distance or historic accident, that are jostling for power, while making temporary alliances. An important remaining difference is that cells in an organism tend to specialize early and irreversibly, whereas individuals and organizations in society remain able to switch from one function to another as demand or opportunities change, keeping the overall system very flexible." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The most common objection to a superorganism model is that people tend to interpret it as a thinly disguised way of promoting a totalitarian, collectivist system. Especially the use of words such as “control” and “collective” evokes immediate associations with Stalinism and the brutal oppression of individual liberties. These negative connotations may be understandable, but they are wholly misdirected. The societal evolution I have sketched is mostly an extrapolation of existing trends, and these show an on-going increase in freedom, individualism, democracy and decentralization rather than a decrease. These trends can be explained straightforwardly by the postulated mechanisms of differentiation, which opens ever more possibilities for an individual to choose a role, education, or occupation, of reduced friction, which increases the general freedom of movement, of expression, and of consumption, and of increasing autonomy, which reduces the need to tightly control or monitor an individual's activities. The complementary mechanism of integration could be seen as a source of new constraints or limitations, but these are likely to restrict the freedom of powerful individuals—such as a Stalin-like dictator or a robber baron—and organizations to abuse the system for their own ends, rather than the freedom of ordinary people to realize their individual ambitions. Global integration means an increasing mutual dependency of various organizations, and therefore an increasing difficulty for any one organization to dominate the others. This is understandably resented by those who have most power to lose, but should be welcomed by the less powerful." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "Insofar that totalitarian societies were based on an ideological or political system, such as Soviet communism, this system was very different from the self-organizing, cybernetic, “organism-like” system that this paper proposes. As discussed by the cybernetician and Soviet dissident Valentin Turchin, the Soviet system lacked the most crucial component of cybernetic control: feedback. Instead of a distributed feedback loop, constantly adapting to the changing circumstances, the Soviet economy was based on a rigid, mechanical, top-down command structure, with little regard for the effect of those commands in the real world. This led to the well-known “calculation problem”, where the central planning agency would find it impossible to determine exactly how many shoes would need to be produced to satisfy the needs of a given population. The resulting economic inefficiency contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The common idea that what you lose in comfort by dropping out, you gain in freedom, is based on a misunderstanding of what “freedom” means. Without technology and social support systems, life is basically a struggle for survival, where most energy and time must be directed towards finding the necessary food and shelter. By removing these requirements, society has given us the real freedom of doing what we want, where we want it, and (most of the time) when we want it, without having to worry whether we will be able to survive. Especially technology, such as the transport and communication systems, has enormously expanded our freedom of movement and of communication. The more the superorganism increases its differentiation and integration, the more options we will have to choose our occupation, or go wherever we want whenever we want. Of course, belonging to an encompassing system does impose certain constraints, aimed at maximizing the synergy between interacting components and minimizing mutual obstruction. However, such constraints do not generally reduce overall freedom. This may be illustrated by the traffic code. Being able to travel with your car wherever you want is a great freedom, which people from previous ages could hardly even imagine. However, for many people to drive safely and with a minimum of interference on the same roads, traffic rules must be followed." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "The possibility seems real that some groups or countries will effectively want to remain outside the emerging global society. It is also conceivable that different federations of countries will be formed, each following their own set of rules, while minimizing exchanges with each other. This happened to some degree during the Cold War when capitalist countries were politically and ideologically separated from the communist block. At the moment, the more important divisions perhaps oppose developed countries and developing nations, or countries with a Christian tradition and countries with an Islamic tradition. A deepening of such divisions could in principle lead to the creation of separate, competing superorganisms.
>
> Yet, there are several reasons why this scenario appears unlikely. The first reason is similar to the reason why individual drop-outs are rare. A country that would decide to leave the international community with its systems and rules, would immediately lose a great many benefits: resources, products, services, information, new technologies, solidarity, etc. This would significantly slow down or even reverse its development compared to other countries. This can be illustrated by the fate of “pariah” states, like Iraq, North Korea, or Albania before the fall of communism. Such growing backwardness would provide an increasingly strong incentive for the regime to change its policies.
>
> The negative effects of disconnecting from the rest of the world could be mitigated if a large number countries would “drop out” together, forming a rival block. However, the Cold War has shown that two competing blocks, even if they seem roughly matched in size, resources or military power, are unlikely to remain at the same level of development. Because economic and technological progress is an ever accelerating, exponential process, small differences in initial conditions or speed of development will lead to increasing gaps, until it becomes clear for everybody that the one block is more successful than the other one. This will put increasing pressure on the less successful block to open up towards the more successful one, in order to assimilate its successes.
>
> A second reason why a splitting up of the superorganism seems unlikely is the homogenizing effect of global communication on preferences and standards. If people have to choose between competing, but similarly valuable, alternatives, they tend to choose the one they encounter most often. This reinforces the lead of the most common one, in a positive feedback loop (the “law of increasing returns”) that quickly drives out all alternatives but one (“lock-in”). In a situation where communication between groups is limited, this may lead to different standards in different groups, but in an era of fast, global communication, all groups will tend to converge on a single standard in a rather short time." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

> "Since society is an organismic system consisting of organisms (individual people), it can be viewed as a “superorganism”. Conspicuous trends such as globalization, automation, and the rise of computer networks can be understood as aspects of the general evolution towards increasing efficiency and interconnectedness which makes the superorganism ever more robust. In particular, increasing efficiency explains the growing economic productivity and the decrease of friction, which facilitates all material and informational exchanges. The accompanying differentiation and integration explain the seemingly opposite trends towards outsourcing and mergers, and the growing importance of supranational rules, standards and institutions. Increasing efficiency of communication and control moreover explains the increasing functional autonomy of components (individuals or organizations), and the concurrent flattening of hierarchies and rise of heterarchies.
>
> Although the effects of these trends are mostly positive, for both individuals and society as a whole, some of the side-effects can be detrimental. Reduced friction in particular increases the risk that positive feedback processes would get out of control. It also leads to increasingly complex causal chains of interconnected events, augmenting the need for information gathering and processing. Controlling these dangers requires a strengthening of the superorganism's nervous system. This control system has both centralized and distributed components. Centralization is exemplified by the growing importance of global institutions, responsible for the formulation and implementation of international standards, rules and laws.
>
> Distributed control can be exemplified by the “invisible hand” that mutually adjusts supply and demand. Its effectiveness is boosted by the emerging global computer network. The increasing reach, capacity, and intelligence of this network allow it to automate more and more functions of the superorganism's nervous system. This will transform the World-Wide Web into a “global brain”, capable of sensing, interpreting, learning, thinking, deciding, and initiating actions. Individuals are likely to become more and more intimately connected to this intelligent network, through ubiquitous, intuitive interfaces, and eventually a direct brain-to-web connection." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)









> "Historically, I distinguish three approaches: organicist, encyclopedist and emergentist. While each of these conceptions provides an inspiring metaphor for understanding and guiding social development, each also has major shortcomings. The organicist perspective, by ignoring conflicts and competition and by studying the way things are, rather than how they might be or ought to be, tends to promote a status quo. The encyclopedist view, while inherently progressive, relies too much on rational planning and organization, and tends to ignore not only the potential for conflict, but also the intrinsic difficulty of unifying and centralizing something as context-dependent, complex and changeful as the world’s knowledge. The emergentist perspective, while emphasizing the potential for self-organization and radical evolutionary innovation, seems to suffer from wishful thinking, assuming that we just need to communicate more, become more conscious, or use technology to see a global brain miraculously emerge.
>
> I argue that these shortcomings can be overcome by integrating two existing theoretical frameworks: evolutionary theory and cybernetics. Biological evolution points us to the intrinsic sources of conflict, and how these have been overcome by evolving synergetic systems and control mechanisms against free riders. Cybernetics shows us how systems and control are organized in levels, and based on knowledge and communication. Evolutionary cybernetics introduces the concept of metasystem transition: the self-organization of individual components into a positive-sum system that functions at a higher level of intelligence and consciousness. More specific models associated with cybernetics, such as neural networks, distributed knowledge systems and stigmergy, help us to design concrete technologies that could support such a collective intelligence. The World Wide Web, finally, provides an extremely flexible and powerful platform for implementing and testing such technologies at the global level." - [Conceptions of a Global Brain: An Historical Review, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf)



> "Self-organization establishes a relation between the behavior of the individual components and the structure and functionality of the system as a whole: simple interactions at the local level give rise to complex patterns at the global level. This phenomenon is called emergence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Coordination can then be defined as: the structuring of actions in time and (social) space so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy between these actions. Coordination can be subdivided in four elementary processes or mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow, and aggregation." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Alignment is the simplest form of coordination. It means that the different actions (and therefore also their agents) “point in the same direction”, or, more precisely, aim at the same target." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Friction does not in general imply conflict between the agents, though. Perhaps the two individuals really want to reach the same overall goal, such as getting the obstacle off the road. However, because their actions are not coordinated, they effectively oppose each other. To minimize friction, they should somehow come to push in the same direction, i.e. align their actions." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This example illustrates the mechanism of self-organization at the most elementary level. An action that is not succesful will normally be varied (variation). On the other hand, an action that is successful will be maintained or reinforced (selective retention or multiplication). Successful actions are characterized by minimal friction and maximal synergy. Therefore, the evolutionary mechanism of the blind-variation-and-natural-selection of actions will sooner or later produce an interaction that is more synergetic and less frictional. This mechanism does not require any planning, knowledge, or intelligence on the part of the agents. The only assumption is that the agents obey a logic of trial-and-error or variation-and-selection, producing a variety of actions until they find one that is maximally productive and stick to that one, irrespective of what causes that increase in productivity. Therefore, self-organization is a process that occurs at all levels, from atoms to societies. Note that this mechanism synthesizes the principles of self-organization originally formulated by the founding fathers of the domain. Ashby conceived selforganization as the automatic “selection” of stable states (attractors) by a dynamic system. Von Foerster and Prigogine added that such attractors will be reached more quickly by injecting “random” or blind variation into the system, a principle they called “order from noise”, “order through fluctuations”, or “order out of chaos”." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Assume that agents prefer to do the tasks they are most skilled at, because those are the ones that will cost them least effort. In that case, it suffices for the different tasks to be laid out in such a way that all available agents can examine them. As soon as an agent recognizes a task that it is particularly skilled at, it will pick up that task, leaving less fitting tasks for the others. Thus, the number of remaining tasks will gradually diminish. There is of course the risk that the remaining tasks fit none of the remaining agents, but we can make the assumption that all agents are flexible to some degree and can if necessary do a task they are not particularly skilled at, albeit less efficiently. In this way, the different tasks will get performed in an overall rather efficient way, although the arrangement may not be optimal. (Such less-than-optimal, but more-thanacceptable performance is what we normally find in the real world, as opposed to the idealized world of mathematical models, where things tend to work either perfectly, or not at all…).
>
> One example of such self-organizing division of labor is Wikipedia, the Internet encyclopedia that is being written collaboratively by millions of people worldwide. No “editorin-chief” has divided the labor among the contributors, by specifying which expert should write a page on which subject, as is done in traditional encyclopedias. Instead, the “experts” have selfselected by starting to write, adding to, or correcting any page for which they felt they had sufficient competence to make a contribution. Thus, a football supporter may add something about the scoring percentages of his favorite team, while a butterfly collector may contribute something about the color patterns of her favorite species...
>
> With some minor variations, the same process happens in a market economy: different businesses spread out and specialize so as to maximally fill each of the available niches, i.e. delivering the specific products and services for which there is sufficient demand, and for which their competence in delivering it is at least as good as the one of their competitors. This form of self-organizing allocation of agents (firms) to tasks (supplying goods and services) is sometimes referred to as the “invisible hand” of the market. While in practice the solution will never be optimal, it has proven to be far superior to the alternative of a centralized economic planning, as practiced e.g. in the Soviet Union. The reason is that the “calculation problem” of establishing exactly how many goods of which type need to be delivered by whom is much too complex to be solved by any planner. Only self-organization can produce robust solutions to problems of such complexity and variability." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "As long as a large enough number of agents with sufficiently diverse or broad skills is available, such a self-organizing solution to the problem of workflow can be quite efficient. There is no need to plan when a particular agent should execute a particular task, as long as enough agents are available so that a sufficiently skilled one is ready to take over soon after the previous task is finished." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "While division of labor is a branching process, where an activity is split up into smaller, independently executed tasks, aggregation goes the other way, letting the branches converge again into a single result. Division of labor, workflow and aggregation can be seen as the three fundamental aspects or dimensions of a complex, branching network of mutually dependent processes.
>
> Aggregation too allows for self-organizing approaches. The simplest one is when the different actions superimpose their results on a shared substrate or medium. For example, the work done by the different builders and technicians on a house accumulates in the physical building itself. There is no need to assemble the plumbing with the electrical circuitry as both have been installed on the same walls. But aggregation via a shared medium can also apply to more abstract, informational activities. Again, Wikipedia provides an excellent example: the different contributions to this encyclopedia of global knowledge are aggregated automatically because they are added to the same website. Without this shared electronic medium, assembling the millions of contributions into a coherent whole would have been a task of gigantic proportions...
>
> A different form of self-organizing aggregation occurs when the products of the different activities can interact and develop links or “bonds”, where the one fits in with the other. The examples we discussed before of the spontaneous division of labor in ecosystems or market economies are also examples of spontaneous integration. Businesses or species not only differentiate from other businesses or species in order to better occupy as yet unclaimed niches, they also connect themselves to other businesses or species as providers of resources or services that they need for their own functioning. Thus, a typical business will be a tightly linked hub in a network of suppliers, clients, employees, regulators, and other stakeholders that all depend on each other. Together, they form an integrated socioeconomic system that performs a coherent set of functions for society. The mechanism behind this is again variation and selection: agents interact with many other agents. If the interaction is succesful, they will tend to maintain it (selective retention), thus creating a stable bond of mutual dependency. Otherwise, the interaction will be stopped (elimination) and replaced by another one." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Collective intelligence assumes thatdifferent agents have different forms of expertise (knowledge, information, skills). Otherwise,they would not be able to do more together than individually. Achieving collective intelligencetherefore is a problem of cognitive coordination between the different agents. This can again besplit up into the four basic mechanisms of alignment, division of labor, workflow andaggregation.
>
> Alignment means that the agents should point at the same targets, so that they do notwork at cross-purposes. This implies that agents should agree at least about what the problem isthat is to be solved, and about what the different tools or methods are they may need to tackle itcollaboratively. However, alignment here does not mean that the agents should perform thesame actions, because in that case there is no collective intelligence. Adding identical effortstogether, like when a number of agents push a heavy weight in the same direction, only makessense when performing physical tasks, not when processing information. Indeed, when you adda piece of information (e.g. X=3) to the same piece of information (X=3), you still only have asingle piece of information. Therefore, a division of labor, in the sense of different agentscontributing different information, is essential. Depending on the complexity of the problem,workflow may or may not be needed. Some problems can be solved in a single step, all agentssimultaneously contributing their expertise. Others need several iterations, the one buildingfurther on the previous one. But the final step of aggregating all the contributions remainsessential in order to come to a coherent answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "[Surowiecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Surowiecki) proposes the following list of requirements that a group must fulfil to exhibit collective intelligence (or wisdom of crowds, as he calls it):
>
> • Diversity: the more diverse the knowledge and experience possessed by the different members of the group, the more the group as whole knows and the less its members are likely to overlook certain aspects, or to fall prey to the same bias.
>
> • Independence: individuals should express their contribution as much as possible independently from other members of the group; otherwise, when the opinion of the oneis influenced by the opinion of the other, there is a risk of premature alignment, i.e.between the contributions themselves rather than between the targets of thecontributions.
>
> • Decentralization: this Surowiecky’s term for what we have called “division of labor”: people should as much as possible be able to gather and process their information in parallel, so that they can together cover an as wide range of aspects as possible.
>
> • Aggregation: collective intelligence requires an effective mechanism, such as voting, averaging or discussion, for synthesizing a diversity of individual opinions into a single,collective answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The most important issue in such collective processes is to avoid what Janis has called “groupthink”. This is the phenomenon where people in a group all start to think the same, because a slight initial preference for one approach rather than another becomes amplified via positive feedback. The underlying dynamic is that if someone hears an opinion expressed by someone else, s/he will be more inclined to express a similar opinion. This happens partly because hearing a certain approach will “prime” the mind to consider things from the same perspective, partly because people tend to be conformist, and do not like to contradict or appear to be in conflict with others. The more often similar opinions have been expressed, the less likely group members are to express dissimilar opinions—partly out of conformism, partly because the more they hear a particular position defended, the more they will get convinced that this is the right one, and the less they will be inclined to think of alternatives. In that way, they may all quickly converge to the same opinion, without giving potentially better alternatives the chance to be duly considered.
>
> A more extreme version of this process leads to the phenomenon of group polarization (also known as “risky shift”). This refers to the common observation that groups tend to be more extreme in their judgments after a discussion than the members were individually before the discussion. “More extreme” here means deviating more from the middle ground. For example, if jury members are individually inclined to judge a crime relatively harshly (e.g. proposing a 15-year prison sentence on average), after the debates they will tend to judge it even more harshly (e.g. deciding on a 25-year prison term). If a different group is asked to judge the same crime, but the members are individually inclined to be more lenient (e.g. proposing a 10-year sentence on average), as a group they are likely to come to an even more lenient judgment (e.g. a 5-year sentence). Polarization can be explained by the positive feedback underlying alignment, which amplifies deviations: the more people hear arguments for a “risky” position, the more they will think themselves of additional arguments for that position, and the more confident they will become in moving further away from the “safe” middle ground.

> Groupthink is an example of self-organization gone wrong, where non-linear interaction has led to premature alignment on a suboptimal solution, and where the positive contributions of diversity and division of labor have been neglected." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The simplest way to avoid groupthink is to disallow direct communication between the group members, so that the one cannot influence the other one until everyone has been able make a full contribution. However, a collective solution still requires an aggregation mechanism that integrates these different contributions.
>
> This is perhaps easiest to achieve when the looked for solution can be expressed as a number. In that case, everyone can independently make an estimate of the correct number, e.g. by writing it onto a piece of paper. The pieces are then collected, and the final solution is aggregated by calculating the average of the numbers. In many cases, this produces remarkably good results. For example, when at a fair people are asked to estimate the number of beans in a jar, or the weight of a bull, the average of their guesses is typically much more accurate than even the best of the individual guesses. The reason is that each individual guess is biased by the limited experience of that individual, making the estimate either too low or too high. However, when many independent estimates are aggregated, these “errors” or deviations from the optimal solution tend to be “averaged out”, because of the law of large numbers. This phenomenon can be demonstrated through agent simulations even for more complex problem solutions, as long as the solution can be expressed as a  sequence of numbers that need to be averaged, and as long as the individual agents vary randomly in the errors they make.
>
> However, when different individuals tend to have the same bias (e.g. all overestimating the weight of the bull), their aggregate solution will exhibit that bias too, and the best individual estimate will be more accurate than the average for the group.
>
> The averaging method only works for quantitative decisions. Some of the most common methods, such as discussion in committee meetings, do not obey the criteria of independence and decentralization, and therefore may lead to poor results. The result can be improved if the different members express their opinions independently and anonymously (e.g. on a computersupported discussion system) before they start responding to the opinions of others, and if the discussion is guided by a neutral moderator, who ensures that everybody duly answers all the important questions, and responds to criticisms of their previous answers. The anonymity makes sure that everybody’s ideas are given equal attention (instead of the discussion being dominated by the more authoritative people). This is the basis of the so-called Delphi method that aggregates the ideas of a panel of experts, via several rounds of anonymous, mediated discussion." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "To shift from individual intelligence to collective intelligence, we need to make intentionality collective as well. Words and other symbols can only be used for effective communication if the conversation partners understand them in the same way, that is if they agree about wat the word refers to. Developing such shared references is a problem of what we have called alignment. We have defined alignment as the unification or merging of the targets of different actions or agents. As long as there is no “director” agent to impose a target on the others, this problem can only be solved through selforganization, that is, spontaneous, reciprocal adaptation of the agents’ targets." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This is the same mechanism of alignment that underlies all self-organization: by reducing the friction that is otherwise caused by the need to recognize and interpret a novel form and because of the high probability of confusion that arises if the conversation partners use different forms, alignment on the same forms makes communication more efficient. As shown by many experiments and observations, one-to-one alignment is a very quick and automatic process that makes conversation much easier than it would be if the partners would have to explicitly agree about how they refer to the different items in their shared context Conversational alignment will not only produce shared references; it will moreover tend to make those references simpler and more efficient." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Establishing a shared system of reference (alignment) is only the first step in collaboratively solving a problem. Moreover, alignment can go too far, in the sense that unusual, but valuable, approaches are suppressed because of the tendency of the largest subgroup to impose its “targets” on the rest of the group. When alignment merely concerns the establishment of lexical conventions or agreed-upon labels, then in essence any label is as good as any other, and alignment is a priori positive. However, when the “targets” of thought and action are fundamentally different, excluding some targets because they represent minority positions will a priori reduce the potential for collective intelligence. Typical experiments in collective problemsolving either artificially impose maximal independence on the individuals (e.g. requiring them to write down their opinion anonymously) until the moment when their contributions are aggregated (e.g. by counting votes or averaging guesses), or allow free-ranging discussion with the intent to come to a consensual decision, thus running the risk of groupthink and a loss of collective intelligence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Typical conditions that have been proposed for the emergence of groupthink are direction by an authoritative leader, conformity pressure, and the need to come to a clear-cut consensus. All were absent in the experimental set-up. Since the issue they discussed had 20 different components, it was difficult to come to a clear conclusion. Perhaps most importantly, the participants filled in the survey individually after the discussion. Therefore, there was no pressure, neither explicitly nor implicitly, to “conform” to the opinions of the others, since no one knew exactly what those others had entered in their survey forms. Still, there was some convergence between opinions, but this seems to have been of the “healthy” kind, where participants learned things from each other that were missing from their own limited perspective." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The underlying dynamic of self-organization is local trial-and-error or variation-andselection, in which two interacting agents try to mutually adapt their actions, until they hit on a “coordinated” pattern that is acceptable to both, and thus is selectively retained. This local pattern is then typically propagated step-by-step to the neighboring agents and the neighbors’ neighbors. The spreading “wave” of coordination is thus amplified until it encompasses the global system, via a process of positive feedback.
>
> Coordination can be decomposed into four relatively independent mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation. Alignment is the simplest, as it merely requires the agents to “point in the same direction”, i.e. direct their actions at the same targets. This is necessary to avoid the friction that is otherwise caused by opposing actions. Alignment creates convergence or homogeneity between interacting agents. When the agents are distributed across space, the resulting homogeneity may be limited to a certain region, with boundaries between differently aligned regions emerging after self-organization. This can explain the appearance of separate cultures or languages, and the points of friction between them.
>
> Even when such remaining friction is avoided, alignment is not yet sufficient to reap the full benefits of synergy, in which the whole of the actions produces more than the sum of the effects produced by each action separately. Synergy requires complementarity, in which one action makes up for what the other one lacks, so that together they can achieve goals that they cannot achieve alone. Synergy is promoted by the other three coordination mechanism. Division of labor means that different agents perform different actions at the same time, so that each can contribute its unique expertise to the part of problem it is most skilled at. Workflow means that an action is followed by a subsequent action that fills in the gaps left by the previous one. Aggregation, finally, ensures that all these different contributions are assembled into a coherent outcome." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The first issue here is the emergence of collective intentionality: how do groups align the targets of their communications and actions? In the domain of language, this problem has been investigated by means of a variety of software simulations and experiments with groups or pairs of conversing individuals. The basic mechanism is that each time an agent targets a particular referent or communicative structure in its interaction with another agent, this primes (weakly prepares) the second agent to target a similar referent, making a shift towards a common referent slightly easier. Many such small, individual shifts eventually snowball into the emergence of a reference shared by the whole group. This research confirms and illustrates the general mechanism of self-organizing alignment, while clarifying the origin of linguistic conventions.
>
> A second issue is the emergence of collective intelligence: in how far do people manage to solve problems better as a group than individually? Most research in this domain has focused on the problems of groupthink and polarization, a form of premature alignment in which valuable contributions are suppressed because of a tendency of groups to conform to and reinforce any emerging consensus. This results in phenomena of “collective stupidity” or “madness of crowds”, rather than “collective intelligence” or “wisdom of crowds”. The general  recommendation therefore has been to minimize the (non-linear) interactions between individuals that promote alignment, and to use some neutral mechanism such as averaging to directly aggregate the individual contributions. While this strategy is undoubtedly useful in a number of cases, it risks to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as it makes self-organizing division of labor and especially workflow more difficult." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "If you go up in evolution to more and more sophisticated organisms, and then you look at the horizon in space and time—that’s to say: the things that they can either remember or imagine or perceive to be things that have happened or could be happening—as you go from a bacterium to a multicellular organism, to a simple animal, to a human, that horizon expands. So we become more and more aware of things that are happening or maybe happening not in our immediate spatial-temporal neighborhood. We become more and more aware of things that may be far removed in time and space. And that could be a simple interpretation of this law of growth of complexity. The field of complexity—that means that the things you can be conscious of—tends to increase with evolution. And there’s a good reason why that should be. That is that evolution is based on natural selection. Natural selection means fitness, means the ability to deal with all kinds of problems and challenges. And the wider your horizon is, the better you can see any possible challenges coming, the better you will be ready to deal with the difficult ones and to protect yourself from them, and the better you will also be ready to deal with a positive ones; to exploit the opportunities. So I think this view of the superorganism is telling us that we should expand our horizon of consciousness from the individual human to the level of humanity as a whole." - [Francis Heylighen](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/glimpsing-the-global-brain#:~:text=if%20you%20go,as%20a%20whole.)

> "Since the environment anyway is variable, the more adaptability you have at the moment, the better you are. So there is a tendency to evolve into systems that can adapt to a wide range of things. If they can adapt only to a particular range of things, they are likely to be eliminated by the next change in the environment. So this increase in the range of things we can deal with, that’s something that can be expressed even in the form of a cybernetic law. It’s called the Law of Requisite Variety. The cyberneticist Ashby says: if you have to deal with various perturbations, the more [variety of actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)) that you can do, the better you will be able to deal with all these problems. So there is, you might say, a selective pressure for living systems to increase the variety of things they can do. And increasing the things they can do, that means on the one hand getting the physiological anatomical features to do these things—which means increasing complexity—but it also means a kind of a cognitive increase: an increase in the number of things that they can sense and the amount of knowledge they have to know “How do I deal with these circumstances?” So the selective pressure is to increase the range of challenges you can deal with, and that is a progressive evolution. There is no doubt about that. The example I gave supposed that you have two systems, one that can deal with situation A, B, C, and the other one can deal with situations A, B, C, D. Well, as long as the situation is A, B, or C, they’re both equally good. But the moment that the situation changes into D, the first one gets killed off and the second one remains. So therefore, there is a selective pressure to be able to deal with a wider range of things. And that implies all this progressive evolution towards more intelligence, more consciousness, more flexibility, more complexity, et cetera. So the third story is really that evolution is progressive. We learn to deal with a wider range of situations. We expand our consciousness to a wider range of challenges and opportunities." - [Francis Heylighen](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/glimpsing-the-global-brain#:~:text=since%20the%20environment,challenges%20and%20opportunities.)

This is currently one of the most fundamental points of debate within the Global Brain community and also one of the arguments in favor of a more active and normative approach. It is not enough to passively observe, describe and anticipate the emergence of a Global Brain, as earlier theorists have tended to do. We need to ensure that the fundamental diversity in perspectives and constant exploration, presented by Weinbaum and Veitas (2015) as a “world of views”, indeed becomes its operating principle. Therefore, we must actively engage in the conceptual, social and technological development of the Global Brain, and try to make sure that it is not hijacked by special interests, conformity pressures, or processes of homogenization. As Helbing (2016) puts it, in designing the future information society, “we should engage in systemic pluralism and should be much more experimental”, thus constantly expanding and renewing diversity." - [The Global Brain as a model of the future information society: An introduction to the special issue, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/TFSC-intro.pdf)

> "As Veitas and Weinbaum (2016) conclude their paper: “No matter what kind of technologies will be enablers of the distributed social governance, it will be based not on the design of optimal institutions, but rather on the processes”. The Global Brain should not be thought of as a static agent, or even as an institution, but as a type of process: a process that explores creative possibilities, connects unconnected dots, and (re)cognizes and exploits potential synergies by bringing into contact the most diverse ideas, people and resources. A better metaphor for this phenomenon than the monotheistic God might be the Tao. The Tao is not an agent, but a “way”, a “path”, a principle of (self-)organization. Such mode of existence positions it below, not above, all other things and this is why “myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them” (Lao-tzu, 2006). In such a holistic, process-based perspective, there is no strict separation between body, mind and world, and therefore no homunculus acting as a central controller. There is merely an endless, encompassing stream of interactions being intelligently coordinated via distributed self-organization." - [The Global Brain as a model of the future information society: An introduction to the special issue, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/TFSC-intro.pdf)

Only a small part of the population will be called to do the latter and both help Metamodern Religion emerge in the first place and then improve and maintain it. Whoever is called to this work will likely have a certain temperament and a certain level of development in specific areas.

Large-scale knowledge-sharing projects, such as the Wikipedia online encyclopedia, and volunteer software-programming initiatives, such as the Apache Webserver (which runs two-thirds of the websites in the world), demonstrate the inadequacy of our assumptions about expertise in the twenty-first century. Ordinary people, regardless of institutional affiliation or professional status, possess information–serious, expert, fact-based, scientific information–to enhance decision-making, information not otherwise available to isolated bureaucrats. Partly as a result of the simple tools now available for collaboration and partly as a result of a highly mobile labor market of "knowledge workers," people are ready and willing to share that information across geographic, disciplinary, and institutional boundaries." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

It is not necessary to pre-select authenticated and known professionals when structures can be put in place to ensure that informational inputs are discernable, specific, well-labeled, and easy to search, sort, and use. An online system will not be without its own problems and abuses, but the assumption is that greater public participation, not in setting values but in supplying information or making sense of and connections between informational sources supplied by others, can substantively improve decision-making." - [Wiki-Government - How open-source technology can make government decision-making more expert and more democratic](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/7/wiki-government/)

> "Our institutions of governance are characterized by a longstanding culture of professionalism in which bureaucrats–not citizens–are the experts. Until recently, we have viewed this arrangement as legitimate because we have not practically been able to argue otherwise. Now we have a chance to do government differently. We have the know-how to create "civic software" that will help us form groups and communities who, working together, can be more effective at informing decision-making than individuals working alone. We know from James Surowiecki’s book, The Wisdom of Crowds, as well as Simon and Schuster’s new MediaPredict project (which encourages readers to guess which manuscripts will become best-sellers), that technology can be used to aggregate predictions. But Peer- to-Patent is teaching us that we can go beyond the tallying of votes. While the general public has good instincts about value-based decisions and could be engaged betterto identify "big mistakes" (such as egregiously unfair media ownership rules), there are specific people out there who possess specific information about patents or trucks or chemicals whom we can now incorporate into our decision-making.

> In order to make it possible for ordinary, busy people to participate, and for government to make use of their knowledge, government must design the practices of public participation to enable groups, not just individuals, to participate. Agencies must crystallize the questions they ask of the public and embed those targeted practices into software. Of course, not even the best-designed civic software is going to stop government from making bad decisions or ignoring–willfully or otherwise–good information dropped in its lap. And there will be manipulation and gaming, to be sure. But these are not reasons to shy away from opening up the practices of governance, especially when those practices can evolve over time to respond to problems that may arise.
>
> Opening up closed decision-making also introduces a greater degree of transparency and accountability than we have had before. For example, even if Peer-to-Patent does not yield good research or prior art every time, many eyeballs on the application still encourage the inventor to do a better job of writing it and produce public debate and discussion about the application. It drives more information into the open and encourages the "liberation" of government data, not for its own sake, but as an enabler for engagement.

What this next generation of civic software can do, however, is introduce better information by enabling the expert public to contribute targeted information.

> "The problem of overcoming the conflicts intrinsic to competitive relations is exemplified by the Prisoners’ Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons. In different situations, different solutions have typically evolved. However, these solutions are all related, in the sense that they can be viewed as institutions in the broadest sense of the word, i.e. as socially agreed-upon systems of rules and control mechanisms for enforcing them, that regulate and coordinate interactions between agents so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "After a while, the network of trails will have stabilized so that individual animals only need to contribute a minimal effort to its maintenance. Thus, the influence of individual agents on the medium tends to decrease. On the other hand, as the network becomes more reliable and extensive, the influence of the medium on the agents’ activities increases. Eventually, the asymmetry is inverted: where initially we would see the agents as manipulating the medium, now it becomes more parsimonious to see the medium as directing the agents. The medium has turned into a mediator: it coordinates the individual activities so as to minimize friction or conflict, and to maximize synergy. The classic example of such an “active” coordination medium can be found in the pheromone trails that ants create while searching for food. The trail network functions like an external memory or “collective mental map” for the ant colony, directing the individual ants to the different food sources and the nest via the most efficient routes." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "The remarkable efficiency of the Internet is at present still mostly physical or informational, not social. The Internet has grown so quickly that it has not had the time to evolve efficient institutions, i.e. collective systems of rules that coordinate individual actions. The result is a messy, confusing and constantly changing information landscape, that in principle offers immense benefits, but in practice only works reliably for a limited number of applications, while producing confusion, information overload, and various forms of “cybercrime”. As a result, an individual discovery published on the net may indeed change the world’s outlook within days, but the more likely outcome is that it will get buried within masses of other, mostly much less relevant information, and not receive the attention it deserves.
>
> In conclusion, the evolutionary dynamics underlying globalization has already led to a relatively efficient physical distribution of matter, energy and information across the globe, but still needs to produce the social institutions that go with it. This is not a very original observation: critics of the globalization of markets have pointed out that the extension of the free trade in goods and services needs to be counterbalanced by the further development of transnational institutions, such as UN, UNESCO, WHO, etc., to protect the rights of children, workers, consumers, cultural groups or the environment. The “stigmergic” theory proposed here, however, suggests a number of complementary mechanisms through which new types of institutions are likely to evolve.

> The main idea is that the external interaction medium, a role that is increasingly dominated by the Internet, will evolve into a mediator. This mediator will not only facilitate, but direct, and eventually control, interactions so as to maximize their synergy. To achieve that, the medium needs to develop a form of intelligent management of the communication processes it supports, leading to what may be called collective intelligence or distributed cognition. When this distributed intelligence spans the world, the resulting system may be called the Global Brain." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "The basic mechanism whereby useful paths are gradually reinforced, and less useful ones weakened, provides a very general heuristic to tackle a variety of problems. It can be seen as a quantitative, stigmergic instantiation of the mechanism of evolution itself: maintain and grow the fit (useful); reduce, and eventually eliminate, the unfit...
>
> Furthermore, the same mechanism seems to underlie learning in the brain: neuronal connections that are successfully used become stronger; the others become weaker. It is this analogy that initially inspired me to conceive of the World-Wide Web as a potential Global Brain. The web is a distributed network of documents connected by hyperlinks along which people travel (“surf”) from page to page... when people surfing the web end up in a particularly interesting page, they are likely to create one or more new links from their own pages pointing directly to it, thus shortcutting the long sequence they followed before finding it. This increases the number of links to the page, and the probability that other people would encounter it. The overall effect is captured by Google’s PageRank algorithm, which provides a measure of the importance of a website as determined by the links directly or indirectly pointing to it. This is another example of quantitative stigmergy: the actions of many independent agents (people inserting links) on a shared medium (the web) produce a collective ranking (PageRank) that helps other agents find the options (documents) most likely to be useful to them." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "Agent swarms can perform not only the equivalent of intuitive, subconscious processes of activation spreading through the brain, but of systematic, logical search and deduction. To achieve that, the knowledge in the web needs to be organized according to a consensual ontology, i.e. a formal system of categories and relationships. Developing such ontologies is the goal of the Semantic Web project. Given such a semantic network, a software agent could be programmed with a “grammar” of rules that tell it to only explore or return certain categories of nodes and links. A swarm of such agents should for example be able to find all birds that do not fly, or the most representative researchers (as measured e.g. by PageRank or citation impact) who have written about globalization and evolution, cite publications of Modelski, work in one of the NATO countries and have a PhD, so that you can invite them to your NATO-sponsored workshop.
>
> In conclusion, quantitative stigmergy is able to turn the web from a passive medium for communication and storage of information into an intelligent mediator that uses learning and inference mechanisms similar to those of the human brain to recommend to its users the actions, information sources, or people most likely to be helpful for their aims. To achieve this, the intelligent web draws on the experience and knowledge of its users collectively, as externalized in the “trace” of preferences they leave on the paths they have traveled." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "A major effect of stigmergy is the acceleration of evolution: a solution to an evolutionary problem found by one agent can now, by impressing it upon the medium, be used and improved by other agents. Since the medium benefits all agents’ fitness, there will be a selective pressure on the agents to find solutions that make the medium itself more powerful. The further the medium extends, and the easier it becomes for agents to interact with it, the quicker innovations will spread and undergo further improvements. This leads to a self-reinforcing process: improvement of the medium facilitates further innovation, which in turn helps improve the medium." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "Connectivity implies an increase in the number of agents one is interacting with, and therefore an increase in social complexity, with the concomitant threats of competition, conflict, and confusion. These problems too can be conceptualized most generally as a form of friction, i.e. the (generally unintended) obstruction of one agent’s actions by one or more other agents’ actions. As in the case of technological progress, the trial-and-error of evolution will tend to reduce this social friction by creating adapted institutions. Institutions, or more generally mediators, are systems that coordinate the activities of different agents so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy.
>
> A largely overlooked, but very powerful, mechanism for the spontaneous evolution of mediators is stigmergy, which relies on the medium or environment shared by the agents. Stigmergic interaction means that the change produced by one agent to the medium stimulates another agent to perform a complementary action, promoting their collective benefit even without any conscious intention to cooperate. Stigmergic activity will gradually reshape the passive medium into an active mediator, which elicits and directs the agents’ actions.
>
> The most “ephemeralized” example of the technological infrastructure underlying global connectivity is the Internet. A quick inspection shows that it provides a near ideal medium for stigmergic interaction: it instantaneously connects people all across the planet, is nearly always and everywhere available, can be used virtually without cost, is plastic enough to accommodate practically any “shape” or information that is imprinted upon it, while it will accurately register and store this information for as long as necessary. What it still lacks are the more evolved mediator functions. Yet, there already exist several examples of Internet services—such as the Google search engine or the Wikipedia website—that very successfully apply stigmergic principles to coordinate individual activities, thus offering their users a form of distributed intelligence well beyond the capabilities of a single individual.
>
> A straightforward extrapolation of this evolution that injects ever more intelligence into the Internet leads me to expect a near-term shift from World-Wide Web to Global Brain. The “Global Brain” is more than a fancy term for a large-scale intelligent system, though: the analogy runs much deeper. An analysis of the stigmergic mechanisms that seem most effective in supporting such distributed intelligence shows that they are virtually identical to the mechanisms used by the human brain. The quantitative stigmergy exemplified by “ant algorithms” is nearly identical to the process of Hebbian or reinforcement learning that differentially strengthens connections between neurons in the brain. The “ants” that trace and explore the quantitatively weighted network formed in this way correspond to human or software agents searching the web, or to bursts of activation spreading across the brain. Qualitative stigmergy, which is the true motor of innovation, can be seen as the basis of symbolic consciousness in the brain. It is exemplified on the web by a variety of collaborative, “open access” sites where people freely improve on each other’s contributions." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

But the tendency toward secrecy and hierarchical organization, enforced by (among other factors) the key economic role played by businesses with a central goal of competitively maximizing shareholder value, places the focus on processes occurring within organizations and individuals rather than on distributed network activities. In the Open Collaboration/Exchange Networks approach, interactions occur among individuals ­­ and organizations form based on explicit exchanges between individuals ­­ and this allows higher­level patterns of organization and adaptation to become more complex and explicit.

> "Mathematically, one may say that human beings’ value systems are “partial orderings” – they allow a person to say whether X is more valuable than Y, in a certain context. But money requires something stronger than this – it requires the arrangement of all entities to be valued in a “total ordering”, so that any X and Y can be compared as to their relative values. This has the merit of simplicity; it allows values to be arranged along a number line, so that one can assign each entity whose value is of concern a single number representing its value. But it has the shortcoming of not actually agreeing with the way human minds think and feel about values. In a partial ordering, mathematically, two entities X and Y may simply be incommensurable. NRdimensional vectors (for N>1) are like this; it doesn’t always mean something to say that vector X is “greater than” vector Y. In a value system that is a partial but not total ordering, there may be entities X and Y whose values are incommensurable – there is no clear answer regarding whether X is more valuable than Y or vice versa. This is how human value systems work, even though it’s not how money works." - [Offer Networks, a Potential Infrastructure for a Post-Money Economy, by Ben Goertzel](https://globalbraininstitute.github.io/onet/files/offer_networks.pdf)

> "Why are we willing to work so hard at things we don’t like doing, in order to buy so many things we don’t need? Part of the answer is addiction – we become psychologically addicted to certain routines and possessions, e.g. eating out in restaurants instead of cooking at home, or driving in a private car instead of taking public transport, or the feeling of wearing new & different clothes or jewelry. And part of the answer is social status. Having a lot of money is itself an indicator of high social status; and money can be used to buy other status indicators. A tremendous amount of money is spent on status symbols of one sort or another. Of course, money is not the only status indicator. Einstein had a very high status in the public eye, yet was not terribly rich. The same for Linux Torvalds.

> "The most simple and common definition of intelligence is the ability to solve problems. A problem can be defined as a difference between the present situation (the initial state), and an ideal or desired situation (the goal state or solution). Problem solving then means finding a path through the “problem space” that leads from the initial state (say, x) to the goal (say, y). This requires determining the right sequence of steps that leads from x to y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Intelligence is highly context-dependent: more important than the absolute number of problems you can solve, is whether you can solve the most significant problems in your present environment. Adding the capability to solve some purely theoretical problems that are of no use in your present or future environment will in general not increase your fitness (i.e. probability of long-term survival)—and may even decrease it if it would make you waste time on contemplating irrelevant issues." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The simplest model of intelligence is a look-up table or mapping. This is a list of condition-action rules, of the form: if your problem is x, then the (action you need to perform to attain the) solution is y. In short: if x, then y, or, even shorter: x → y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The next, more complex model of intelligence is a deterministic algorithm. This is a fixed-length or iterated sequence of actions that need to be performed on the initial state, until the state they produce satisfies the condition for being a solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The view of problem solving as computation or as heuristic search seems to imply a sequential process, in which the different steps are performed one by one. A first step in our intended generalization towards distributed, parallel processes is the reinterpretation of problem solving as information processing. The initial state or problem statement can be interpreted as a piece of information received by the agent. The solution of the problem is a new piece of information produced by the agent in response to the problem statement. The task of the intelligent agent is then to transform or process the input information (problem, initial state, “question”) via a number of intermediate stages into the output information (solution, goal state, “answer”)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Compared to the sequential models of intelligence, neural networks have two big advantages:
>
> 1) processing happens in a parallel, distributed manner, making it more robust and flexible;
>
> 2) the network does not need an explicit program to know how it should function: it can learn from experience.
>
> The distributed character of neural networks means that its information and “knowledge” are not localized in a single component: they are spread out across all the nodes and links, which together contribute to the final solution. This makes the processing much more robust: individual components may be missing, malfunctioning or contain errors; yet, the disturbances this introduces to the process are drowned out by the contributions from the other components when everything is aggregated. In a sequential process, on the other hand, every step or component through which the process passes constitutes a bottleneck: if that component breaks down, the process may never recover.
>
> The learning happens via a general “reward” or reinforcement mechanism: links that have been successfully used in producing a good solution become stronger; the others become weaker. After many experiences of successful or failed processing, the relative strengths of the different connections will have shifted so that the probability of overall success has become much larger. This intrinsically simple mechanism only works for complex problems because of the distributed character of the processing: if only the process as a whole could be rewarded or punished, this would not produce enough information for it to learn a complex, subtle procedure consisting of many different actions collaborating towards a global solution. Because the process is distributed, its components can learn individually, so that the one can be reinforced at the same time as its neighbor is weakened, thus rebalancing their relative contributions." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The view of intelligence as a capability for problem solving or information processing runs into a fundamental issue: what is a meaningful problem, or meaningful information? Why should an intelligent agent address certain problems or process certain information, and disregard others? In other words, how does an agent decide what to do or pay attention to? In the approach of traditional artificial intelligence (AI), this issue is ignored, as AI programs are conceived essentially as question-answering systems: the user or programmer introduces the question (problem, query, input), and the program responds with an answer (solution, output).
>
> On the other hand, the issue becomes inevitable once you start to design autonomous systems, i.e. systems that should be able to act intelligently in the absence of an instructor telling them what to do. Such a system should at least have a value system, i.e. a set of explicit or implicit criteria that allow it distinguish “good” outcomes from “bad” ones. Given the ability to evaluate or value phenomena, the agent can then itself decide what aspects of its situation are “problematic” and therefore require some solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The difference between positive (growth) and negative (deficiency) values roughly corresponds to the difference between positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions (e.g. fear, anger, or sadness) occur when a need is frustrated or threatened, i.e. when the agent encounters a perturbation that it may not be able to compensate. Positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, curiosity) on the other hand, function to broaden your domain of interest and build up cognitive, material, or social resources. In other words, they motivate you to connect, explore, play, seek challenges, learn, experience, etc. Negative emotions tend to narrowly focus your attention to the problem at hand, so that you can invest all your resources in tackling that problem; positive emotions tend to widen your field of attention so that it becomes open to discovering new opportunities for growth.
>
> A general theory of values should encompass both positive or growth values, and negative or deficiency values. The present paper will not further develop such a theory. Yet, it is worth pointing out that such a theory would be an important contribution to a general model of intelligence and of the global brain, and therefore definitely worth investigating. Some inspiration can be found in the various psychological theories of motivation or needs, which include fundamental needs/values such as security, social affiliation, achievement and knowledge. More generally, from an evolutionary perspective, all values can be derived from the fundamental value of fitness (survival, development, and reproduction), since natural selection has ensured that agents that did not successfully strive for fitness have been eliminated from the scene." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Valence can be understood as the subjective appreciation by an agent of the global utility, well-being or fitness offered by a particular phenomenon or situation. It can be formalized as a scalar variable, which is larger than zero for positive situations, smaller than zero for negative ones, and zero for neutral or indifferent ones." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "A challenge is a situation that carries valence for an agent, so that the agent is inclined to act, in the case of negative valence by suppressing the perceived disturbance(s), in the case of positive valence by exploring or exploiting the perceived opportunity(ies). More concisely, we can define a challenge as a phenomenon that invites action from an agent. Negative challenges correspond to what we have called problems; positive challenges represent affordances for growth or progress. But note that these are not opposites but independent dimensions, since a challenge can carry both positive and negative valences. For example, for a hunter, encounter with a wild boar is both an opportunity, since a wild boar has tasty meat, and a problem, since a wild boar is dangerous. For a company, a free trade agreement can be both positive, since it gives access to new clients, and negative, since it opens the door to new competitors. A challenge incites action because it represents a situation in which not acting will lead to an overall lower fitness than acting—because the agent gains fitness by taking action, loses fitness by not taking action, or both. Thus, a challenge can be seen as a promise of fitness gain for action relative to inaction.
>
> However, a challenge merely inspires or stimulates action, it does not impose it. The reason is that a complex situation will typically present many challenging phenomena, and the agent will not be able to act on all of them. For example, someone surfing the web typically encounters many pages that seem worth investigating, but obviously cannot read all of them. We may assume that an agent is intrinsically capable of choice, and that this choice will be determined partly by subjective preferences, partly by situational influences, partly by chance, i.e. intrinsically unpredictable, “random” fluctuations. Therefore, it is in general impossible to determine exactly how an agent will react to a situation, although it should be possible to derive statistical regularities about the most common choices. The implication for modeling is that an agent should not be represented as a deterministic automaton, but as a stochastic system, which may make different decisions in apparently identical cases, but where it is meaningful to specify conditional probabilities for the different choices, so that in a given condition e.g. 50% of agents can be expected to make choice A, 30% choice B, and 20% choice C.
>
> One of the reasons for this unpredictability is that agents have bounded rationality: they normally never have all the information or cognitive abilities necessary to evaluate the different challenges. They, therefore have to make “informed guesses” about the best course of action to take. Moreover, assuming that similar agents tend to look for similar resources, it is worth making a choice different from the choice of the others, so as to avoid competition for scarce resources. In addition to positivity and negativity, other dimensions worth considering in order to compare challenges are:
>
> - prospect (in how far can the agent foresee the different aspects or implications of the challenge?),
>
> - difficulty (how much effort would be involved in tackling the challenge?), and
>
> - mystery (in how far would tackling this challenge increase the agent’s prospect concerning other challenges?)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "A difference between simple relaxation models and challenge models is that intelligent agents (as living or artificial systems), unlike physical systems, must remain in a far-from-equilibrium state: they are constantly active, consuming energy, and trying to avoid at all costs a complete standstill (i.e. death). Therefore, while they are inclined to relax existing challenges, they will also seek new challenges (affordances, resources, opportunities), unlike physical systems. In that sense, a “challenge relaxing” dynamics only describes part of their behavior, and must be complemented by a “challenge seeking” dynamics that is better described by some form of active exploration. This is the equivalent of what we have called positive or growth values. It is illustrated in the brain by the fact that thinking never stops: activation does not simply diffuse until it fades away; action potentials are continuously generated by the brain itself, even in the absence of outside stimuli that play the role of challenges needing to be relaxed." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The challenge seeking dynamics can be represented by the fact that the agents are constantly confronted by a variety of new challenges, and that they are motivated to pick out the most challenging one of those as soon as the previous challenge has been relaxed. These challenges have an external origin: they are produced by the agent’s environment (which includes other agents as well as the natural and technological environment). We may assume that this environment is in a constant flux, so that agents are “showered” with challenging phenomena. Each of those is an opportunity to extract valence by acting." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Challenges have been defined as “invitations” to act, which means that the agent is not forced to take up the invitation. This is necessary because in general many challenges vie for an agent’s attention, and not all can be taken up. This becomes particularly clear if we imagine a hunter-gatherer exploring a stretch of rain forest with its thousands of varied stimuli, or a person surfing the web with it millions of potentially interesting pages. The agent’s capabilities for cognitive processing and action are limited, and therefore a selection must be made between these myriads of potentially important challenges. A model of challenge propagation ideally should include a system of selection criteria and mechanisms that help the agent single out the most significant challenges—however, without assuming that there is a single most important one.
>
> Some work that may be of help here is Baars’s model of consciousness, which assumes that within the brain many stimuli and thoughts compete for attention. However, only a single one can be amplified to the degree that it comes to dominate the “global workspace” that interconnects all the more specialized brain regions. From this workspace, the thoughts selected to be most important for conscious attention are “broadcasted” to the whole brain. This model presupposes a positive feedback mechanism where strongly activated thoughts become even stronger, while suppressing weaker ones, until a single “winner” remains. This is an example of the “winner-takes-it-all” dynamic common in non-linear, self- organizing systems. The suppression requires a mechanism of neural inhibition that may use some form of negative activation.
>
> Research on attention and consciousness (see my lecture notes on “Cognitive Systems” for a review) points to unexpectedness and valence as major criteria for winning the competition: stimuli that are surprising, and/or that are highly relevant for the present goal tend to attract most attention. The valence criterion is most obvious, as challenges that promise a higher reward than others deserve more attention." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "We are left with three fundamental criteria for deciding which challenges are most worth attending to: valence, surprise, and clarity. An agent is most likely to act on a challenge that entails high value (large potential gains or losses), that is mysterious, unusual or surprising, and where there is minimal uncertainty or ambiguity about how to act. Note that the surprise/mystery and clarity criteria at first sight may appear to be opposite. However, the uncertainty implied by surprise is one about the nature of the challenge (what is its true valence?), while the certainty implied by clarity is one about the choice of action (how should I deal with this challenge?). These are not contradictory, as an uncertain challenge (e.g. a mysterious envelope left on your doorstep) may well incite a clear action (e.g. open the envelope to see what it contains). It is clear that in such a case the challenge will have a high priority even though its valence is as yet unknown: you are likely to immediately open the envelope, even though you may be disappointed to see that it contains merely some irrelevant publicity. " - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Each agent dealing with a challenge will normally extract some benefit from it, while reducing some components, and leaving some others invariant. If we focus only on the invariant components, we get a model of information transmission similar to the spreading of memes: messages are passed on from agent to agent, without undergoing much change, until they have reached everyone that may be interested in the message. This could for example be a model of the diffusion of a particular innovation, fashion, or scientific theory.
>
> If we focus on the variable components, we get a model of the self-organization of workflow and division of labor: different agents perform different tasks that are part of a common challenge, and then pass on the remaining challenge to others with different skills and/or needs, up to the point where nothing of value is left to extract, i.e. all tasks have been done. To better understand such distributed processing of a challenge we will need to investigate the dynamics of propagation from agent to agent." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "There are two paradigmatic cases of challenge propagation: stigmergy and propagation across a network. In the case of stigmergy, a challenge remains available in a public medium or workspace that all agents can access. If an agent decides to take on the challenge, it will perform some actions that change the state of the challenge and then leaves the modified challenge in the medium. At a later stage, some other agent may pick up the modified challenge, and perform some further work on it, again leaving the “traces” of its work in the medium—where it can function as a challenge for some further agent. Here, the changes in the challenge in a sense propagate in time, but not in space, as they always remain available in the same place. The medium either has a trivial topology (there is only one “place”), or its topology does not directly affect the propagation from agent to agent.
>
> The other paradigmatic case is a social or neural network, in which a challenge moves from agent to agent by following the available links in the network. Here, the topology of the network (which node is connected to which other nodes) fundamentally determines the propagation process: a challenge can move directly from agent A to agent B only if there exists a link A → B in the network. In the stigmergic case, the challenge can move from any agent X to any agent Y, without constraints. The only requirement is that Y should “visit” the shared medium some time after X deposited its modified challenge there. An Internet example of stigmergy is Wikipedia, where any person can modify any page at any stage independently of which other person has contributed to that page. An Internet example of networked propagation is email, where A can pass a challenge on to B only if A has B’s email address, and B has enough trust in A to take on challenges from A—which typically only happens if A and B have a social or organizational connection." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "As a general rule of thumb, the most interesting networks to explore will be those that are most similar in structure to the “natural” networks that we find in social networks, the Internet, or the brain. These all tend to have the following properties:
>
> - recurrent (links are directed but can form loops or cycles)
>
> - small-world (two arbitrary nodes tend to be separated by not more than a small number of links)
>
> - clustering (two neighbors of a node tend to be connected to each other)
>
> - power-law (many nodes with few links, few nodes with many links)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The connection strength of a (multi)link expresses the probability that a challenge will be successfully propagated across that link, i.e. that an agent in the output set would take up the challenge proposed by an agent in the input set. Link strength can be formalized most simply as the conditional probability P(B|A) that agent B would take on a challenge received from agent A.
>
> This probability can depend on different properties of the communicative connection between agents, including: trust (the degree to which the receiving agent takes challenges coming via the link from the sending agent seriously), power (the degree to which the sending agent can compel the sending agent to act), friendship (the degree to which the receiving agent is eager to do something for the sending agent independently of any power relationships), friction (the effort or energy that it costs to transmit the challenge across the link) and bandwidth (the detail and clarity with which information can be transmitted along the link). Link strength therefore may represent any and all of these properties." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Note that the success of the crossing (i.e. whether the receiving agent effectively addresses the challenge) depends first of all on that agent itself, that is, its selection criteria for relevance, and its capabilities for processing the challenge. The link strength merely represents the social-communicative aspect of the process, namely the relationship between sending and receiving agent determining in how far the receiving agent is likely to pay attention to the other’s challenges. If the two agents have a very weak relationship (like in two agents who don’t know each other but who both have read the same Wikipedia page), the probability of one picking up a challenge left by the other is a priori very low, and will be determined almost exclusively by the properties of the challenge and of the agents rather than by their relationship. However, this low probability may be compensated by the fact that the multilink connects a very large number of agents, so that at least one agent in the output set is likely to pick up the challenge." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The intelligence of the network could then be equated with the speed of decrease in the average length for all challenge vectors present in the network: the more quickly the network can “relax” its various challenges, the smarter it is. This now allows us to compare many different variations of the model to see which ones exhibit most intelligence. Some obvious variations to investigate are:
>

> "Offer networks can also implement a more flexible form of social governance that has been called “libertarian paternalism”, “nudging”, or “mobilization”. The principle here is that there are no absolute obligations or prohibitions: everyone has the freedom to choose from the full range of available options. However, the options are arranged in such a way that the ones that are most beneficial to society (e.g. consuming vegetables, or taking courses) become easiest, most apparent or most attractive to choose, while those that are least beneficial (e.g. consuming tobacco, junk food or fossil fuels) require some special effort or motivation to go beyond the default choice. Socially beneficial “nudging” can be achieved by adding soft constraints that represent externalities, i.e. the costs and benefits to others of a transaction between private parties. These additional constraints would affect the order or priority of the solutions suggested by the offer network. For example, a less polluting option would get a higher priority even though it may fit the request somewhat less accurately. Like all other rules in the network, both legally binding and “nudging” rules should be made public and explicit, so that anyone can scrutinize them, evaluate them, criticize them, and if necessary propose alternatives." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "First, technologies that are initially formulated in a highly abstract, technical manner eventually get implemented in an intuitive, user-friendly manner, which requires minimal effort from their users. Second, when a system becomes truly useful, people become increasingly motivated to learn to use it in the most effective way, putting in the necessary time and effort to assimilate all the tips and tricks. Third, such usage eventually becomes part of general education—just like reading and writing evolved from highly technical activities performed by a small elite of experts to general skills expected from everybody. Finally, we already alluded to the virtuous cycle of stigmergy: the partial products (such as an incomplete Wikipedia article) of some, when clearly expressed in a common medium, stimulate and guide others to add their own contributions. Thus, contributions build on top of contributions, generating an increasingly rich and sophisticated system in which everyone may eventually find what s/he needs, and where poor material is eventually replaced by better material." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Self-organization is usually a slow and difficult process that needs to overcome a variety of obstacles, given that it needs to produce global coordination out of local interactions between agents that have only a very limited perspective on the whole. This is where Internet technologies can play a crucial role. They make it in principle possible for any agent (human or artificial) to interact in real-time with any other agent, while keeping a detailed trace of such interactions and their outcomes. This makes it easier to find, select and reinforce the interactions that are most effective in tackling problems, while eliminating the less useful ones. As a result, coordination and distributed intelligence can evolve much more widely, quickly and effectively. Internet technology not only facilitates globally distributed intelligence, it makes it virtually inevitable." - [Distributed Intelligence Technologies: present and future applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-applications-survey-WS.pdf)

> "Links between systems and components are more likely to be added and reinforced than to be removed. Eventually, all systems will become interconnected, and their pattern of interconnection will become increasingly efficient, maximizing synergies while minimizing conflicts or frictions, so that information can take the most direct route from those that produce it to those that need it. That is why there is a continuing trend for all information technologies to merge into one giant distributed intelligence." - [Distributed Intelligence Technologies: present and future applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-applications-survey-WS.pdf)

> "One of the reasons for the popularity of Internet communities and social media is precisely that they make it easy for people to get recognition for their contributions from peers, thus allowing them to build up a good reputation. The popularity of games, on the other hand, is due for an important part to the fact that they provide immediate feedback about the actions performed by the player, in the form or points, scores, and awards. This creates a sense of achievement, as players can graduate into increasingly advanced “levels” of expertise in the game. While these gaming applications may seem rather frivolous, the underlying psychological mechanism of flow makes a real contribution to people’s level of happiness. Moreover, this mechanism can be extended by techniques such as “gamification” to tasks that are very serious indeed, such as studying mathematics, or increasing fitness. The concept of mobilization system refers to a new type of DIT that encourages and helps people to work towards a worthwhile objective, thus boosting their sense of achievement." - [Distributed Intelligence Technologies: present and future applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-applications-survey-WS.pdf)

> "A worldview gives meaning to our life, and helps us to understand the world around us. A coherent worldview is particularly important in the current era of accelerating scientific, cultural and social developments, in which all the old certainties are put into question. The confusion and fragmentation associated with this contribute to alienation, pessimism and uncertainty, and the need for psychological guidance in the form of a clear and reliable system of thought. Unfortunately such a framework is all too often found in fundamentalist ideologies, or in irrational beliefs and superstitions. Science should be our weapon in the fight against irrationality and fundamentalism. Regrettably, contemporary science seems to contribute to the confusion by the avalanche of often-contradictory observations and theories that it overloads us with. That is why we need to develop a coherent, new worldview that is solidly rooted in the most advanced scientific concepts and observations, but that goes beyond the simple-minded determinism and reductionism of Newtonian science in order to bring us back a sense of meaning, of purpose, of being part of a larger whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "We can promote coordination between agents by providing them with an adequate medium. A good example of such a medium is a wiki-style website, which can be edited and added to by a variety of independent individuals. Creating such stigmergic interaction medium is an example of what we call design for self-organization: conceiving and realizing a structure that does not so much tell the agents what they should do, but that helps them find out for themselves what is the most effective way to act in a coordinated, synergetic manner. In self-organization there is no centralized control, no separable agent that directs the actions of the others. Instead, coordinated activity emerges in a distributed manner, out of the tangle of interactions between largely autonomous agents." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "The support structure we are aiming for may be called a mobilization system. Its aim is to encourage and organize people to work towards a common goal. This is particularly useful in our present society that suffers from complexity, fragmentation and information overload, with the result that people have lost a clear sense of goals and values, and often fail to see the forest for the trees. There are presently so many issues that clamor for our attention that we often do not know anymore what to focus on, but instead jump from the one thing to the next without giving anything the attention it deserves, or simply procrastinate and wait for things to be imposed from the outside. A mobilization system would combat this confused and unproductive way of acting by redirecting effort in the most efficient way at the most important issues. This requires the following steps:
>
> a) Helping people to reach consensus about the specific goals that they consider most important. This can be done in part by seeking inspiration about fundamental values in the evolutionary worldview, in part by creating effective discussion systems that help a group to come to a well-reasoned consensus...
>
> b) Motivating and stimulating people to work towards the goals that have thus been agreed upon. Here, a very useful paradigm is the concept of “flow”, which specifies the conditions under which people work in the most focused and motivated manner. These conditions are:
>
>   a1) Clear goals: there should be minimal ambiguity about what to do next;
>
>   a2) Immediate feedback: any action should be followed by an easily interpretable result, so that you either get a confirmation that you are on the right track, or a warning that you need to correct your course;
>
>   a3) Challenges in balance with skills: tasks should be neither too difficult nor too easy for the people entrusted to perform them, in order to avoid either stress or boredom.
>
> Additionally, there exists a wide range of techniques from psychology, behavioral economics and memetics that help us to formulate goals and tasks in a way that is maximally motivating, persuasive and easy to follow.

> "The “stigmergic university” system we envisage would contain at least the following components:
>
> - A website that represents knowledge in the form of a conceptual network. Each concept would be explained by a document containing a definition, further explanation, examples, and links with connected concepts. This was the original conception behind the Principia Cybernetica Project. Similar to Wikipedia, users of the systems would be able to edit the text and to create new concept pages. Unlike Wikipedia, concepts would be linked as much as possible using formally labeled connections, so that the knowledge would have the shape of a semantic and associative network rather than an unstructured encyclopedia.
>
> - A set of programs to analyze the structure of this formal network. This module would be able to pinpoint ambiguous, missing, inconsistent, or redundant information, and to suggest ways to improve the network, e.g. by proposing additional links, changing the types of links, or new, higher-order categories that cluster a number of related concepts together. This is the basic “research support” module, which helps individual researchers to discover and resolve the remaining gaps in their understanding.
>
> - A discussion module that would support reaching consensus about as yet unresolved issues, not only via traditional free-form “forums”, but via structured networks of arguments and counterarguments. Here, the systems’ analysis of the network would help the users to identify the weakest arguments, thus stimulating their authors to either change their position, or propose better arguments to defend it. This module further supports research, but now at the level of the dialogue between researchers who have different perspectives on the issue.
>
> - An educational subnetwork of “guided tours” or paths within the conceptual network, functioning as suggested sequences for learners to study the knowledge that start from easier concepts and build up towards more advanced ones depending on the interests of the learner. This would help a student to quickly advance into a complex knowledge domain without getting confused by the variety and complexity of the knowledge that is available. To make this most effective, the guidance should be adapted individually to the interests and skills of each student. This can be achieved with the following assessment module. Moreover, the system would learn from the way it is being used, so that later students would get recommendations that take into account the experiences of previous students.
>
> - A system that generates questions about the knowledge in the network. Most of these questions should be easy to answer by someone who knows the domain, and thus could be used to test the knowledge of the users. This is the module for teaching and assessment on the basis of “inverted learning”. The procedure starts by asking the users a question in order to stimulate or challenge them to reflect about the domain. It then gives them the right answer on the basis of what is contained in the knowledge base (feedback). Depending on how well a user scores on different parts of the curriculum, the system would recommend a further study of particular parts of the knowledge network, thus acting as a kind of tutor to a student. When a question does not have a satisfactory answer within the knowledge base or the user disagrees with the answer that is offered, the user will be stimulated to mark out and—ideally— resolve this knowledge gap. This connects the teaching and assessment module to the research module: depending on how easy or ambiguous the question is, answering it can be more a questions of assessment of existing knowledge or of stimulating the creation of new knowledge.
>
> Like Wikipedia, such a knowledge network should be able to grow indefinitely, so as to encompass all the relevant knowledge about a particular domain. Moreover, the system would automate the social and organizational functions of a university by stimulating users to develop their knowledge, assessing their progress, giving them feedback about how well they are doing, proposing concrete goals for their next study or research, and thus mobilizing and coordinating their cognitive efforts as efficiently as possible towards an ever increasing understanding of the domain. If such a system were deployed at a global level, like Wikipedia, it would provide an invaluable aid to the cognitive development of the world population." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Regulation (or control): the process by which an agent continually neutralizes deviations from its goals, by effectively counteracting disturbances. Regulation implements negative feedback: deviations in one direction are compensated by reactions that push the state in the opposite direction, so as to reduce their effect. The classic example of regulation is the functioning of a thermostat, which switches on the heating as soon as the temperature moves below its set temperature or goal, and switches off the heating as soon as the temperature moves above the goal temperature." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Navigation: the process by which an agent constantly adjusts its course of action so as to dynamically maximize its advance in utility while taking into account the diversions it encounter. This means that the agent should optimally allocate its effort in simultaneously counteracting disturbances (regulation), finding affordances (exploration), and making use of the affordances it has found (exploitation). Navigating means that the agent needs to set out a well-thought out, but flexible course, using a combination of planning (to deal with known disturbances and affordances) and improvisation (to deal with new diversions)." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Variety of action: the number of actions that an agent can potentially execute. The larger an agent’s variety of action, the larger the variety of diversions that the agent can deal with, because different types of diversions typically require different types of actions. This is a generalization of Ashby’s well-known “law of requisite variety”. However, while increasing the variety of actions makes the agent potentially more powerful in achieving its goals, it also makes it more difficult for the agent to select the most appropriate action." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Cognition: the acquisition, processing, storage, and use of information and knowledge to support intelligent decision-making. This includes perception (the processing and interpretation of incoming information), learning (extracting recurrent regularities from perceptions and storing them into memory in the form of knowledge), and inference (using stored knowledge patterns to anticipate situations as yet not perceived)." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Rationality: the hypothetical desire and ability of an agent to always choose the best action. In reality, rationality is restricted or bounded, as an agent never has enough information, knowledge or intelligence to accurately determine the utility of all possible courses of action. Bounded rationality implies that there is always an element of uncertainty or trial-and-error involved in making decisions; no decision can be a priori proven to be the best one." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Collective intelligence: the degree to which the agents in a system collectively can make good decisions as to their future course of action; in particular, the degree to which the agents collectively can make better decisions than any of them individually. Collective intelligence typically arises from the pooling of knowledge: since each agent’s knowledge is slightly different from the knowledge of the others, all agents together will have access to a larger pool of more diverse knowledge. Therefore, collective intelligence can be amplified by increasing the diversity of knowledge among the agents." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Distributed cognition: the acquisition, storage and use of information and knowledge distributed over different agents in a system, so as to support their collective intelligence. This requires mechanisms to communicate information across the different agents in a coordinated manner, so that the right information is gathered at the right place at the right time. Examples of such supporting mechanisms for the exchange of information are pheromones (smell signals), language, books, signs, computers and the Internet." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Coordination: the arrangement or mutual alignment of actions so as to maximize synergy and minimize friction in their overall pattern of activity. It implies that any two actions performed simultaneously or subsequently are selected so as to maximally complement and minimally obstruct each other. This requires a minimization of the uncertainty that otherwise would dissipate resources in needless trial-and-error, and therefore the imposition of appropriate constraints or bonds that drive the action in the right direction. There are two types of basic relational constraints between actions: parallel, specifying which actions could or should go on simultaneously, and sequential, specifying which action could or should follow which other action." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Self-organization: the spontaneous emergence or evolution of coordination in a complex adaptive system. Self-organization reduces variety or uncertainty, and thus imposes constraint. The driving force behind self-organization is the co-evolution or mutual adaptation between the different agents in the system: actions and reactions produce a continuously changing configuration of interactions (variation); however, the more synergetic a configuration, the more "satisfied" the agents will be with the situation, and thus the less they will act to produce further changes (selective retention or preference for synergetic configurations); vice versa, the more friction there is, the more the agents will be pressured to intervene and change course in order to increase their utility (elimination of high friction configurations). Thus, self-organization is merely an application of the evolutionary dynamic of variation (because of actions triggering further actions) and natural selection (because of the implicit preference of agents for the more synergetic patterns of action)." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Organization: a stabilized network of interactions between agents that functions to ensure the coordination of their actions. This structure specifies the specific roles of and interactions between the system's agents. Its function is to maximize synergy and minimize friction (including transaction costs) in their further interactions. For example, in a human organization the different individuals each have their own responsibilities, and the rules of the organization specify who interacts with whom in what way. This minimizes transaction costs, since it is no longer necessary to search for partners, negotiate with them, or strictly monitor whether they do what they are expected to do. An organization can be imposed from the outside (like in a system engineered by a designer or controlled by a manager), or emerge from self-organization." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Stigmergy: a form of indirect coordination via the medium, where the trace left by an action in the medium stimulates the performance of a subsequent action, thus building further on the work that has already been done. Examples of stigmergic interaction are termites collectively building a termite hill by adding mud to heaps left by other termites, ants mapping out their territory by leaving trails of pheromone that lead other ants to food sources, and people adding their insights to the writings of others, thus collaboratively developing an encyclopedia (Wikipedia) on the web. Stigmergy is typically the result of the self-organization of a mediator out of the medium. It is probably the simplest way to achieve coordination in a complex system because it does not make any cognitive demands on the agents (such as remembering who is to do what when), and therefore functions even with agents of very low intelligence, such as insects. It also does not require any relationship, communication or even direct interaction between the agents: contributors to a Wikipedia page typically have no idea who the other contributors are, yet their contributions are seamlessly integrated into the emerging whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Evolution of cooperation: the general tendency for interactions to become more synergetic through variation and selection, thus reducing competition and conflict. The biggest obstacle to the evolution of cooperation is the problem of “free riders”: agents that profit from the collaborative effort of other agents but without contributing themselves. Since free riders typically extract more benefit from the cooperation than the cooperators themselves, they risk outcompeting the cooperators, thus destroying any tendency to cooperation. This problem can be overcome via the evolution of a mediator that makes free riding impossible, or at least less attractive than true cooperation." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "According to some estimates, in our present economic system more than half of economic value generated is lost to transaction costs. A fundamental source of transaction costs is uncertainty: since the agent does not know what transaction to enter into, what to agree upon, or what to expect, it will need to spend a lot of energy in search, negotiation, and enforcement of agreements." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "The potential for theoretical explanation and practical application of the stigmergy concept is much larger still than hitherto assumed. What (Parunak, 2006) noted about human institutions, that the more difficult issue is to find examples where stigmergy does not apply, extends to complex systems in general, and in particular to systems that exhibit some form of cognition, cooperation, or organization that is the result of evolution. When properly defined, the mechanism of stigmergy appears to be nearly ubiquitous, and able to illuminate a variety of conceptual problems in a non-trivial manner." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

As we will show, stigmergy is just as important for understanding the behavior of a single individual." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Compared to traditional methods of organization, stigmergy makes absolutely minimal demands on the agents. In particular, in stigmergic collaboration there is no need for:
>
> • planning or anticipation: agents only need to know the present state of the activity; the overall goal, next step or end result is irrelevant for their present work. In Wikipedia, there is no plan specifying which information should be added to the encyclopedia when.
>
> • memory: agents do not need to remember their previous activity; no information about the state of the work needs to be stored anywhere except in the medium.
>
> • communication: no information needs to be transferred between the agents, except via the work done in the medium; there is in particular no need for the agents to negotiate about who does what.
>
> • mutual awareness: each agent works independently; it does not even need to know that others participate. For example, contributors to Wikipedia generally do not know each other or communicate with each other.
>
> • simultaneous presence: there is in general no need for the agents to be present at the same time or at the same place; tasks are registered in the medium so that they can be picked up by agents whenever and wherever they are available. That is how worldwide communities can collaborate on a single software project.
>
> • imposed sequence: actions are performed automatically in the right order, since an action will not be started until the right condition is in place; the workflow emerges spontaneously, as the completion of one task triggers the initiation of the next task(s)
>
> • imposed division of labor: each agent will only perform the actions for which it has the required competence, i.e. for which it possesses adequate condition-action rules; normally, the more “confident” the agent is about the right action (i.e. the stronger the connection between condition and action), the more it will be stimulated by the condition, and the quicker it will be to start the job; in this way, tasks are automatically assigned to the most competent agents
>
> • commitment: agents do no need to commit to a particular task (in contradiction to what (Jennings, 1993) claims about multi-agent coordination); an agent decides on the spot what work it should do, depending on opportunity and other contingent conditions; an agent that quits or otherwise becomes unavailable is automatically replaced by another one
>
> • centralized control or supervision: errors or perturbations are automatically corrected, as they merely create a new condition stimulating new actions to deal with the challenge; the activity is self-organizing: global organization emerges from local interactions, without any centralized control directing the activity. For example, bugs in open-source software are spotted by users, and resolved by other contributors." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Stigmergy exhibits another fundamental “signature” of self-organization: positive feedback. Error-controlled regulation assumes negative feedback: the reduction of deviations away from the goal. However, goal-directed action can also make use of positive feedback: the amplification of movements towards the goal." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The number of agents collaborating on a stigmergic project is actually much less fundamental than it may seem. The essence of the activity is always the same. Assuming that the agents have the same competencies, adding more agents merely increases manpower and therefore the size of the problem that can be tackled, the speed of advance, or the eventual magnitude of the achievement. Only when the agents are diverse can an increase in their number produce a qualitative improvement in the solution.
>
> The only complication added is that agents may get in each other's way, in the sense that similar individuals perceiving the same stimulus are likely to move to the same place at the same time, thus obstructing each other's actions. This problem is easily tackled by an additional rule, which is already implicit in individual work but likely to become reinforced during collaborative work: keep a minimum distance from obstacles— including other agents. This rule is a well-known ingredient in the many successful simulations of collectively moving animals, such as flocks, schools or swarms, allowing densely packed groups of agents to follow complex, synchronized trajectories without ever bumping into each other." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Quantitative vs. qualitative stigmergy:
>
> Quantitative stigmergy refers to perceived conditions that differ in strength or degree, and where stronger traces typically elicit more forceful (intense, frequent, …) actions. This quantitative variation is perhaps best captured using my definition of stimulation in terms of conditional probability: the stronger the trace, the larger the probability of a certain action given that trace. Over an extended period, higher probability implies more frequent actions by more numerous agents, and therefore more intense overall activity. The two paradigmatic cases of stigmergy, termite nest-building and ant trail-laying, follow this quantitative logic. The higher the emerging heap of mud (stronger trace), the more an individual termite is attracted to it, and therefore the larger the probability or frequency of mud being added. The stronger the scent of pheromone on a trail, the less likely an ant is to deviate from that trail, and therefore the higher the probability that it too will reinforce the trail with additional pheromone. These are typical examples of the positive feedback that efficiently amplifies positive developments.
>
> But quantitative stigmergy can also be exemplified by negative feedback, where a stronger trace leads to less activity. A human example can be found in the market mechanism. Extensive buying of a good (action) reduces the supply and thus increases the price, which is a quantitative trace left by the collective buying and selling activity. A higher price will normally reduce the probability that someone would buy additional stock of that good (negative stimulation). Thus, a higher price reduces demand, which in turn will reduce the price. This mechanism of self-organizing, distributed control implements the “invisible hand” of the market. It stabilizes prices and efficiently allocates production capacity to the goods that are most in demand.
>
> Qualitative stigmergy refers to conditions and actions that differ in kind rather than in degree. In this case, a different trace stimulates a different type of action. An example can be found in the different stages of the building of a funnel-shaped nest by the solitary wasp that we discussed, where each stage requires a particular type of building action. A human example can be found in “wiki” websites that are edited by their own readers. A paragraph that contains a semantic mistake (e.g. in the definition of a word) will elicit a corrective action (e.g. writing a new definition). Different types of errors, vagueness, or lack of information will stimulate different types of additions and corrections." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "This type of indirect stimulation, not by the work itself but by a specially evolved “side-effect”, has been called marker-based stigmergy. The evolution of markers is an obvious method to make stigmergy more efficient, by more reliably focusing the agents' attention on the most relevant aspects of the work that needs to be done. However, it entails an extra cost and complication in that individuals need to perform the task of manufacturing markers in addition to the work itself. A human example can be found in the Wikipedia encyclopedia on the web. Readers are stimulated to improve existing pages either directly, by reading the text and noticing its shortcomings, or indirectly, by reading comments that summarize the tasks that still need to be done—such as adding references, clarifying ambiguous sections, or checking facts. The direct method exemplifies sematectonic stigmergy, the indirect one marker-based stigmergy. The “markers” in this case are the various “to do” notes that attract the attention to the problems that still require work. A marker can be seen as an abstract, conventional sign, intentionally representing the work to be done instead of mechanically registering its effects. In Peirce's semiotic taxonomy of signs, a marker is a symbol, while a sematectonic trace is an index. As such, a marker may seem to belong to a higher-order semiotic or communicative category of phenomena—a “meta-level” compared to the “object level” of the work itself. However, as in all phenomena produced by evolution, there is an essential continuity between the more primitive and the more “advanced” versions." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "This is the same phenomenon of selective “forgetting” that characterizes memory in the brain: neural connections that are no longer reinforced will gradually lose their strength relative to recently reinforced ones. The speed of this forgetting depends on the learning parameter, as defined in neural networks. A large value of the parameter means that new changes in connection strength are large relative to the cumulative effect of previous ones, thus promoting the speedy establishment of new memory traces—but also the quick obsolescence of older traces. A small value, on the other hand, means that older learning episodes continue to exert a strong effect. A similar parameter probably controls the external memory of ants as laid down in pheromone trails: newly added pheromone should be strong enough to allow trails towards newly found food sources to eventually become more attractive than previously found ones; yet, it should not be so strong that some recent journeys by ants carrying food from a new, unproven source can overpower the signals pointing to an older source whose reliability is evidenced by hundreds of successful journeys. Given that what counts is the relative attractiveness of different options for action, the “learning” parameter, which determines the intensity of new contributions to the trace, is in practice equivalent to a “forgetting” parameter, which determines the rate of decay of the existing trace. The optimal value of this parameter will depend on the speed with which information becomes obsolete." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "No sharp distinction can be made between persistent and transient traces used in stigmergy: these are merely the opposite ends of a continuum. Yet, the distinction may be useful for conceptual clarification. Persistent traces lead to what may be called asynchronous stigmergy: the different agents or productions do not need to be present at the same time, since the trace remains to guide them at any later time. Asynchronous communication can be illustrated by media such as print, email, or websites. Its advantage is that information remains available, so that it can be processed at the most appropriate occasion, and can accumulate and mature over the longer term. Transient traces lead to synchronous stigmergy: the agents need to be simultaneously present for the coordination to succeed.
>
> Synchronous communication may be exemplified by media such as telephone and Internet “chat”. Its advantage is that interaction, and therefore feedback, is instantaneous, so that disturbances and coordination errors can be corrected without delay. Synchronous communication is rarely conceived as stigmergic, since it is typically used for direct interaction, such as conversation or discussion. Yet, a warning cry or a chemical signal exemplify indirect interaction: they are targeted at no one in particular but merely “released” in the medium. Examples of stigmergy in synchronous interaction are even clearer when the signal is sematectonic. For example, a bird spotting a danger (condition) will start to fly (action), and by this example (transient trace) set off the whole flock to fly away (subsequent action). Synchronous stigmergy may be best exemplified by the collective movement in herds, flocks or swarms, where the agents are continually adjusting their trajectory on the basis of real-time perceptions of the movements of other agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "A one-dimensional, quantitative aspect: the range or scope of the stigmergic process. The scope represents the size of the “neighborhood” across which a stigmergic signal is perceivable. The two poles of the scope continuum may be called broadcast and narrowcast. Broadcasted traces can be perceived by all agents involved. Narrowcasted traces are perceivable by only one or a few agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The situation becomes more complex—but also more interesting—when different actions or agents have a different scope, so that A's traces e.g. may reach B, C and D, while D's traces reach B and E. In this case, the topology of the stigmergic medium becomes equivalent to a network where different nodes (A, B, C…) each are connected to (i.e. can deposit traces perceivable by) different other nodes. The implication is that the network paradigm—which is increasingly popular for modeling various complex and self-organizing systems such as neural networks, social networks, citation networks, etc.—could be viewed as a special case of the stigmergic paradigm, albeit a rather complicated one." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Next to its general function of coordination, stigmergy in particular supports cognition and cooperation. Traditionally, cognition has been viewed as the processing of information inside the brain. More recent approaches, however, note that both the information and the processing often reside in the outside world—or what we have called the medium. For example, documents function as an external memory for storing knowledge and data, while calculations are typically performed on a piece of paper or on a calculator. Without such supporting media, most advanced reasoning—as performed e.g. in science and technology—would be simply impossible. Thus, the human mind extends into the environment, “outsourcing” some of its functions to external support systems. The reason is that our memory and information processing capabilities have rather strict limitations—most famously the “magical number 7 plus or minus 2” which denotes the maximum number of items we can hold in short-term memory. Books and computers are relatively recent inventions. However, the use of an external medium for supporting cognition is probably as old as cognition itself. More precisely, our mental capabilities can be seen as an interiorization of what were initially stigmergic interactions with the environment." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "In the stigmergic paradigm, the common good (e.g. Wikipedia, or a network of trails and roads connecting common destinations) is gradually built up via the cooperation implicit in stigmergically coordinated actions. Free riders may profit from this common good without putting in any effort in return. However, the benefit derived from a stigmergic trace does not in general reduce the value of that trace. For example, an ant that follows a pheromone trace laid by others without adding pheromone of its own does not by that action make the pheromone trace less useful to the other ants. Similarly, a person who downloads a piece of open source software without contributing to the development of that software does not impose any burden on the software developers. Thus, in a situation of stigmergy, a free rider or “defector” does not weaken the cooperators, in contrast to situations like the Prisoners’ dilemma or Tragedy of the Commons.
>
> In a sense, by not contributing the free riding agent merely weakens its own position, because it passes by the opportunity to adapt the trace to its own preferences. As we saw, the stigmergic trace is the aggregate of many independent actions, each of which helps the agent that performed it to achieve its goals. The ant that finds food but does not leave a pheromone trace on its way back to the nest not only does not help others to get to that food: it also does not help itself, because without the trace it is very unlikely to find the same food source again. The trace is both an individual and a collective “mental map” that indicates effective actions. Not leaving a trace makes your own future work harder than it needs to be." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "In the short run, the free rider may seem to have the benefit over the cooperator of spending less energy establishing and maintaining the trace. However, the cooperator collects other benefits. First, as we noted with the ant leaving pheromone or the hiker breaking off branches, the cooperating agent helps itself by creating a trace. Second, the stigmergic interaction will boost the benefits of that individual trace by stimulating others to expand on it. For example, an ant creating a trail to a new food source will incite others to explore the neighborhood of that source, potentially discovering even better sources or shorter trails. Similarly, the hiker who partially cleared a path will thus increase the probability of others following that same path while performing further clearing themselves. This is the positive feedback of actions eliciting more actions that makes stigmergy so effective. The free rider simply misses out on this potential amplification of its actions." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Virtually all evolved processes that require coordination between actions rely at some level on stigmergy, in the sense that subsequent actions are stimulated by the trace left by previous actions in some observable and manipulable medium. The trace functions like a registry and map, indicating which actions have been performed and which still need to be performed. It is shared by all agents that have access to the medium, thus allowing them to coordinate their actions without need for agent-to-agent communication. It also allows individual agents to perform complex sequences of actions without need for a memory or plan that keeps track of which action needs to be performed when...
>
> Stigmergy can be seen as a fundamental mechanism of self-organization: it allows global, coordinated activity to emerge out of local, independent actions. Like self- organization in general, stigmergy relies on feedback: action elicits action, via the intermediary of the trace. This feedback is typically positive, in that actions intensify and elaborate the trace, thus eliciting more intense and diverse further actions. The resulting virtuous cycle explains in part why stigmergic organization is so surprisingly effective, enabling the construction of complex structures—such as a termite hill, a network of trails, or a world encyclopedia—in a very short time, even when starting from scratch. When necessary, feedback can also be negative: errors, disturbances or “overshoots” that make the trace deviate from its ideal shape will elicit actions that correct the deviation.
>
> We have examined different variations on this theme by distinguishing basic aspects or dimensions in which the process can vary. The number of agents involved turns out to be less fundamental than is generally assumed. Increasing that number will qualitatively enhance the result only if the agents are sufficiently diverse in the actions they contribute, yet sufficiently aligned in their strategies so that they do not hinder each other. Like the number of agents, the difference between qualitative and quantitative stigmergy does not seem essential, given that the notion of “stimulation” entails a quantitative aspect of intensity or probability, while the actions that are stimulated more or less intensively differ qualitatively. The difference between sematectonic traces—the concrete, observable results of work performed—and markers—traces left to guide subsequent actions, but without contributing to the work itself—is important but subtle. The use of markers allows a more fine-grained control of stigmergic coordination, but demands an advanced level of collective evolution, in which certain traces have acquired a conventional meaning among the agents that use them. The transience of the trace is crucial in order to ensure that the list of “to do’s” remains up to date: in a quickly changing environment, actions need to adapt in time to new circumstances, which means that an outdated trace should decay before it would elicit too much useless activity; in a more stable environment, on the other hand, persistent traces enable the accumulation of a long and detailed memory. A final dimension of variation, the broadcast-narrowcast continuum, is as yet insufficiently investigated. Nevertheless, it hints at an essential continuity between stigmergic mechanisms of self-organization (using a typically broadcasted trace) and the better-known, local interaction mechanisms, where the result of an action only affects linked or neighboring agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "According to coordination theory, we can distinguish the following fundamental dependencies or connections between actions or processes:
>
> 1) one action can be prerequisite for the next action: the product or output of the first is a necessary condition or input for the second. This determines the sequential organization of the process, or workflow, where activity moves step-by-step through a sequence of tasks (what needs to be done next?).
>
> 2) two actions can require the same condition (input) and/or contribute to the same effect or goal (output), i.e. they are performed in parallel. This determines the allocation of resources (who receives what?) and the division of labor between agents (who is to do what?).

Another issue is non- collaborativeness. Idea-sharing sites tend to elicit many fairly simple ideas. The ideas generated by the google project, for example, (e.g. make government more transparent, help social entrepreneurs, support public transport, create user-generated news services) were in large part not novel and light on detail. Surely that massive amount of effort could have been used to compose a smaller number of more deeply-considered ideas, but idea-sharing sites provide little support (or incentive) for this, because people can not collaboratively refine submitted ideas." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> The simple argument map scheme we use represents a tradeoff between expressiveness and ease-of-use. It does not formally capture, for example, such concepts as:
>
> • Inter-dependencies: often the solution to a complex problem consists of a package of component solutions that have to fit together well for the complete solution to be a good one. This could be handled, for example, by having ideas that consist of packages of other ideas, along with “fits with” links between these component ideas to which we can attach pro and con arguments.
>
> • Relative valuations: often people wish to discuss the relative, rather than the absolute merits of ideas (e.g. “carbon tax is better than cap-and-trade because …”). This could be handled by having “better than” links between ideas that can in turn be linked to pro and con arguments.
>
> • Warrants vs antecedents: the current formalism doesn’t allow one to deliberate separately about the antecedents and warrant for an argument. If someone claims, for example, that “global warming is bunk because the weather was cold today”, you can’t argue for or against the warrant (i.e. “a cold day debunks global warming”) separately from the antecedent (“today was a cold day”). This could be handled by allowing one to attach arguments to the links between other arguments, or (equivalently) by being able to specify when the children of an argument have a conjunctive semantics as opposed to the default disjunctive semantics.

> We have experimented with extending our formalism to cover these cases, but our experience to date has been that every additional bit of formal complexity seems to substantially increase the possibility for user confusion, and therefore represents a potential barrier to widespread participation.

> "A set of community conventions (similar to those that underlie other social computing systems like Wikipedia and Slashdot) help ensure that the argument map is well-organized. Each post should represent a single issue, idea, pro, or con, should not replicate a point that has been made elsewhere in the argument map, and should be attached to the post it logically refers to. A central tenet is the “live and let live” rule: if one disagrees with an idea or argument, the user should not change that post to undermine it, but should rather create new posts that present their alternative ideas or counter-arguments. Every individual can thus present their own point of view, using the strongest arguments they can muster, without fear of sabotage by anyone else. This process is supported by capabilities that have proven invaluable in other social computing systems, including rating (to help the community encourage and identify important issues, ideas and arguments), watchlists (which automatically notify users of changes to posts they have registered interest in), version histories (to allow users to roll-back an post to a previous version if it has been “damaged” by an edit), and home pages (which allows users to develop an online presence). The system also provides multiple forms of social translucence (i.e. visual cues concerning who is doing what in the system), thereby fostering a sense of belonging as well as enabling self-organized attention mediation by the community...
>
> Because good argument-mapping skills are not universal, moderators help ensure that new posts are correctly structured. Their job is part education, and part quality control. Posts, when initially created, are given a “pending” status and can only be viewed by other authors. If a post doesn’t adequately follow the argument map conventions, moderators will either fix it or leave comments explaining what needs to be done. Once a moderator has verified that a post follows the conventions, the post is “certified” and becomes available to be viewed, edited, commented on, or rated by the general user population. The certification process helps ensures well- structured maps, and provides incentives for users to learn the argument formalism. Moderators serve a relatively modest role in all this: their role is not to evaluate the merits of a post, but simply to work with authors to ensure that the content is structured in a way that maximizes its utility to the community at large.
>
> We estimate, based on our experience to date, that there needs to be about 1 moderator for every 20 active authors, to ensure that posts are checked and certified in a timely fashion without undue burden on each moderator. This figure is well within the bounds of the percentage of “power users” that are a common feature of social computing systems. Experienced authors, with a track record of successful argument map creation, can be selected to join the moderator pool. There is already, in addition, a substantial world-wide community of people with argument mapping skills. One organization alone (cognexus.org) has trained and certified hundreds of people on argument mapping techniques. Argument mapping is, in addition, a natural skill for lawyers, philosophers, mathematicians, library scientists, debaters, and others who frequently create taxonomies, arguments or proofs. Such individuals may be inspired by the opportunity to contribute their skills to deliberations about complex critical challenges, even if they do not have substantial content expertise in that area.
>
> While this has not happened in our evaluations to date, it is of course possible that moderators may undercut the deliberations by imposing their own biases when deciding which posts to certify. There are many ways to address this concern. For example, moderators can double-check each others’ decisions, especially when authors complain that a post of theirs was inappropriately left uncertified. We can also provide a moderator rating system so that the user community can identify consistently poor moderators, plus a voting process for deciding when to remove moderator privileges from such individuals. Such a “meta-moderation” model has worked successfully with such systems as Wikipedia and Slashdot.

> Another potential problem is that the community’s understanding of a topic may shift, so that the initial formulation of the deliberation (as captured by the set of key issues being discussed) may need to change after considerable effort has been invested deliberating about the old set of issues. At worse, all affected posts might have to be de-certified and go through a new certification process to make sure they get fit properly into the new structure. This has also not happened in our evaluations to date – the core questions have been clear-cut from the start - but it does suggest that the participants in a deliberation should frame the “skeleton” of initial issues carefully so this problem can be avoided as much as possible." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> The larger the user community, therefore, the more potential redundancy there is, and thus the more value argument mapping offers in terms of improving the signal to noise ratio. There is widespread disaffection with the low signal-to-noise ratio of current social media tools. We can thus expect that, as the scale of the discussion grows, users will increasingly recognize the opportunity to “become a hero” by contributing something (i.e. creating a value-rich deliberation map) that is highly valued by the community. Argument mapping also increases user’s chances of “finding their tribe”. While contributing to unstructured discussions is easier, the high volume and redundancy of such discussions means that most posts will probably be overlooked by most readers. In an argument map, by contrast, if you have a unique point to make, it has a muchgreater chance of being seen. We can thus expect the benefits of argument mapping, to a contributor, will increase rapidly with the size of the user community.

Remember that a deliberation map is structured like a tree.

If the average branching factor (number of sub-branches per branch) of a tree is N, then the average number of steps needed to locate a post is no more than the Nth logarithm of the tree size...

> Technological and process refinements can further improve this picture by reducing authoring and moderation costs. One option, for example, is “wisdom of the crowds” moderation, wherein the full user community, performing simplified moderation “micro-tasks”, substitutes for a relatively small cadre of expert moderators. There is good reason to believe that such an approach can work. It has been shown many times that large numbers of people with even modest skills can, in the aggregate, perform judgment tasks better than experts. It has also been shown, by such systems as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, that large number of people are willing to perform such micro-tasks cheaply, or even for free if they believe in the project.

> While these results are promising, our work has led us to conclude that, to fully realize argumentation technology’s potential for supporting large-scale deliberations, we need to address the critical challenge of attention allocation. For the kinds of topics that most require large-scale deliberation, even a user community of moderate size can quickly generate large and rapidly growing argument maps. How can we help users identify the portions of the map that can best benefit from their contributions, in maps with hundreds or thousands of posts? How can the stakeholders assess whether the deliberations are progressing well, whether some intervention is needed to help the deliberations work more effectively, and when the results are mature and ready to “harvest”? Can we foster, for large-scale deliberations, the understanding that participants in small-scale discussions typically have about where the discussion has gone, what remains to be addressed, and where they can best contribute. Without this kind of big picture, we run the risk of severely under-utilizing the collective intelligence potentially provided by large- scale social media." - [Enabling Large-Scale Deliberation Using Attention-Mediation Metrics, by Mark Klein](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228319392_Enabling_Large-Scale_Deliberation_Using_Attention-Mediation_Metrics)

> "I believe that all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and that these principles now apply to capitalism. While the pursuit of profit is usually an effective motivator and resource allocator for creating productivity and for providing those who are productive with buying power, it is now producing a self-reinforcing feedback loop that widens the income/wealth/opportunity gap to the point that capitalism and the American Dream are in jeopardy. That is because capitalism is now working in a way in which people and companies find it profitable to have policies and make technologies that lessen their people costs, which lessens a large percentage of the population’s share of society’s resources. Those companies and people who are richer have greater buying power, which motivates those who seek profit to shift their resources to produce what the haves want relative to what the have-nots want, which includes fundamentally required things like good care and education for the have-not children... As a result of this dynamic, the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

> "Not spending money on educating our children well might be good from a budget perspective, but it’s really stupid from an investment perspective. Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesn’t lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic picture—e.g., it doesn’t take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good “double bottom line” return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns)." - [Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed, by Ray Dalio](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/)

> "Variation and selection automatically produce differentiation (variety) and integration (dependency), for living as well as non-living systems. Structural complexification is produced by spatial differentiation and the selection of fit linkages between components. Functional complexification follows from the need to increase the variety of actions in order to cope with more diverse environmental perturbations, and the need to integrate actions into higher-order complexes in order to minimize the difficulty of decision-making. Both processes produce a hierarchy of nested supersystems or metasystems, and tend to be self-reinforcing. Though simplicity is a selective factor, it does not tend to arrest or reverse overall complexification. Increase in the absolute components of fitness, which is associated with complexification, defines a preferred direction for evolution, although the process remains wholly unpredictable." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "The maintenance of an invariant configuration in spite of variable disturbances defines the problem of homeostasis. As studied in cybernetics (Ashby, 1962), homeostasis can be achieved by control, i.e. the compensation of perturbations by the appropriate counteractions so that a desired goal is reached or maintained... Ashby's (1958, 1962) Law of Requisite Variety states that in order to achieve control, the variety of actions a control system is able to execute must be at least as great as the variety of environmental perturbations that need to be compensated. The larger the variety of available counteractions, the larger the set of disturbances that can be corrected, and the larger the domain of potential environmental situations in which the control system can survive. All other things being equal, greater control variety implies greater fitness... Evolution through natural selection will tend to increase control, and thus, because of Ashby’s law, internal variety. This can be interpreted as a functional differentiation, i.e. the appearance of more diverse activities or functions.
>
> However, the larger the variety of available options, the more difficult it will become for the control system to select the most adequate one, and the longer it will take to decide which action to take. The resulting difficulty of decision- making becomes especially poignant if we take into account the fact that the solution of most problems (i.e. deviations from the desired situation) requires a series of actions... Sequencing of elementary actions produces a combinatorial explosion in the number of possibilities to be considered... The most general way of coping with the complexity of decision-making consists in factorizing the decision problem, i.e. decomposing it into relatively independent subproblems, each characterized by its own subgoal. Each subproblem can be solved by a much smaller combination selected from a reduced set of actions... The linkage between different subproblems is controlled at a higher level, where the goal of “hunting prey” activates a coordinated interplay of subgoals. This may again be controlled at a yet higher level, where the general problem of “reducing hunger” requires a balanced selection or division of labor between activities such as “hunting prey”, “gathering fruit”, and “digging up roots”.
>
> Thus, different lower level activities are linked and integrated in the pursuit of higher order goals, which are themselves integrated at a yet higher level. This results in a functional hierarchy of control levels, which is in many way similar to, though not directly determined by, the structural hierarchy we discussed earlier. A detailed model of fundamental control hierarchies characterizing living systems can be found in Powers’ (1973, 1989) Perceptual Control Theory. The larger the variety of the environmental perturbations that need to be compensated, in general the larger the control hierarchy needed (cf. Aulin's (1979, 1982) law of requisite hierarchy). The emergence of a higher level of control, which may be called a metasystem transition (Turchin, 1977; Heylighen, Joslyn and Turchin, 1995), is a process different from, but to some degree analogous to, the emergence of a supersystem. Thus, the postulated evolutionary increase in control variety will necessarily be accompanied by a sequence of metasystem transitions (Heylighen, 1995).
>
> The higher level processes in a control hierarchy will necessarily extend over longer time intervals, since they require the preliminary completion of lower level subprocesses. For example, the process of hunting prey will take place at a much slower pace than the subprocess of moving a leg in order to sustain running. The higher the level at which a goal is situated, the longer term the planning involved. For example, human activities may be planned for years ahead, whereas the most complex activities of bacteria are likely to be completed in seconds. Thus, the functional hierarchy produces differentiation and integration in the temporal scale dimension, similar to the differentiation and integration in the spatial scale dimension characterizing the structural hierarchy." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "As internal variety increases, decision-making becomes more difficult (even if we assume that decision-making difficulty can be strongly reduced by hierarchical factorization), and so it becomes less and less advantageous to further increase functional variety. The evolving system will asymptotically reach a trade-off level, depending on the variety of perturbations in its environment, where requisite variety is in balance with difficulty of decision-making and perhaps other limiting factors on complexity. For example, for viruses the balance point will be characterised by a very low functional variety, for human beings by a very high one.
>
> This analysis assumes that the environment is stable and a priori given. However, the environment of a system A itself consists of evolving systems (say B, C, D...), which are in general undergoing the same asymptotic increase of variety towards their trade-off points. Since B is in the environment of A, and A in the environment of B, the increase in variety in the one will create a higher need (trade-off point) in variety for the other, since it will now need to control a more complex environment. Thus, instead of an increase in complexity characterised by an asymptotic slowing down, we get a positive feedback process, where the increase in variety in one system creates a stronger need for variety increase in the other (cf. Waddington, 1969). This self-reinforcing interaction is an illustration of the “Red Queen Principle” (Van Valen, 1973), which says that a system must continuously develop in order to merely maintain its fitness relative to the systems it co-evolves with. The net result is that many evolutionary systems that are in direct interaction with each other will tend to grow more complex, and this with an increasing speed...
>
> The present argument does not imply that all evolutionary systems will increase in complexity: those (like viruses, snails or mosses) that have reached a good trade-off point and are not confronted by an environment putting more complex demands on them will maintain their present level of complexity. But it suffices that some systems in the larger ecosystem are involved in the complexity race to see an overall increase of available complexity." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "For evolution it is in general much easier to add a component, which is not likely to do much harm, than to take away a component, which is likely to disturb a complex network of interdependencies. This seems to be confirmed by the observation of vestigial organs, like the appendix, which are conserved by evolution even though they are no longer needed. Thus, even though a radically simplified design with much less components may exist, it is unlikely that this configuration can evolve by taking away components one by one...
>
> This also fits in with our general view of structural complexification, where selection first builds up the smaller and fitter subsystems (which are unlikely to disappear in a later stage) as a foundation and then merely experiments with adding less strongly bound systems here or there. When considered from this angle, the selective force of simplicity is likely to only play a part in minimizing the increase of complexity: from different, otherwise equivalent ways to increase fitness, which by the above reasoning all tend to add complexity, the one will be preferred which adds the least. In that sense, simplicity basically functions to “streamline” designs, not to radically alter them." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "All other things being equal, a system that can survive situations A, B and C, is absolutely fitter than a system that can only survive A and B. Such an increase in absolute fitness is necessarily accompanied by an increase in functional complexity. Thus, evolution will tend to irreversibly produce increases of functional complexity.
>
> This preferred direction must not be mistaken for a preordained course that evolution has to follow. Though systems can be absolutely ordered by their functional complexity, the resulting relation is not a linear order but a partial order: in general, it is not possible to determine which of two arbitrarily chosen systems is most functionally complex. For example, there is no absolute way in which one can decide whether a system that can survive situations A, B and C is more or less complex or fit than a system that can survive C, D and E. Yet, one can state that both systems are absolutely less fit than a system that can survive all A, B, C, D and E. Mathematically, such a partial order can be defined by the inclusion relation operating on the set of all sets of situations or perturbations that the system can survive. This also implies that there are many, mutually incomparable ways in which a system can increase its absolute fitness. For example, the first mentioned system might add either D or E to the set of situations it can cope with. The number of possibilities is infinite. This leaves evolution wholly unpredictable and open-ended." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "The fundamental mechanisms of evolution are variation, which produces spatial differentiation of systems, and selection on the basis of (relative) fitness, which produces structural integration by creating more and stronger linkages between different systems. Together they produce the growth of structural complexity, characterized by the development of nested hierarchies of subsystems and supersystems. This complexification process tends to be self-reinforcing, because the filling of a niche by an additional system (i.e. the creation of a link) creates further niches (i.e. opportunities for additional linkages).
>
> Complexification in the temporal dimension corresponds to an increase in the variety and linkage of a system’s activities or functions. Selection for functional differentiation is entailed by the law of requisite variety, according to which a larger repertoire of possible actions allows the system to survive in a larger variety of situations, and therefore to be absolutely fitter. The need to minimize the difficulty of decision-making and co-ordination between an increasing number of activities leads to the integration of groups of related activities into higher-order functions. The resulting functional complexification produces control hierarchies consisting of object systems and metasystems. This process too is self- reinforcing, since it engenders a complexity arms race between co-evolving systems.
>
> The two mechanisms of structural and functional complexification are moreover likely to reinforce each other: a structurally more complex environment requires a more complex set of functions to cope with it. Similarly, functional complexification seems to require a richer set of structural components and connections to implement it, although this latter issue has not been discussed in this paper...
>
> The proposed mechanisms are not intended to show that evolution follows a preordained course towards some kind of Omega Point of maximal complexity. Rather, it is assumed that evolution is largely unpredictable and contingent on a host of uncontrollable factors, which may steer its course in any of an infinite number of directions. However, it is noted that directions in which complexity increases are generally preferred. This follows from the more fundamental result that evolutionary transitions are asymmetric with respect to time (cf. Heylighen, 1992), since they tend to monotonously increase fitness. Though fitness is relative to the environment, it has two components that can increase in an absolute sense, internal fitness (strength of linkages between components) and number of environmental perturbations that can be counteracted. Increases in these two components tend to be accompanied by respective increases in structural and functional complexity, although selection for simplicity is likely to minimize complexification.
>
> Still, it can happen that systems evolve towards a simpler organization, although this seems rare. It is most likely to occur when the system enters a simpler environment, as when an organism becomes an internal parasite or moves back from the land to the water, but these are obviously unusual examples which go against the general trend of environments becoming more complex." - [The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228607447_The_growth_of_structural_and_functional_complexity_during_evolution)

> "Marketplaces have been known to man for several thousand years. Their historically consistent overall form, a collection of kiosks with goods being offered, and many independent clients buying there, is due to the fundamental asymmetry at the basis of all trade: the asymmetry between its two poles, between supply and demand. Although, conceptually, supply and demand can be said to be of the same kind, namely intentions of taking part in a resource transfer, they differ substantially. Supply appears as the thing being offered, it is thus concrete, can be searched and found, measured and compared. Individual demand, in contrast, denotes the absence of something, thus it does not appear as a physical thing in a traditional marketplace. The same asymmetry pertains to supply and demand on the Web: supply is mostly explicit, has its own representation, such as a product landing page, whereas demand is rarely published as an individual resource. The work at hand aims for reducing this asymmetry. The first step in this direction is to represent both, supply and demand, explicitly as distinct objects on the Web, and to provide a standardized way for them to communicate. Given these prerequisites, the problem of finding a suitable partner for a resource transfer is equivalent to finding a suitable combination of one supply and one demand object. The search for such combinations can be performed manually or automatically by participants from the demand side as well as from the supply side. Moreover, independent entities can assume the role of a matchmaker and inform the participants involved. In order to allow for independent matchmaking, a standardized way of informing supply and demand objects of a possibly interesting combination is required. This set of functions (publishing the intention, performing search or matchmaking, and establishing a communication channel) provides a symmetric base for resource transfer on the Web. This set is minimal and necessary, as no function could be removed without losing the overall functionality." - [A Linked Data Based Messaging Architecture for the Web of Needs](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_266970.pdf)


> "The emergence of a new scientific domain is a good example of the self-organization of such a community of knowledge, where people from initially diverse backgrounds find each other around a common interest, which gradually coalesces into a new paradigm. This process could be observed by mapping the network of authors, publications and keywords in a particular domain at regular intervals (e.g. every 2-5 years), and analyzing it in terms of clustering, hubs, average distances, etc. The change of these features over time may show processes of self-organization taking place. A good theory of the self-organization of knowledge communities would propose a number of processes and parameters that allow us to predict where, when and how such self- organization is most likely to take place. Such a theory would help us to find not only the presently most authoritative concepts, publications or authors (hubs), but those that are likely to become so in the future.

This state tends to increase the utility or fitness of the system’s active components or agents, by coordinating their interactions so as maximize synergy. The resulting organization is distributed over all the agents and their interactions, and thus much more robust and flexible than any centralized design. Moreover, it determines a number of emergent, global properties that cannot be reduced to the properties of the individual components. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, we may be able to facilitate and stimulate such self-organization, or to drive it in one direction rather than another." - [Complexity and Self-organization, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ELIS-complexity.pdf)

> "Even if a number of such components manage to find a mutually beneficial, fitting configuration, there will always remain a “temptation” to defect from the arrangement, i.e. to increase one’s share at the detriment of the others. This is the problem of free riders: in any cooperative, variation of individual components will sooner or later create a variant that selfishly exploits the synergy generated by the others, meaning that it reaps benefits without investing any resources in return... The fundamental problem is that this asymmetry of benefits allows the free rider to multiply faster than the others, so that its progeny eventually dominates the system— thus destroying the cooperative arrangement. The only way the cooperative can protect itself from extinction is by suppressing or controlling any moves towards defection. In both biological and social systems we find plenty of examples of such controls: e.g. the immune system, the police, and the judiciary. The fundamental issue in the modelling of evolutionary transitions then is how such sophisticated, adaptive control systems can evolve out of simple interactions." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "The reverse side of this principle is that synergy is more difficult to achieve when resource utilization is more similar. Greater similarity in utilization not only means less complementarity, but more competition for the resources that both parties need, and therefore more conflict. Mutualism is therefore easier to evolve for individuals of very different types (such as algae and fungi) than for individuals of the same species.

> Since natural selection prefers a synergetic relation to a conflictual one, evolution will push systems to differentiate their use of resources over time. Competition between related species within the same environment (e.g. Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos islands) will create a selective pressure for them to specialize in exploiting different niches, so as to have a minimal overlap in the resources they consume. The same dynamics can be found in the economy, where market forces push companies to differentiate their products from the ones of their competitors, so as to attract different clients.
>
> Such ecological or economic differentiation can produce synergy as a side effect, since a variety of ways of processing resources (e.g. photosynthesis) will produce a variety of “by-products” (e.g. oxygen) which may become resources for a newly differentiated type of system (e.g. animals). However, the relations between any two components of such an ecosystem or market tend to be weak and opportunistic, with relatively little reciprocity or mutual dependence. There is no closure to tie the collective together, and without a control mechanism it is easy for outsiders or free riders to invade and exploit the system. Therefore, we will in general not view the evolution of an ecosystem or unregulated economy as a transition to a higher level individual. Typical higher level systems, such as multicellular organisms and societies, are formed through a different mechanism, which starts out with similar rather than differentiated components. To explain this, we need to examine the evolution of asymmetric relations." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "The selective pressure against conflict has a different effect on asymmetric relations. Asymmetry already implies a differentiation of niches or roles, separating the exploiter from the exploited. While the exploiter has the power to extract resources from the exploited without offering anything in return, such interaction is precarious in the long run. Success for the exploiter, in the sense of a growing harvest of resources, weakens the exploited, thus endangering the exploiter’s future supply. Predators that are too successful may kill off their prey populations, and thus starve themselves to death. Parasites that weaken their host so much that it dies usually also get killed in the process. Even if no host actually dies, parasite variants whose hosts do better will win the competition from variants that weaken their hosts more. Therefore, evolutionists have long posited that parasites tend to lose their virulence, become more benign, and eventually evolve to mutualists, who fully compensate for the losses they inflict so as to keep their hosts thriving...
>
> Thus, the general evolutionary tendency is for exploiters to become cultivators, i.e. to maintain their control over the systems whose resources they reap, but to become increasingly benign, thus ensuring that their “flock” thrives. For example, prehistoric humans, after killing off most of the large prey animals (“megafauna”), were forced to become herders, caring to maintain the health of their cattle. Warlords who came to dominate and exploit a group of farmers through sheer force first became feudal lords protecting their villagers against bandits, then more or less enlightened rulers, and eventually presidents, democratically elected for their assumed prowess in making the country prosper." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "The emergence of cultivation can explain some of the most fundamental evolutionary transitions... The evolution of cultivators suggests a general solution to the free rider problem: the selective pressure to maximize the productivity of its “flock” without weakening it will turn the cultivator into a “manager”, in the terminology of Stewart, who controls conflicts and suppresses free riders that would otherwise sap the collective...
>
> But Stewart extends this scenario even to “managers” that are non-material, such as religions, customs and institutions. Such social-informational systems can be seen as complexes of memes, i.e. ideas, traditions, rules, etc. that are transmitted from person to person, acting as the cultural equivalent of genes. Just like genes, memes can be selfish or parasitic, using their hosts merely for their own proliferation, without caring for the hosts’ well-being. Examples of such parasitic memes are certain religious cults, such as Heaven’s Gate or Aum Shinrikyo, that exploit or even kill off their followers. However, according to the rules of parasite ecology, vertically transmitted (i.e. from parent to offspring) parasites must lose their virulence, as their hosts must remain fit enough to produce sufficient offspring. Therefore, as Cullen argues, the major world religions have evolved to a generally benign state. This means that they support the well-being of their flock, promoting cooperation and curbing internal conflict and profiteering through the imposition of well-honed moral rules." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "We see that the parasite to cultivator/manager scenario, as proposed by Stewart, can explain a wide range of evolutionary transitions. However, it still provides little detail about how a new control structure precisely evolves, especially when the conceived “parasite” becomes increasingly abstract. To arrive at deeper understanding, we need to make one further generalization, turning the cultivator from an outside agent invading the collective into an internal, distributed mode of interaction that we will call “aspect”." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

!!! ^^ The only "criticism" I've found of Stewart's Management Theory

> "Once money had evolved, a new property could emerge to support a reference signal: the price, i.e. the monetary value—or equivalent in money units—of any given resource. In the present market mechanism the price functions as an error signal, representing the deviation between the ideally desired availability of resources (collective demand) and the actual availability (collective supply). The price is zero only if there is no scarcity, i.e. if the supply is always larger than or equal to the full demand. The larger the price (error), the higher the motivation for agents to possess and sell that kind of good, and therefore the more effort they will invest into increasing the supply, thus reducing the deviation between supply and demand. The price mechanism turns the market into a negative feedback loop with amplification (because a small change in price can lead to a large change in production effort) and a reference signal or goal (optimal satisfaction of the demand).
>
> Thus, the “invisible hand” of the market is actually a distributed control system or manager emerging from the mediator that is money and the medium that is the market-place. This manager coordinates, regulates and initiates interactions between the agents of the collective so as to—theoretically—maximize their synergy.
>
> Note that in practice markets are far from the optimizing systems envisioned by neo-classical economists, which is why additional regulators such as institutions, taxes and subsidies had (and still have) to evolve. This is due in part to the fact that as yet the “demand” signal does not reliably represent the true needs of the collective, as it is subject to vicious cycles such as the poverty trap, technological lock-in, and the booms and busts caused by speculation, and to the continuing threat of free riders, which must be held in check by mutual monitoring and legal control." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "Perhaps a last step in the development of the manager is the evolution of distributed cognition. Control entails knowledge, since the control system must know which action to perform in order to correct which deviation. When deviations can be represented by a one-dimensional variable, such as temperature or price, this may appear trivial. The only “knowledge” needed in this case is the direction in which to compensate—e.g. heat when it is too cold, cool when it is too hot. The control loop ensures that this will drive and maintain the system near its reference point. In more complex, multidimensional state spaces, however, choosing the correct sequence of actions to achieve the goal is everything but trivial, and the control system must incorporate a model of the problem environment in order to achieve any success rate better than chance.
>
> This model will be implicit in the pattern of interactions defining the mediator/manager. For example, an efficient market implicitly “knows” which combination of goods and services to produce in order to satisfy present and anticipated demand, and uses a variety of interaction channels between investors, suppliers, producers, sellers and buyers to propagate the right information to the right agent. The manager may also use an external support to store and disseminate its knowledge among the agents. For example, the pheromone network produced by ants can be seen as a distributed model or mental map of their foraging environment, which is available for consultation by any agent." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

> "While at the higher level there is a selective pressure for finding synergetic configurations that minimize conflict, at the lower level there always remains a “temptation” to defect from such an arrangement, leading to the creation of free-riders that eventually undermine the synergy. The precariousness of such symmetric forms of synergy (cooperation) can be counterbalanced by the evolution of asymmetric relations. In this situation, the selective pressure for synergy makes exploiters evolve into cultivators. The control exerted by the cultivator over the cultivated gives the latter the power and the “motivation” to suppress conflict in the former." - [Mediator Evolution: a general scenario for the origin of dynamical hierarchies, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MediatorEvolution.pdf)

So, although we may wish to limit our intake of information, ephemeralization forces us to pay attention to ever more data. The problem is that people have clear limits in the amount of information they can process. To use Simon’s well-known phrase, they have bounded rationality.

At the most basic level, “economy” means simply the careful management of resources, so that as little as possible is wasted.

> "Such a global brain would solve the problem of information overload at the most fundamental level. For the individual it would provide constant decision-support, presenting recommended choices in their apparent order of importance, as determined by the individual’s own preferences, the experience of all other agents, and the collective preferences of society. Complemented by an in-depth teaching and implementation of the rules of information hygiene, such a system should be able to eliminate the stress of of not being able to cope with the number of available options, while minimizing the risk of bad decisions because of insufficient information being taken into account.
>
> Depending on the amount of attention or effort the individual is willing to invest in the decision, (s)he could either immediately accept the “default” recommendation, or examine a variable number of options in more depth, making a choice that is potentially very different from the one initially recommended by the system... The degree to which individuals actively participate in the decision-making will moreover depend on their own level of education and intelligence. The smarter and the more experienced in the domain you are, the higher your chances to find a solution that is better than the default one, and the more the system can learn from your contribution. Thus, individual advances in knowledge and intelligence will directly or indirectly benefit the capacities of the collective.
>
> On the level of society, a global brain-like system should be able to tackle the problems associated with the complexity and sensitivity of causal networks. It should be able to take into account myriad events and their interactions, and intervene immediately, before any problem can snowball out of control. Of course, even an intelligence of this supra-human order of magnitude will never be able to reliably predict the future behavior of a system that is in essence chaotic. Yet, as cybernetics has taught us, detailed prediction (feedforward) is not necessary as long as the regulatory system can react quickly and adequately to any potentially dangerous perturbation (feedback). Moreover, by modelling the effects of complex interactions such a system should be able to solve the productivity paradox, overcoming the socio- institutional inertia, the non-linear side-effects and bottlenecks that hold back productivity growth." - [Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-overload.pdf)

This collective register of activities is often called a shared “blackboard”, “white board” or “workspace”. However, a record of all communications does not yet constitute a mental map.

This will only leave what the different routes have in common, namely their bias towards the optimal solution. It seems that a similar mechanism may apply to human decision-making, under the same condition that there is no systematic bias away from the optimum. Therefore, we may expect the average of the choices made by a large group to be effectively better than the choice made by a random individual... As could be expected from the law of large numbers, the averaging mechanism provides decreasing returns: the improvement produced by adding a fixed number of individuals to the collective will become smaller as the size of the collective increases." - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

This risk can be controlled by adjusting the individuals’ sensitivity to the collective preference...

Instead of asking opinions to each individual, you might try to determine an “average opinion” for the group, like in the voting and collective maze exploration exam- ples we discussed before. This, however, ignores your particular interests, which may be different from those of the “average person”. You would rather like to hear the opinions of those people who have interests similar to your own, that is to say, you would prefer a “division-of-labor” type of organization, where people only contribute to the domain they are specialized in.

Thus the properties of the systems themselves must be distinguished from those of their models, which depend on us as their creators... A second-order cyberneticist working with an organism or social system, on the 3other hand, recognizes that system as an agent in its own right, interacting with another agent, the observer. As quantum mechanics has taught us, observer and observed cannot be separated, and the result of observations will depend on their interaction. The observer too is a cybernetic system, trying to construct a model of another cybernetic system. To understand this process, we need a "cybernetics of cybernetics", i.e. a "meta" or "second-order" cybernetics." - [Cybernetics and Second-Order Cybernetics, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Cybernetics-EPST.pdf)

It leads to the somewhat counterintuitive observation that the regulator must have a sufficiently large variety of actions in order to ensure a sufficiently small variety of outcomes in the essential variables E. This principle has important implications for practical situations: since the variety of perturbations a system can potentially be confronted with is unlimited, we should always try maximize its internal variety (or diversity), so as to be optimally prepared for any foreseeable or unforeseeable contigency." - [Cybernetics and Second-Order Cybernetics, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Cybernetics-EPST.pdf)

> "A control loop will reduce the variety of perturbations, but it will in general not be able to eliminate all variation. Adding a control loop on top of the original loop may eliminate the residual variety, but if that is not sufficient, another hierarchical level may be needed. The required number of levels therefore depends on the regulatory ability of the individual control loops: the weaker that ability, the more hierarchy is needed. This is Aulin's law of requisite hierarchy. On the other hand, increasing the number of levels has a negative effect on the overall regulatory ability, since the more levels the perception and action signals have to pass through, the more they are likely to suffer from noise, corruption, or delays. Therefore, if possible, it is best to maximize the regulatory ability of a single layer, and thus minimize the number of requisite layers. This principle has important applications for social organizations, which have a tendency to multiply the number of bureaucratic levels. The present trend towards the flattening of hierarchies can be explained by the increasing regulatory abilities of individuals and organizations, due to better education, management and technological support.

Higher organisms have developed a more efficient way to construct models: learning. In learning, different rules compete with each other within the same organism's control structure. Depending on their success in predicting or controlling disturbances, rules are differentially rewarded or reinforced. The ones that receive most reinforcement eventually come to dominate the less successful ones. This can be seen as an application of control at the metalevel, or a metasystem transition, where now the goal is to minimize the perceived difference between prediction and observation, and the actions consist in varying the components of the model." - [Cybernetics and Second-Order Cybernetics, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Cybernetics-EPST.pdf)

This is how we implicitly learn our knowledge.
>
> A core tenet of the anticipation-control theory, as emphasized by Hawkins, is that the brain is organized hierarchically, in different levels of invariance or control, whereby a higher level only becomes active when the lower levels fail to make a good prediction. It is this hierarchical structure with massive feedback from the higher to the lower levels, allowing us to recognize and learn ever more complex invariances and covariances of patterns, that distinguishes the anticipation-control model from traditional neural network models." - [Towards an anticipation control theory of mind, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AnticipationControl.pdf)

> "The very limited sensory input that an organism has leaves a great amount of uncertainty about the actual state of a complex and changeful world, and about the appropriate actions to take in that situation. Any mechanism of anticipation or expectation that a priori reduces uncertainty will therefore have a large positive impact on the organism's capability for control, and thus on its fitness. The essence of cognition is precisely to produce such a mechanism that can complement or fill in incomplete data. To achieve optimal control, anticipation and perception, or feedforward and feedback, must go hand in hand, the one constantly correcting and extending the other." - [Towards an anticipation control theory of mind, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AnticipationControl.pdf)

> "Humans are among the most cooperative and social species on the planet. As Harvard evolutionary biologist Martin Nowak puts it, we are “super cooperators.” Throughout our history, individual survival was often tied to group survival, so our species evolved strong instincts to initiate and sustain cooperation. Those instincts have a positive side, what researchers call “prosocial behaviors,” such as generosity, reciprocity and the desire to build trust in relationships. But they also have a dark side. When people feel they have been cooperative and contributed, but others have not played their part and have instead been free riders who lie, cheat and take advantage of the nice cooperators, then they react with a sense of moral outrage and a desire to punish those who have violated cooperative norms.
>
> In fact, experiments show that people are willing to dish out punishments that are more costly to themselves than any possible benefit. We see this not just in the lab but in the real world. Consider acrimonious lawsuits or divorce cases where the aggrieved parties sue each other into financial oblivion. While standard economic theory might say such behavior is “irrational,” it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. When people go a bit crazy and dish out punishments that are costly for themselves, they are in effect taking one for the team and helping enforce norms of cooperation for the group as a whole. Researchers call this “altruistic punishment,” and it means that potential cheaters and free riders pay a higher cost for their bad behavior than if every individual was strictly “rational.” Further experiments show that without altruistic punishment, free-riding and cheating go up, and it is very hard for groups to establish and sustain cooperation.
>
> Another common reaction when people feel fairness is violated is to team up with other people who feel cheated as well. If cooperation is broadly breaking down, it makes sense to seek out people like yourself, who you can trust, and fight back together against the perceived violators. In history, the notion of “people like me” has often meant people who share some common identity (e.g., ethnic, religious, regional, cultural). So, when larger-scale societal cooperation breaks down, identity-based tribalism often goes up." - [Trust, Populism and the Psychology of Broken Contracts, by Eric Beinhocker](https://www.edelman.com/trust/edelman-trust-institute/Publication/2023/trust-populism-and-broken-contracts#:~:text=Humans%20are%20among,often%20goes%20up.)

Computer scientist Viktoras Veitas and philosopher David Weinbaum recently proposed a futuristic evolutionary paradigm, the ‘World of Views’, which may be useful to help us situate an exploration of the technocultural world. The ‘World of Views’ attempts to understand a post- scarcity, post-singularity, evolutionary landscape where the primary driver of change is the “multiplicity of unique, modular, and open co-evolving worldviews” (Veitas & Weinbaum 2015, p. 504)

we can use the dynamics of a system on one level to predict/model the dynamics of the system on another level - all complex adaptive systems have some similar patterns
isomorphic relationship between different levels of emergence/complexity?
the principle of consequence capture is one such example that can be found on all levels
