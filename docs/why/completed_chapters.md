Memes all the way down - what is the root meme? We need to surface truth to the best of our abilities and crowd-source morality. We shake hands when we meet - that's culture. How do we fix the rest of culture?
God in 3 sentences:
God is the link (our connectedness) with everyone else. God is what we have in common and our purpose in life is to discover him. Spirituality is a spectrum and a gradient - a journey, a path towards him - towards connectedness with everyone else.
We need to learn to enjoy the ride and succumb to it.
We need to create an aggregate connectome - what we share
The final religion is participation in the creation of God

Participatory culture is the religion of the 21st century - religion starts with a practice
Religions are participatory
We’ve never been able to do participatory culture and be tribal at scale until now

Human life is the most precious thing - but we sure as hell aint structured like we value it all that much. How do we make everyone contributors? Transparency and openness lead to integration and fusion of minds.

How do we make sure we don't kill curiosity in kids? Make curiosity pay dividends - harness intelligence
We have generations of gamers - because there’s no alternative. We need to make God their playground and we would be the stewarts of it - generational transmission.

God is compassion
God is transparent. God is light. God is the sun

As long as there’s an argument to have a CIA we’ve not reached sustainability.

God is a mechanism and a direction. God is alignment. God is consequence capture. God is integrated information. God is connectedness. God is consciousness.

> "I suspect that we can reconstruct the concept of God as an entirely rational concept, as a global optimum of transcendent (emergent collective) agency, affording a space of justifiable vantage points that allow judging between the available event trajectories." - [Joscha Bach](https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1729067903457366325)

God allows us to ask the question “What is my purpose” and then get an option along with a path for how to get there. You can get multiple options that are personalized to you

God is the search engine of meaning in life

The god of the 21st century is the most just of all

God is the planetary nervous system of humanity

(Sovereign) identity is the key to god

God is the fairness protocol

God is the purest form of cooperation - the most efficient one - achievable only with maximal alignment which requires trust through  transparency and reputation.

People want to be loved.

And we love the most the incorruptible - those who have a track record of ethics

God is leaving the world better after yourself

We need something that would sell itself

God is a story and we can choose him

God is an attractor - an aspiration. God is always further - there’s always more to improve. God delivers protopia - by terhering our values as the source of everything for meaning

God is the answer to meaning - god is what we create. God is what we contribute to - that’s god. The evolution of culture - the human spirit

The God inversion
God's inversion
The problem of the creator of God is solved once we decide to be his creators instead of being created by him
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_creator_of_God

Your choices of the rules you follow decide the fate of humanity - there’s a responsibility

We choose to create God not because it is easy but because it is necessary - JFK, probably

Enlightenment 1.0 killed god and the 2.0 version needs to reinvent him
Quote god is waiting at the bottom of the glass

God is the protocol ecosystem of cooperation and shared intentionality.
Creating god would ensure we hatch from Earth as an egg and secure the existence of life for as long as possible

> "God is a concept far too important to leave to the religious." - [Quentin Meillassoux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntheism#:~:text=God%20is%20a%20concept%20far%20too%20important%20to%20leave%20to%20the%20religious)

What if God is not the creator but something we create and merge with? We should put God in the future - we should create him.

> "To me, the name “God” is an amazing name for all the dreams of humanity projected into one point. What would you name that? You would name it God. And that is what we need to do, to retake the “God” word but just give God proper qualities that we can actually believe in." - [Alexander Bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntheism#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20the%20name%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20is%20an%20amazing%20name%20for%20all%20the%20dreams%20of%20humanity%20projected%20into%20one%20point.%20What%20would%20you%20name%20that%3F%20You%20would%20name%20it%20God.%20And%20that%20is%20what%20we%20need%20to%20do%2C%20to%20retake%20the%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20word%20but%20just%20give%20God%20proper%20qualities%20that%20we%20can%20actually%20believe%20in.)


> "The Latin verb religare means to 're-bind'. The Latin noun religio referring to obligation, bond, or reverence is probably based on religare, so religio and its English derivation religion connote a 're-binding'." - [Peter Lucas Hulen on Religion](http://persweb.wabash.edu/facstaff/hulenp/religion.html#:~:text=The%20Latin%20verb%20religare%20means,a%20're%2Dbinding'.)



> "Syntheism is essentially idea that God is a good word to use, because God is the ultimate. And we have no better word for the ultimate. So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

> "I think the problem with the West that we're living with today is that exploitative behavior of the West across the world that caused the current problems was because state and market were left outside of religion." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=2799)
^^ Not sure about this...

> "We can plunder all the religious and philosophical history and check out what were the ideas that really survived what were ideas that were timeless and that turns out to be the ideas that concerned humans and what were the ideas that were time specific oh they turned out to be the the concern technology that concerned equality is like learning and reading and speaking and writing or whatever we humans do or artistic expression okay that's what changes over time now if we know that if you see that pattern we can then construct a value system that works for us today and because it concerns a new paradigm as nietzsche would say and we have a freedom then to be creative about this we call that process paradigmatics so what we're creating today is a system of values that work for us and that development is with metamodernism for example today's interest it is interested in what kind of values do we co-create here so we get the really creative discussion and conversation but also that the little genius among us that need their own space to work in the little monasteries to construct whatever they can construct can also do that and so we can also embrace that engineers and traders are creating enormous value and they need our support they might even need some kind of religious direction." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=4657)
