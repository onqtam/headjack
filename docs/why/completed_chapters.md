> "To me, the name “God” is an amazing name for all the dreams of humanity projected into one point. What would you name that? You would name it God. And that is what we need to do, to retake the “God” word but just give God proper qualities that we can actually believe in." - [Alexander Bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntheism#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20the%20name%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20is%20an%20amazing%20name%20for%20all%20the%20dreams%20of%20humanity%20projected%20into%20one%20point.%20What%20would%20you%20name%20that%3F%20You%20would%20name%20it%20God.%20And%20that%20is%20what%20we%20need%20to%20do%2C%20to%20retake%20the%20%E2%80%9CGod%E2%80%9D%20word%20but%20just%20give%20God%20proper%20qualities%20that%20we%20can%20actually%20believe%20in.)


> "The Latin verb religare means to 're-bind'. The Latin noun religio referring to obligation, bond, or reverence is probably based on religare, so religio and its English derivation religion connote a 're-binding'." - [Peter Lucas Hulen on Religion](http://persweb.wabash.edu/facstaff/hulenp/religion.html#:~:text=The%20Latin%20verb%20religare%20means,a%20're%2Dbinding'.)



> "Syntheism is essentially idea that God is a good word to use, because God is the ultimate. And we have no better word for the ultimate. So say if you and I would set sit down together and discuss dreams - what we dream about the most and what could possibly sometimes in the future - whether in our lifetime or not - if something could happen that would really really strike us as a worthy goal to work towards - that will give us purpose and meaning with everything we do in our lives - now, now there's no better word for that if that's a shared point - there's no better word for that than God." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1797)

> "Now what if we start imagine that the world could be different from what it is - it could just be different - it doesn't have necessarily to be better, but at least to some people it would be preferable and more interesting simply because it's more novel. Okay, that's an exodus, and an exodus doesn't have to be geographical - an exodus can also be paradigmatic, an exodus could be from one time to another time. So say we want to take the Internet and its full potential seriously - we don't want to do like people do so far, which is basically they throw themselves into the Internet age, but they take all the values with them from the previous capitalist stage and therefore they don't get it. So they do all the things wrong with essentially the mess we're in right now in 2021. What if we just start looking at the technology itself and its full potential and its full potential for us as human beings and then some of us really devote ourselves and say that we're gonna do the Internet properly and we're gonna maximize the man-machine relationship in the Internet age? Now you don't have any other name for that than God. And this is the beauty of it, because we've obviously torn down God - throwing him out with atheism and everything... declared God is dead - well essentially outside the christians are saying - well that's a good word to use then, because if God is now thrown out and declared over and he's not in any longer, but rather he's out and the fashion dictates that we should all be proud atheists by now - then we're just saying that well that's kind of a bad idea - you can keep God, you just take God from the past and say he never existed - it doesn't mean he cannot exist - we just put him into the future. This is the idea of Syntheism - the idea is that the God we always claimed was in the past wasn't there - we've gotten used to that idea, we've even gotten used in a Nietzschen fashion to the freedom that comes with the idea that God was never there. Now what if we use that freedom to instead create the God that we prefer? Because it turns out the way technology is developing at the moment - without a certain consciousness of that process - we will probably develop a God that will destroy us. It will probably be preferable if this God that we're creating - Syntheos - if the Syntheos was actually co-created by the smartest and wisest human beings who put both their creativity and their wisdom into that process. And this is when it gets really interesting, because when we get the certain awareness of this, which we call Syntheology - the idea that we actually start to design God before God occurs - until God has arrived we have the possible designing him, so we're now doing our 40-year journey through the desert, we've left the capitalist aged, we walked into the attentionalist informationalist age, we've done so you and I have certainly done so fully and embraced it, we're now on our journey and while we're on the journey we can actually design God by designing the very temple - the container - within which we will put God when he arrives." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=1931)

> "I think the problem with the West that we're living with today is that exploitative behavior of the West across the world that caused the current problems was because state and market were left outside of religion." - [Alexander Bard](https://youtu.be/BmV9tdYyUUE?t=2799)
