# Collective Intelligence

<!-- > "Collective intelligence: Collective intelligence is the degree to which the agents in a system together make better decisions or solve more complex problems than any of them individually. For example, individual ants have very limited intelligence, but the ant colony as a whole can make surprisingly good decisions, such as developing a map with paths of pheromone indicating the shortest routes to various sources of food." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary) -->

> "Collective intelligence: the degree to which the agents in a system collectively can make good decisions as to their future course of action; in particular, the degree to which the agents collectively can make better decisions than any of them individually. Collective intelligence typically arises from the pooling of knowledge: since each agent’s knowledge is slightly different from the knowledge of the others, all agents together will have access to a larger pool of more diverse knowledge. Therefore, collective intelligence can be amplified by increasing the diversity of knowledge among the agents." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

> "Distributed cognition: the acquisition, storage and use of information and knowledge distributed over different agents in a system, so as to support their collective intelligence. This requires mechanisms to communicate information across the different agents in a coordinated manner, so that the right information is gathered at the right place at the right time. Examples of such supporting mechanisms for the exchange of information are pheromones (smell signals), language, books, signs, computers and the Internet." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)










> "For an intelligence to belong properly to a collective, it must arise not from the cleverness of its members but from having the right kind of functional relationships between them... All individuals are collectives, made of parts that used to be individuals themselves... Multicellular organisms exhibit multi-scale autonomy, a dynamic interplay of competition and cooperation, and coordinated collective action inherent to their development, function and behaviour, while being a society of cells. Thus, individuals like you and I, and collectives like swarms and colonies, are not as categorically different as they first appear... All intelligences are collectives. Individual intelligence, in the familiar guise of a central nervous system or a brain, arises from the interaction of many unintelligent components (neurons) arranged in the right organisation with the right connections. This is the foundation of connectionism; that intelligence resides not in the individual parts but in the arrangement of the connections between them. The individual neuron is not where all the interesting cognition and learning occur. It is the distributed collective activity in the network that constitutes cognition and changes to the organisation of network connections that constitute learning. So brains are collectives, thus collectives of the right kind do cognise and learn. In fact, brains provide the archetypal example of an intelligent collective.
>
> ... Cognition and learning are substrate-independent. The principles of distributed cognition familiar in artificial neural networks can be implemented by any network of signals and non-linear responses to suitably weighted inputs. Gene-regulation networks, ecological networks and social networks can all compute in the same sense as neural networks if the connections are suitably arranged. In development and organismic biology, many different levels of adaptive networks exist aside from neural networks, including gene-regulation networks, protein networks, metabolic networks, morphogen diffusion networks and endocrine systems. In addition, it is clear that morphogenesis, physiological function and the adaptive processes of robustness and repair all require information integration and collective action that constitute cognition – in many cases without neurons. Each of these phenomena exhibits the same learning behaviours, including the storage and retrieval of multiple associative memories, effecting classification and recognition with generalisation capabilities, and learning to solve combinatorial optimisation problems better with experience.
>
> ... The credit assignment problems inherent in collective intelligence are fundamental in all cognition and learning, and in all biological individuality... The credit assignment issues of collective intelligence are not categorically distinct from related core issues in individual adaptation, evolution and intelligence.
>
> ... All intelligences are made out of components that act on local information based on individual feedbacks. In a multicellular organism, for example, the individual cells exhibit agency based on local information and rewards, and the system (cellular swarm) as a whole does also, exhibiting information integration and anatomical decision making at the system-scale.
>
> ... In collectives, each component selects behaviours based on the rewards they receive for their own actions. In intelligent systems, the reward feedback is effectively operating at a higher level – and the system as a whole selects behaviours based on the rewards received by the system as a whole. Accordingly, it makes sense that the system selects behaviours that facilitate long- term collective reward. But operationally, each component within the intelligent system is still autonomous, selecting individual actions based on individual rewards given the relational context they find themselves in. The question is, **what kinds of interaction structures cause collectives to behave like intelligent agents, exhibiting information integration and coordinated action that effect reward feedback at the system level?**
>
> ... While connectionist models of cognition and learning do not have all the answers, they do identify the kind of relationships that turn a collection of unintelligent components into a collective intelligence, with cognitive and learning abilities that belong to the whole and not the parts... We propose that these relationships are cognitive architectures regardless of the substrate in which they are implemented. That is, the causal structures necessary to create fitness that properly belongs to the whole rather than its parts are the same as those required to carry out the integration of information and coordination of action characteristic of a ’self’. We propose that such functionality constitutes cognition in a formal sense, whether the causal structures are implemented by chemical, gene-regulatory, bio-electrical, neural, ecological or social interactions.
>
> ... The curious thing about collective intelligence is that the more intelligent something is, the less it looks like a collective. When component members act in an efficiently coordinated manner, with behaviours that can be diverted from their short-term self-interest to serve long-term collective interest, a collective looks more like an individual at a higher level of organisation. Recognising this, biology is full of collective intelligence – not just in the weak sense of swarms and colonies with emergent behaviours but because any organism is actually an intelligent collective.
>
> ... Although all cells in most multicellular organisms share the same genome, the remarkable protein machinery that genome encodes, along with the cytoskeletal and lipid structures each cell inherits from its ancestors, enables a collective of embryonic cells to develop differentiated roles and self-organise into a large-scale, functional machine. Development thus involves a multi-scale hierarchy of cooperating and competing subunits, each with local computational and goal-directed capacity, that enables the whole to function as a singular subject of memories and preferences – a unified locus of learning and homeostatic loops that harness its subunits towards goal states... Anatomical homeostasis – the ability to adjust anatomy despite injury or drastic rearrangement – requires the collective to have a degree of autonomous problem-solving activity in morphospace, defined as the space of possible anatomical configurations.
>
> ... Hebbian learning in a self-modelling dynamical system effects a positive feedback on correlations; the more things co-occur, the more the connection between them changes to make them more likely to co-occur in future... The application of connectionist models also extends into the domain of evolutionary systems, where the connections of a network are changed by variation and selection, as seen in the evolution of interaction networks in development and ecology. In these ‘evolutionary connectionism’ models, ordinary processes of random variation and selection act on the functional interactions between components, altering their organisation in a way that positively reinforces correlations – functionally equivalent to connectionist learning models.
>
> ... No individual cell has the entire experience of performing an action and reaping its benefits – that relationship only exists in the ‘group mind’ of the collective agent. How do the parts discern which of their actions should be reinforced? **Problems of distributed credit assignment are a key aspect of intelligence**... It is imperative to understand the developmental algorithms and signals by which tissue-level agents incentivise lower-level subunits (e.g. cells and molecular pathways), distorting their option space so that simple, local descent down free-energy paths (short-sighted self-interest) result in higher order adaptive activity (long-term collective interest). The key to being an individual is to have a functional structure in which diverse experiences across its components are bound together in a way that generates causal relationships and composite memories that belong to the higher space of the individual and not its components.
>
> ... It is no accident that the issue of credit assignment, and the application of credit to parts or wholes, is a central one in evolutionary selection, developmental and organismic biology and cognitive science. It is a feature of many difficult learning tasks that they require sequences of actions that are many steps away from ultimate goals – making it intrinsically difficult to incentivise the component parts involved. This is what makes difficult tasks difficult; conversely, having feedbacks that are additive and individual, is what makes easy tasks easy.
>
> ... What kinds of relationships are necessary to turn a society into an individual? A central aspect of how intelligence arises from a collection of subunits is the specific communication and functional linkages between them, as well as the algorithms for updating those interactions in light of experience... For individuals that interact with others in a collective, the ability to act in a manner that is consistent with long-term individual interest is frequently aligned with the ability to act in a manner that is consistent with collective interest (though it may be opposed by individual short-term interest).
>
> ... organismic individuality evolved through a bottom-up process of collective intelligence, resulting in information integration and coordinated action so well-organised that we observe a new level of organismic and evolutionary individuality... Acting in a manner consistent with long-term collective interests, in particular when this conﬂicts with short-term self-interest, is not just a hallmark of collective intelligence but is in fact what constitutes cognition and individuality at the collective level... From subcellular processes, to cellular swarms during morphogenesis, to ecological dynamics on evolutionary timescales – all of these processes are driven by the scaling of reward dynamics that bind subunits into collectives that better navigate novel problem spaces." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)

> "**We are all collective intelligences – we’re all made of parts, and we’re “real” (more than just a pile of parts) to the extent that those parts are aligned in ways that enable the whole to have goals, competencies, and navigational capabilities in problem spaces that the parts do not.** As a simple example, a rat is trained to press a lever and get a reward. But no individual cell has both experiences: interacting with the lever (the cells at the palm of the paws do that) or receiving the delicious pellet (the gut cells do that). So who can own the memory provided by this instrumental learning – who associates the two experiences? The owner is “the rat” – a collective that exists because an important kind of cognitive glue enables the collection of cells to integrate information across distance in space and time, and thus know things the individual cells don’t know. **The ability to integrate the experience and memory of your parts toward a new emergent being is crucial to being a composite intelligent agent. It’s pretty clear that an agent needs to be integrated into a coherent, emergent whole to learn things that none of its individual parts know (or can know).**" - [Michael Levin](https://thoughtforms.life/learning-to-be-how-learning-strengthens-the-emergent-nature-of-collective-intelligence-in-a-minimal-agent/)

## Multiscale Competency Architecture

> "A defining feature of biology is the use of a multiscale architecture, ranging from molecular networks to cells, tissues, organs, whole bodies, and swarms. Crucially however, biology is not only nested structurally, but also functionally: each level is able to solve problems in distinct problem spaces, such as physiological, morphological, and behavioral state space. Percolating adaptive functionality from one level of competent subunits to a higher functional level of organization requires collective dynamics: multiple components must work together to achieve specific outcomes.
>
> ... One defining feature of complex life, making it distinct from our current engineered artifacts, is its multiscale nature: there is order in biology across levels of organization, from molecules to cells, tissues, organs, whole organisms, and societies/swarms. Crucially, however, this goes well beyond structural nesting: it is in fact a multiscale competency architecture, because each level solves problems in its own relevant domains. As evolution facilitated the increase of complexity, living things became composed of layers that cooperate and compete to solve problems in metabolic, physiological, anatomical, and behavioral state spaces. Biology’s robustness, open-endedness, evolvability, and unique complexity likely depend on the fact that evolution works with an agential material – a substrate with competencies, computational abilities, and homeodynamic setpoints, that strongly influence the structure and function of multicellular forms. Adaptive behavior in new problem spaces, can arise because higher levels of organization can deform the energy landscape for the subunits, while benefitting from their ability to navigate those landscapes autonomously and without micromanagement.
>
> ... Living bodies implement a multiscale competency architecture in which each level of organization, from molecular networks to swarms of animals, navigates specific problem spaces, such as metabolic, physiological, transcriptional, anatomical, and behavioral landscapes. As these diverse subsystems cooperate and compete with each other, their problem-solving dynamics constate adaptive collective intelligence. Indeed, one way to view evolution of complex forms is as a re-use of many of the same mechanisms and strategies across scales of organization, and problem spaces, which may even extend to high-level navigation of linguistic space.
>
> ... Collective Intelligence expands the perceptual field of a group of cells beyond the capacity of any individual, expanding their problem solving ability. The competency of subunits that flows upward to the collective decision-making is a kind of intelligence – the ability to navigate an environment in an adaptive way that enables specific homeostatic or homeodynamic goals to be met despite novel perturbations or barriers. Non-living objects are capable of simple goal directed behavior, as in the case of a bar magnet moving towards its counterpart (a). This movement can be blocked by an impediment in the direct path of the magnet. Intelligent systems also exhibit goal directedness with the addition of continually surveying their environment in both time and space to find alternate paths to achieve their goal (b). Biological intelligent systems demonstrate increased ability to achieve their (collective) goals despite obstacles by integrating the individual competencies of their components (which can perform tasks in their own space without any inkling of the large-scale goals to which they contribute) (c). This integration enables collectives to survey larger spatial areas and transmit information about possible solutions from one individual to another and likewise expands the capacity of the individual to incorporate information from the past and anticipated future due to the greater computational capacity and broader spatio-temporal perceptual/actuation horizons.
>
> ... Because of life’s multi-scale competency architecture, a fundamental aspect of intelligence is collective behavior: all intelligences appear to be made of parts, connected by mechanisms implementing policies that bind the competent components into a cooperative (and competitive) computational medium that solves problems in new spaces and at higher scales. The harnessing of individual cell behaviors toward regulative morphogenesis (navigating anatomical morphospace), and system-level physiological robustness (traversing physiological space) are especially interesting examples. Indeed, it could be argued that a unique signature of Life is a causal architecture in which the problem-solving competency of the whole is greater than that of its parts). Evolution seems to be particularly good at finding ways to scale the cognitive light cone of cells, to achieve spectacular capabilities for gracefully and adaptively handling complexity, novelty, and noise at large scale.
>
> ... Another hallmark of collective intelligence is the ability of the higher-level agent to make decisions based on extended patterns of information." - [Collective intelligence: A unifying concept for integrating biology across scales and substrates, by Patrick McMillen & Michael Levin](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-06037-4.pdf)

> "Biology is organized as multiscale competency architecture with interactive agents navigating their respective problem spaces across scales. Lower level components implement the physical substrate for higher levels of emergent abstraction, spanning molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, to organismal and group scales. In turn, higher levels deform the free energy landscape of possible microlevel conformations through top-down behavioral shaping and signaling... Components at every level of organization perform “local” homeostatic control loops capable of handling novel stressors on the fly, yet are susceptible to hierarchical - system-level or environmental - feedback...
>
> Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) cover the essence of our current understanding of biology’s multiscale competency architecture by modeling morphogenesis through an explicitly distributed multi-agential architecture. Each cell maintains and regulates its physiological state within a local microscopic environment via successive intercellular communication and intracellular decision-making. In that way, a single cell on an NCA’s grid can initiate mophogenesis of a system level target tissue fully based on decentralized agential control-loops." - [What does evolution make? Learning in living lineages and machines, by Benedikt Hartl & and Michael Levin](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/r8z7c_v1)

> "... each individual within an MCA is an autonomous agent, actively navigating their respective environments and problem spaces. In turn, a unified approach to understanding biological self-organization is arguably rooted in localized homeostatic agents following cooperatively coordinated error correction principles.
>
> Thus, a critical missing piece in our understanding of development and evolution is the fact that cells are problem-solving agents themselves, with agendas of their own. The various competencies of cells and subcellular components, in terms of problem-solving, memory, and flexible, context-sensitive navigation of physiological and anatomical landscapes have been reviewed elsewhere. We argue that an organism’s genotype and phenotype are connected by an agential layer of irreducible physiological computation, fundamentally implemented by selforchestrated biological agents that are - at all scales - capable of dealing with novel situations on the fly. Moreover, such an MCA demonstratively impacts the process of an underlying evolutionary process operating on the structural and functional plasticity of an agential substrate, leading to more efficient and robust evolutionary and developmental search dynamics, adaptability, transferability, and evolvability.
>
> ... We propose that what evolution builds are not fixed solutions to fixed environments, but problem-solving agents, exerting well-demonstrated competencies to use genetically-provided affordances in new ways as needed. We have proposed that biology strongly leans in to the fact that it is operating on an unreliable substrate (guaranteed to change due to mutation over long timescales, and noise on short timescales), and favors architectures that take the lessons of the past seriously but not literally, and exhibit considerable regulative and creative ways to navigate their problem spaces.
>
> ... It is essential to develop a rigorous understanding of the substrate- and scale-invariant learning and creative problem-solving dynamics that tie together morphogenesis, evolution, and learning.
>
> ... The concept of an MCA is applicable across biological systems, including development, evolution, and cognitive processes: it’s agents all the way up and down, turtles both ways. In turn, this suggests a unified approach to understanding biological organization - from cells to mind - can not be explained via complexity and (nested) indirect encodings alone, but rather fundamentally rooted in collective intelligence." - [What does evolution make? Learning in living lineages and machines, by Benedikt Hartl & and Michael Levin](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/r8z7c_v1)

> "The key feature of scaling up individuality (whether evolved or engineered) is for higher levels of control to get their components to do things they do not do when operating as individual units.
>
> ... It is essential to abandon the traditional scientifc teleophobia because cybernetics and control theory now provide a mature, naturalistic, quantitative science and engineering approach to mechanisms with goals. Goals do not require magic, they require a specifc causal structure, which is ubiquitous and not restricted to complex brains.
>
> ... Biological systems exhibit cybernetic competencies in diverse problem spaces, which scale up from the most minimal behaviors of molecular components via a process of evolutionary enrichment for computational fexibility and controllability. The fact that the substrate on which evolution works is an agential material means that evolution is searching not only the space of micro-level phenotypic outcomes, but also the smoother, lower-dimensional space of behavior-shaping signals for control of modules that encapsulate complexity behind simple interfaces like the homeostatic control loop. This also allows evolution to bridge the sim-to-real gap—a problem that plagues roboticists and engineers, in which the environment is constantly surprising no matter how rich the prior training set was. In overloading the same genetic hardware with multiple interpretations, the physiological machinery of chemical and cellular networks ensures that evolution does not over-train on prior data, but compresses and generalizes. Evolution crosses the gap between prior experience and adaptive novelty by not relying too much on a lineage’s prior experience (which, like our simulations, often fail to recapitulate everything we need to know in the future), but rather by exploiting problem-solving competencies of modules at diferent scales.
>
> ... As foreseen by many workers since the beginnings of thought on evolution, intelligence is key to evolutionary change. Recent consilience of a range of disciplines are giving rise to the feld of diverse intelligence, which recognizes a spectrum of problem-solving and creative competencies in unconventional, basal media that goes beyond the old dichotomy of “dumb mechanical machine vs. high-level true intelligence”. This fnally makes it possible to incorporate a naturalistic, non-reductive, empirically useful conception of intelligence into modern theories of evolutionary change. It also naturally leads to hypotheses that whole lineages, and perhaps even the evolutionary process itself, can be viewed as proto-cognitive, cybernetic agents, by characterizing the competencies of the search dynamics using the language of cognitive and behavioral science such as active inference and Hebbian learning. What is becoming increasingly clear is that intelligence is not some latecomer that arrives with the appearance of big brains—it is baked in at the very beginning, present at multiple scales of the biological substrate of evolution, and continuously shapes its course in a fluid dance that potentiates all participants." - [Darwin’s agential materials: evolutionary implications of multiscale competency in developmental biology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-023-04790-z)

Higher levels distort the option landscape for their parts so that active agents at the lower scale are aligned and act toward setpoints in the higher level’s space.

> "... **there are no dumb parts in biology, because it is cognition all the way down**... life has agency all the way down, and every level of organization not only accommodates but actively exploits the agential nature of its components... **Life functions as a multiscale competency architecture which is not merely nested structurally into different scales, but has active agendas at each level; their autonomy is harnessed and integrated toward the goals of larger levels of which the parts have no knowledge by bending the energy landscape of parts to serve a collective.**
>
> ... **Information processed by the electrical network of neurons is widely understood as providing the “cognitive glue” – mechanisms and policies of interactions between cells that allow animals to have goals, preferences, and memories that do not belong to any of the individual cells. In other words, it enables coordination and alignment of components toward a whole that operates in new problem spaces**... Crucially, bioelectric networks are not just a communication medium for cells: much as they do in both cognitive science and computer architectures, they establish an excitable medium within which instructive information patterns can interact and compete for the opportunity to express as phenotypic outputs... This battle of anatomical models of the future (morphogenetic goal states) can be seen as a communication and signaling process between groups of cells, or, as competition between patterns encoding goal states within a medium.
>
> ... The creative interpretation of physically encoded information is a key part of the cognition all the way down formalism, unifying the plasticity of brain-based behaviors in 3D space with that of generic cell groups in anatomical space in developmental contexts. In all such cases, **living material is simultaneously solving problems at several levels of organization and scale, which requires higher levels to distort the option landscape for their parts so that active agents at the lower scale are aligned and act toward setpoints in the higher level’s space.** The relationship between one level and the next is precisely the kind of compression/decompression that involves a degree of context-sensitive confabulation, and a degree of locally-mechanistic necessity." - [Machines All the Way Up and Cognition All the Way Down: Updating the machine metaphor in biology, by Michael Levin & Richard Watson](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/jwhr7_v2)

"the vastly more complex multi-scale competency architecture of biological life cycles back and thus affects the process of evolution itself"

> "Biological systems are composed of layers of organization, each level providing the foundation for the next higher level of abstraction: membranes, DNA, and proteins form cells, which then collectively organize into tissue and, in further hierarchical steps, into tissues, organs, bodies, swarms, ecosystems, etc. Each of these layers has a degree of ability to adapt in real-time to new conditions to establish and maintain specific outcomes in terms of physiological, metabolic, transcriptional, and anatomical spaces. In other words, evolution works with material that is not passive matter but rather has a degree of competency—an agential material that forms the layer between the genotype and the phenotype... We find that competency at the cellular level of our multi-scale model system strongly affects the resulting evolutionary process, as well as the generalizability, evolvability, and transferability of the evolved solutions, suggesting the profound evolutionary implications of the highly intricate multi-scale competency architecture of biological life.

## Credit Assignment

> "The credit assignment problems inherent in collective intelligence are fundamental in all cognition and learning, and in all biological individuality... The credit assignment issues of collective intelligence are not categorically distinct from related core issues in individual adaptation, evolution and intelligence." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)

^^ what if we treat the connection between the topic of predictions and the entities doing the predicting as what strengthens over time - if the predictions are successful? Reputation

> "No individual cell has the entire experience of performing an action and reaping its benefits – that relationship only exists in the ‘group mind’ of the collective agent. How do the parts discern which of their actions should be reinforced? **Problems of distributed credit assignment are a key aspect of intelligence**... It is imperative to understand the developmental algorithms and signals by which tissue-level agents incentivise lower-level subunits (e.g. cells and molecular pathways), distorting their option space so that simple, local descent down free-energy paths (short-sighted self-interest) result in higher order adaptive activity (long-term collective interest). The key to being an individual is to have a functional structure in which diverse experiences across its components are bound together in a way that generates causal relationships and composite memories that belong to the higher space of the individual and not its components.
>
> ... It is no accident that the issue of credit assignment, and the application of credit to parts or wholes, is a central one in evolutionary selection, developmental and organismic biology and cognitive science. It is a feature of many difficult learning tasks that they require sequences of actions that are many steps away from ultimate goals – making it intrinsically difficult to incentivise the component parts involved. This is what makes difficult tasks difficult; conversely, having feedbacks that are additive and individual, is what makes easy tasks easy." - [The collective intelligence of evolution and development, by Richard Watson and Michael Levin](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/26339137231168355)




If a CEO optimizes for short term benefits in the next few years and then quits when the stock is at an ATH and cashes out but a few years later his policies of reducing R&D & optimizing for short-term profitability ultimately hurt the company - there should be a way for his reputation to be damaged retrospectively if it is later deemed that his actions doomed the company in the long term. we need better accountability & credit assignment

reinforcement:

"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.”

> "A classical learning mechanism is reinforcement, which underlies the more complex mechanism of back propagation in neural networks. Reinforcement strengthens neural connections that contribute to achieving the organism's goals, while weakening those that move it away from those goals." - [The Economy as a Distributed, Learning Control System, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/MarketControl.pdf)


we can use LLMs to go through claims within a field and do proper credit assignment when an idea is finally picked up - handling ambiguity and non-uniformness of its expression in the past. We can also trace the evolution of an idea throughout a timeline
The markets currently aggregate through liquidity and flows but what if they aggregated simply reputation and its change? Measuring fairly contribution - proper credit assignment in the collective intelligence?
proper credit assignment is important for 2 reasons: to know who to ask in the future and give more weight to their opinion, and also to motivate them
We need to sort those who stand out in helping others stand out and raising the bar for everyone else - this is credit assignment



## the wisdom of crowds and how group think can deteriorate it

how polarization and distortion of the perception of reality happens (staying in tune with your group to not stand out, simply adopting the opinion of others, extreme positions are often louder) - the order in which people speak affects the course of a discussion - forming an information cascade. The most-informed speaker is rarely the most influential (not loud or first).

> "Why does polarization occur? One reason is because of people's reliance on "social comparison." This means more than that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else (which, of course, they are). It means that people are constantly comparing themselves to everyone else with an eye toward maintaining their relative position within the group. In other words, if you start out in the middle of the group and you believe the group has moved, as it were, to the right, you're inclined to shift your position to the right as well, so that relative to everyone else you're standing still. Of course, by moving to the right you're moving the group to the right, making social comparison something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. What's assumed to be real eventually becomes real. It's important to see, though, that polarization isn't just the result of people trying to stay in tune with the group. It also results, strangely, from people doing their best to figure out what the right answer is. As we saw in our discussion of social proof—remember the passersby who ended up staring into an empty sky—people who are uncertain about what they believe will look to other members of the group for help. That's the point of deliberating, after all. But if a majority of the group already supports one position, then most of the arguments that will be made will be in support of that position. So the uncertain people are likely to be swayed in that direction, in part simply because that's more of what they'll hear. Similarly, people who have more extreme positions are more likely to have strong, coherent arguments in favor of their positions and are also more likely to voice them. This matters because all the evidence suggests that the order in which people speak has a profound effect on the course of a discussion. Earlier comments are more influential, and they tend to provide a framework within which the discussion occurs. As in an information cascade, once that framework is in place, it's difficult for a dissenter to break it down. This wouldn't be a problem if the people who spoke earliest were also more likely to know what they were talking about. But the truth is that, especially when it comes to problems where there is no obvious right answer, there's no guarantee that the most-informed speaker will also be the most influential. On juries, for instance, two-thirds of all foremen—who lead and structure deliberations—are men, and during deliberations men talk far more than women do, even though no one has ever suggested that men as a gender have better insight into questions of guilt and innocence. In groups where the members know each other, status tends to shape speaking patterns, with higher-status people talking more and more often than lower-status people." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Why%20does%20polarization,lower%2Dstatus%20people.)

Talkative == listened to & influential (even if not liked). Feedback: the more someone talks, the more people talk to him. "There is no clear correlation between talkativeness and expertise".

> "Talkativeness may seem like a curious thing to worry about, but in fact talkativeness has a major impact on the kinds of decisions small groups reach. If you talk a lot in a group, people will tend to think of you as influential almost by default. Talkative people are not necessarily well liked by other members of the group, but they are listened to. And talkativeness feeds on itself. Studies of group dynamics almost always show that the more someone talks, the more he is talked to by others in the group. So people at the center of the group tend to become more important over the course of a discussion. This might be okay if people only spoke when they had expertise in a particular matter. And in many cases, if someone's talking a lot, it's a good sign that they have something valuable to add. But the truth is that there is no clear correlation between talkativeness and expertise." - [The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki](https://www.sweetstudy.com/files/jamessurowiecki-thewisdomofcrowds-anchor2005-pdf#:~:text=Talkativeness%20may%20seem,tiveness%20and%20expertise.)

## Group Agency

<!--
> "... suitably organized collectives can be intentional agents in their own right, over and above their individual members. Examples of group agents include commercial corporations, collegial courts, non-governmental organizations, even states in their entirety. Like an individual human being, a group agent has purposes and intentions and pursues these through its actions. In doing so, it can be as rational as an individual rational agent, at least when we understand rationality in the way decision theorists do. For example, a firm’s behaviour in the market place can be well understood by modeling it as a rational utility maximizer, and corporations often fit the model of homo economicus better – and to a scarier extent – than most individual human beings do..." - [What is it like to be a group agent? by Christian List](https://philarchive.org/rec/LISWII)
-->

> "What is a group agent? ... it may be tempting to define a group agent ... by specifying how several individuals must act together in order to form a group agent. However, a more parsimonious approach is to begin with a general definition of an agent, and then to apply it to the case of groups. **A group agent... is a collective that qualifies as an agent.** The practical question of how a collective can achieve this status – organizationally, institutionally, behaviourally – is separate from the definitional question of what a group agent is.
>
> So, what is an agent? It is helpful to use a functionalist definition, based on the traditional belief-desire model. Functionalism about agency, in very rough terms, is the view that **what makes a system an agent** – and what generates its intentional states – is nothing heavily metaphysically loaded, but **simply the way the system functions... an agent is a system that has:**
>
> • **representational states or “beliefs”**, whose functional role is to depict certain features of the environment as the system “takes them to be”;
>
> • **motivational states or “desires”**, whose functional role is to depict certain features of the environment as the system “would like them to be”; and
>
> • **a capacity to intervene in the environment on the basis of these states**, i.e., to “act” in pursuit of its “desires” in line with its “beliefs”.
>
> ... the conditions are quite minimal, and the systems satisfying them may vary greatly in agential capacities and sophistication. In principle, even a thermostat might qualify as an agent in a very basic sense: it has “beliefs” about the actual temperature, “desires” about the target temperature, and a capacity to “act” by regulating the heating (a well-known observation at least since Dennett’s 1987 work on the “intentional stance”). But nothing much is gained from viewing it this way, since a more straightforward mechanistic explanation is available.
>
> Now, whether a group can meet the conditions for agency depends on how it is organized. **A random collective – say the collection of shoppers who happen to be in the supermarket at this moment – lacks the required structure. But a suitably organized collective can in principle meet the conditions.** The examples I have mentioned – firms, courts, NGOs, and so on – are all of this kind. Whichever states of an organized collective play the functional roles of beliefs and desires will then qualify as the collective’s intentional states: the corporate beliefs and desires.
>
> ... **it is important to distinguish the phenomenon of group agency from the related phenomenon of joint agency. We speak of joint agency whenever two or more individuals engage in some joint action.** For example, they go for a walk together, carry a piano downstairs together, or undertake some common project. Clearly, some shared or joint intentions (or intentions that are suitably collectively directed) need to be present among the participants in order to make joint actions possible... **joint agency is not the same as group agency... Two or more individuals who engage in a joint action do not necessarily bring into existence a group agent.** We can make sense of joint actions without ascribing a single “centre” of belief, desire, and agency to the group in its entirety. **It is sufficient for a joint action that the bearers of the underlying intentions are individuals; no group-level intentional states are needed.** Of course, there may be joint actions within the context of a group agent. The practical mechanisms of forming a group agent may often include shared or joint intentions among the individual members. But **joint agency is neither sufficient, nor (from purely logical perspective) even necessary, for group agency.**" - [What is it like to be a group agent? by Christian List](https://philarchive.org/rec/LISWII)

## All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence

> "The great cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky observed that what we call “intelligence” is not a singular thing; rather, it is an emergent phenomenon that arises from the collective interactions of many individual parts. The magic of intelligence is that when those parts are organized in a particular way, they can do things that no individual part could do on its own. Minsky called this description of intelligence “the society of mind.”" - [The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22456.The_Origin_of_Wealth)

> "The evolution of brains is a story of increasingly coordinated collective behavior, driven by the emergence of more efficient forms of intercellular communication, increasing differentiation and specialization of cell types, increasing interdependence, and progressive refinement of organization. At each stage, the benefits achieved through cooperation must have outweighed the costs of increased competition for resources that comes with sharing territory. Thus, we view brains as one end of a continuum of collective behavior wherein the collective has become especially coordinated and complex in organization.
>
> ... **Neural structure is not hard-coded into the genes — indeed, there couldn’t possibly be enough information in the human genome to encode neural structure — but instead is robustly reproduced time and again through these competitive dynamics.** Malfunction of these processes (i.e., overproduction of neurons or lack of pruning) is associated with a number of brain disorders. Along these lines, proponents of “Neural Darwinism” and related views suggest that **brain development, and intelligence more generally, can be understood as analogous to the evolution of a species through variation and selection.**
>
> ... Competitive dynamics are crucial both in brain development and in “online” cognition and behavior. We suggest that **it is the precise parameterization of such competition dynamics that contributes to the intelligence of the brain.** As such, we believe these mechanisms are best understood as a form of collective decision-making.
>
> ... **Functional networks are known to form and dissipate rapidly** — on the order of milliseconds in visual processing, or on the timescale of minutes in skill acquisition — in a process that is often called “soft-assembly”. This process is best understood as **a form of self-organization, in that the best functional network for a task or context comes online through distributed interactions, rather than by virtue of a central executive that assembles the best neural partners after assessing a situation... We suggest that the dynamic reorganization of functional subnetworks in the brain and the massive interactivity of the brain is best understood through the lens of collective intelligence, akin to a crowd that efficiently forms an effective committee for each task on the fly... The intelligence of brains is due not to precisely designed neural circuits that implement specific computations, but instead due to an intrinsic capacity for collections of neurons to spontaneously organize in service of survival of the group... The structure and development of the brain is characterized by highly efficient and robust mechanisms of competition, cooperation, consensus building, and dynamic reconfiguration of neural coalitions**... Humans may have much to learn from neurons about constructing harmonious societies... **Collective intelligence in humans actually has little to do with how intelligent we are as individuals, and instead to the extent to which we are evolutionarily prepared for spontaneous interpersonal coordination**... Any question about adaptation on a population level becomes one of collective intelligence.
>
> ... In a formulation of the “local knowledge problem,” Hayek argued that local, dispersed, and incomplete knowledge held by individuals within a market system allow for the rapid adaptation of the market to inputs and outputs in the economy. Hayek saw the emergence of a central intelligence, in the form of the price system, as being one way in which distributed systems create the appearance of a central actor.
>
> ... **There is little reason to expect collective intelligence to be restricted to any particular species or spatio-temporal scale of activity.**
>
> ... **A brain is a collection of living cells struggling for survival. By virtue of mechanisms of competition, such as synaptogenesis/pruning and mutual inhibition, and mechanisms of cooperation, such as energy sharing through spiking behavior, these collections of cells are able to rapidly self-organize into different patterns of functional connectivity that are adaptive at the group level with respect to a current task and context.**" - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)




even if we achieve a 1000x more powerful reasoning model than what we currently have, it would still benefit from a distributed architecture for interaction and incentive alignment with copies of itself - because of energy/space/time limits it would benefit from breaking down tasks into subtasks that it delegates and orchestrates. All intelligence is collective intelligence
Everything boils down to aggregating/integrating and aligning pockets of intelligence

> "Think about it. You get information inputs from journalists, from friends, from those you follow, from the websites you visit, the shows you watch, the conversations you participate on… You then process that information, by either thinking or intuition. And you output your own information signal by talking, writing, drawing… Others then go on and consume your output, to form their own thoughts, and create their own output.
>
> ... Some edges (connections between nodes, between neurons, between you and other people) are stronger than others, like the people you follow more closely and with whom you exchange the longest posts. Others are weaker, like the person that appears on your feed every now to post a vacation picture you end up “liking”. Some neurons are more broadcasters: they have unidirectional connections to millions of other people who listen to what they have to say, but they don’t listen much in return. Others might be the opposite: they follow plenty of people, but don’t never participate, so they don’t influence other neurons much.
>
> ... TikTok creates a brain that uniformizes neurons at an ever-accelerating speed, creates superbroadcasting neurons, and makes the rest of neurons ever more addicted to interacting with the rest of the brain.
>
> ... Twitter: It shows first the tweets from those you follow, and it decays their importance very quickly with time: a tweet from 2 days ago will be buried in somebody’s feed. That promotes people coming back very frequently so they’re in the know. It also pushes people to post content superfrequently. And that makes Twitter more a real-time network than, say, LinkedIn. Responses are much more prominent than on TikTok, which invites debate—there’s very little debate on TikTok, so it’s more a broadcasting site. But the debate on Twitter is very linear: all the responses to a tweet are nested into the first tweet, ranked mostly by recency, which doesn’t invite for thoughtful conversation, but rather fast conversation. You can’t have thoughtful and fast conversations at the same time, so conversations on Twitter tend to quickly descend into chaos. You have 3 ways of getting distribution on Twitter: through more Likes, Retweets, and Responses. Which means that different behaviors are incentivized. For Retweets, you want soundbites that people feel good about endorsing with their own identity. That is great to spur identity politics, for example. Lots of Responses also get your tweet distribution: another way to incentivize debate and polarization. Getting only likes is the weakest of the 3. Meanwhile, Likes don’t get you as much distribution. But Likes are by far the thing that people do most when they want to show compassion, for example. As a result, Twitter fosters more debate and polemic than compassion. That’s why it is a fast, aggressive, noisy brain. It’s impossible to use this brain for thoughtful debate.
>
> ... Humans are humans. We’re able of the best and the worst, and most of that is simply defined by the environment. Our brains are the same as those of Homo Sapiens killing each other 50,000 years ago in Africa. What changes is the influences that surround us. We’re neurons in a brain. Change how we’re connected to each other, you’ll change the brain.
>
> ... You’re also a neuron for your company whenever you do knowledge work in it. Each person is a neuron in this brain. You bring information from outside and from inside of the company, process it in your individual work, and communicate it back with your deliverables. In the process, you coordinate with many other neurons—people. Each meeting can be seen as a group of neurons lighting together, exchanging information. Your dendrites (your sources of information) go to all the people you hang out with or meet. Your work network. Your axones (the channel with information you send out) go to all the people you share information with—which might not always be the same group. Through these processes emerge the big decisions that companies make: what other companies to buy, what strategy to follow, how to spend their money, who to hire (=what neurons to add to the network), their product design, their marketing…
>
> ... The role of a manager is not to understand each one of the neural connections, but rather to look at the patterns in the network, and correct them when they are incomplete. For example, when some teams don’t talk to each other—or when they talk too much—, when a group doesn’t have enough autonomy, when a group of neurons doesn’t have enough knowledge about certain disciplines to process their signals proficiently…

> "In brains, the more a neuron pays attention to another neuron, the more likely it is to propagate its message. Even if it doesn’t pay that much attention to a neuron, if it receives the same message from many other neurons, it will propagate it too. On Twitter, you're more likely to retweet something from somebody you pay attention to, or if many have retweeted it already. In a brain, the more a certain pathway between neurons fires up, the stronger it will become. The axons and dendrites strengthen. Eventually, some groups of neurons start firing up very close to each other, following each other's behavior. They form a brain subsystem. On Twitter, the more you like somebody's tweets, the more you're likely to follow them. You'll tend to form groups with the ppl who follow the same ppl and topics & have the same opinions. You'll RT each other. You form a Twitter subsystem." - [The Democracy of the Future, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/future-of-democracy-decentralized)

## more collective intelligence in governance instead of increasing "democracy"

> "Governance is, in many ways, the most important question of all... By “design principle” I basically mean a feature of a governance system, but—again—not “implemented from above”; rather, a design principle is a recognizable pattern that grants a sense of direction to the larger process of cultivating new forms of governance. Basically, I hold that we are to ask ourselves for each change: “Is this particular development in line with our design principles?” ... let’s give a definition of “governance” before we proceed:
>
> **Governance is the capacity of humans to weave their individual streams-of-action into coordinated wholes, so that actions form chains that are coordinated across time and space, in a manner increasing the likelihood of desirable results and decreasing the likelihood of undesirable results.** And if you wish to add another layer to it: **Governance includes the coordination of human communicative actions that determine which results are desirable and undesirable.**
>
> ... the philosopher Magnus Vinding, suggests in his new book, Reasoned Politics, that “politics” has two layers: a values layer (establishing what we want and why) and an empirical layer (establishing what is true about getting where we want, so as to inform policy and action). I think that works well: governance, in a comprehensive sense, is about coordinating actions, including establishing the values from which we govern and agree to being governed.
>
> **Design Principle 1:** Don’t ask how to make governance “more democratic”; ask how to increase collective intelligence
>
> ... If by “more democracy” we mean that “more people get a greater say in more issues”, there is indeed no reason to believe that we should seek to attain that goal. As argued in Democracy For Realists (see [here](https://casparoesterheld.com/2017/06/18/summary-of-achen-and-bartelsdemocracy-for-realists/) for a summary), you often get worse result for everyone involved by simply expanding how many people are directly involved in decision-making.
>
> In that sense, then, “more democracy” is often the last thing you want. What we usually mean by “more democracy in the world” is not to involve as many people as possible in as many decisions as possible, but rather the cultivation of a number of interrelated institutions that tend to remove power imbalances and the obvious misuse of power. This makes it appear as though getting more people involved in more decisions, because the less democratic societies are also the worse governed ones, but this is manifestly untrue—it’s a so-called “[spurious relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship)”.
>
> The underlying principle is simply that fewer distortions of information and suppression of voices and interests tends to create more intelligent and tenable decisions.
>
> [Collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) is the capacity of a group to solve shared problems... we can all understand that some groups (or collectives or organizations) will be better able to solve common problems than others, and that this must reasonably be the case also for societies at large—even for civilizations.
>
> All I am saying with this design principle is that there is no reason to seek to “increase democracy” in and of itself, for its own sake. There is no “democracy god” that will punish us if we don’t. Democracy is good because it increases collective intelligence (and mitigates collective stupidity)—until it isn’t and doesn’t.
>
> Hence, the four great strands of democratic decision making: direct democracy, representative democracy, participatory democracy, and deliberative democracy cannot be viewed as inherently practically or morally superior to one another. Rather, you need to see which types of decisions can reasonably be made by which forms of democratic governance.
>
> To increase collective intelligence often means to move complex decisions into the realm of participatory and deliberative democracies—i.e. involving stakeholders and creating citizen councils selected by sortition (lottery) to discuss a matter before a policy is decided upon. In a way, this means that fewer people get a say which might seem “less democratic”—but at the same time, a richer and more nuanced picture can come to the fore, and this in turn means that people’s opinions on a matter can less easily be manipulated by smaller elites or interest groups. With such developments, we move towards “less democracy”, and certainly fewer instances of voting, but hopefully towards greater collective intelligence." - [3 Design Principles for Protopian Governance, by Hanzi Freinacht](https://metamoderna.org/3-design-principles-for-protopian-governance/)


<details><summary>General Collective Intelligence</summary><p>

> "A General Collective Intelligence is a schematic for a software platform that would be hypothetically able to exponentially increase the general problem-solving ability (intelligence) of a group through replicating the way natural systems compute solutions. An organism can be thought of as a system of computation able to optimize its outcomes as an individual. Assume a bird contains 500 million cells. A set of single-celled organisms has never been observed to have the ability to spontaneously organize themselves to fly. To 500 million single-celled organisms, flight is not a reliably solvable problem. They do not have a collective problem-solving process powerful enough to come up with a solution like flight. If finding food requires flight, then achieving that outcome becomes a "wicked” problem that is not reliably solvable. Furthermore, even if presented with the exact solution for how they must work together to achieve flight, those 500 million single-celled organisms cannot even reliably evaluate that solution to be correct. While multicellularity is not novel, the representation of multicellular cooperation as one of a number of adaptive problem-solving domains within which natu‐ ral systems have general problem-solving ability that might be copied is new. The model of General Collective Intelligence referred to here introduces this collective general problem-solving ability to human groups so that far more complex problems can reliably be solved.
>
> From the perspective of General Collective Intelligence, a key challenge with medical or other decision making in groups is that when the order of complexity of problems increases past the capacity of the collective intelligence of the group, it is hypothesized that only individual intelligence, and therefore only individual interests, can reliably drive collective decision-making. If so, then without GCI, the only stable balance (i.e. the only reliably achievable outcome), regardless of which decision system groups (including entire societies) are organized by, is for individuals or organizations to compete to further the interests of some centralized (individual) entity (i.e. some individual or organization such as a pharmaceutical or vaccine company). The only difference be‐ tween decision systems from this perspective is where benefit (or inequality) accumulates as a result, which might influence which interventions a given health care policy will tend to advocate.
>
> On the other hand, there are potentially patterns of cooperation that create a sufficient amount of value that the stable balance might change to instead become cooperating to maximize collective outcomes. But where such patterns of cooperation are too complex, policymakers might not even be aware of them, and in addition, such complex patterns of cooperation cannot reliably be executed by a group of individuals without GCI and therefore aren’t available as options.
>
> In addition to difficulties with coordinating decision-making, a second key challenge is polarization. There are two modes of thinking according to cognitive psychologists, namely, type 1 (fast or intuitive) reasoning, and type 2 (slow or rational methodical) reasoning, which reflect two problem-solving strategies that are both necessary. Type 1 reasoning solves noncomputable problems by recalling patterns of solutions observed in the past where those solutions can't be computed currently. Type 2 reasoning solves computable problems through some methodical process such as evaluating an equation. Because there is no process by which the answer to a non-computable problem can be computed, type 1 reasoning and type 2 reasoning simply cannot be reconciled. Each individual uses both type 1 and type 2 reasoning, the difference lies in which problems each reasoning type is applied to and the dynamics of each reasoning style in groups. Type 1 thinking reliably allows convergence on a common conclusion. Some of the indicators of type 1 thinking (i.e. judging truth by patterns observed in the past by oneself or by trusted sources) are relying on what "experts" say, or relying on what the "consensus" is. Type 1 thinking results in calling information "misinformation" when no consensus of experts has rendered an opinion, which is different from no expert opinions existing.
>
> ... Type 2 thinking can come to any conclusion and does not reliably converge. If type 2 thinking is like using an "equation", one can use any equation, one can plug any information into the equation, and individuals can differ in capacity to evaluate the equation. That this reasoning is “methodical” does not equate with it being correct. One can use the wrong equation, one can plug the wrong information into the equation, and one can evaluate the equation incorrectly. Where type 1 thinking reliably creates a path to a single conclusion type 2 reasoning can end up anywhere. Anecdotally, some common hallmarks of type 1 thinking are trying to insert what the group might consider fringe opinions or even "misinformation" into the conversation.
>
> ... If it is true that all conclusions must be biased towards type 1 or type 2 reasoning, then since this bias is innate, the only way to eliminate this bias is to embrace it, make better use of it. Increasing our collective intelligence means being able to consider what some would call fake information because the information that is eventually considered mainstream might often emerge on the fringes. But increasing our collective intelligence also means being able to rely on consensus, which completely discards information on the fringe. In collective cognition, groups must be able to apply type 1 reasoning where it is optimal and to apply type 2 reasoning where it is optimal, just as within an individual mind, thereby creating the capacity to reliably converge on a single optimal solution to each problem and to do so for problems of far greater complexity. If able to do so, GCI introduces the possibility of bridging the cognitive bias divide (which also reflects a left-right or in the US a democrat-republican political divide). Case studies in other domains suggest GCI has the potential to significantly increase the impact on collective outcomes per program dollar, as compared with any current or proposed policies, whether proposed by those having a left-leaning cognitive bias, or those having a right-leaning cognitive bias. For all these reasons General Collective Intelligence might be one of the most important areas of research in public health today." - [General Collective Intelligence and Systemic Error in Groups, by Gregg Henriques & Andy Williams](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/202106/general-collective-intelligence-and-systemic-error-in-groups)

> "Stigmergy: a form of indirect coordination via the medium, where the trace left by an action in the medium stimulates the performance of a subsequent action, thus building further on the work that has already been done. Examples of stigmergic interaction are termites collectively building a termite hill by adding mud to heaps left by other termites, ants mapping out their territory by leaving trails of pheromone that lead other ants to food sources, and people adding their insights to the writings of others, thus collaboratively developing an encyclopedia (Wikipedia) on the web. Stigmergy is typically the result of the self-organization of a mediator out of the medium. It is probably the simplest way to achieve coordination in a complex system because it does not make any cognitive demands on the agents (such as remembering who is to do what when), and therefore functions even with agents of very low intelligence, such as insects. It also does not require any relationship, communication or even direct interaction between the agents: contributors to a Wikipedia page typically have no idea who the other contributors are, yet their contributions are seamlessly integrated into the emerging whole." - [Self-organization of complex, intelligent systems: an action ontology for transdisciplinary integration, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ECCO-paradigm.pdf)

<!-- > "The basis of its success (Wikipedia) is [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a mechanism of self-organizing coordination between independent agents. The principle is that the work of one individual (e.g. an edit of a Wikipedia text) leaves a public trace (e.g. a change in the corresponding web page) that can stimulate one or more other individuals to continue the work (e.g. add further details or correct wrong assumptions). Thus, independent contributions build further the one on top of the other, producing a collective result much richer and more complex than could have been achieved via any traditional, centralized form of organization. There are no obvious limits to such a self-amplifying process of contributions eliciting further contributions." - [Return to Eden? Promises and Perils on the Road to a Global Superintelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/BrinkofSingularity.pdf) -->

> "The potential for theoretical explanation and practical application of the stigmergy concept is much larger still than hitherto assumed. What (Parunak, 2006) noted about human institutions, that the more difficult issue is to find examples where stigmergy does not apply, extends to complex systems in general, and in particular to systems that exhibit some form of cognition, cooperation, or organization that is the result of evolution. When properly defined, the mechanism of stigmergy appears to be nearly ubiquitous, and able to illuminate a variety of conceptual problems in a non-trivial manner." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "Compared to traditional methods of organization, stigmergy makes absolutely minimal demands on the agents. In particular, in stigmergic collaboration there is no need for:
>
> • planning or anticipation: agents only need to know the present state of the activity; the overall goal, next step or end result is irrelevant for their present work. In Wikipedia, there is no plan specifying which information should be added to the encyclopedia when.
>
> • memory: agents do not need to remember their previous activity; no information about the state of the work needs to be stored anywhere except in the medium.
>
> • communication: no information needs to be transferred between the agents, except via the work done in the medium; there is in particular no need for the agents to negotiate about who does what.
>
> • mutual awareness: each agent works independently; it does not even need to know that others participate. For example, contributors to Wikipedia generally do not know each other or communicate with each other.
>
> • simultaneous presence: there is in general no need for the agents to be present at the same time or at the same place; tasks are registered in the medium so that they can be picked up by agents whenever and wherever they are available. That is how worldwide communities can collaborate on a single software project.
>
> • imposed sequence: actions are performed automatically in the right order, since an action will not be started until the right condition is in place; the workflow emerges spontaneously, as the completion of one task triggers the initiation of the next task(s)
>
> • imposed division of labor: each agent will only perform the actions for which it has the required competence, i.e. for which it possesses adequate condition-action rules; normally, the more “confident” the agent is about the right action (i.e. the stronger the connection between condition and action), the more it will be stimulated by the condition, and the quicker it will be to start the job; in this way, tasks are automatically assigned to the most competent agents
>
> • commitment: agents do no need to commit to a particular task (in contradiction to what (Jennings, 1993) claims about multi-agent coordination); an agent decides on the spot what work it should do, depending on opportunity and other contingent conditions; an agent that quits or otherwise becomes unavailable is automatically replaced by another one
>
> • centralized control or supervision: errors or perturbations are automatically corrected, as they merely create a new condition stimulating new actions to deal with the challenge; the activity is self-organizing: global organization emerges from local interactions, without any centralized control directing the activity. For example, bugs in open-source software are spotted by users, and resolved by other contributors." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

number of agents, single vs. many

> "Another, even more common misunderstanding is that stigmergy only concerns groups or swarms consisting of many agents. As we will show, stigmergy is just as important for understanding the behavior of a single individual." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The number of agents collaborating on a stigmergic project is actually much less fundamental than it may seem. The essence of the activity is always the same. Assuming that the agents have the same competencies, adding more agents merely increases manpower and therefore the size of the problem that can be tackled, the speed of advance, or the eventual magnitude of the achievement. Only when the agents are diverse can an increase in their number produce a qualitative improvement in the solution.
>
> The only complication added is that agents may get in each other's way, in the sense that similar individuals perceiving the same stimulus are likely to move to the same place at the same time, thus obstructing each other's actions. This problem is easily tackled by an additional rule, which is already implicit in individual work but likely to become reinforced during collaborative work: keep a minimum distance from obstacles—including other agents. This rule is a well-known ingredient in the many successful simulations of collectively moving animals, such as flocks, schools or swarms, allowing densely packed groups of agents to follow complex, synchronized trajectories without ever bumping into each other." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

quantitative vs. qualitative

> "Quantitative stigmergy ranks or prioritizes existing possibilities for action, thus helping agents to choose the action that is most likely to be beneficial. Qualitative stigmergy creates potential for action by changing the medium in such a way that novel possibilities arise." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

> "Quantitative stigmergy refers to perceived conditions that differ in strength or degree, and where stronger traces typically elicit more forceful (intense, frequent, …) actions. This quantitative variation is perhaps best captured using my definition of stimulation in terms of conditional probability: the stronger the trace, the larger the probability of a certain action given that trace. Over an extended period, higher probability implies more frequent actions by more numerous agents, and therefore more intense overall activity. The two paradigmatic cases of stigmergy, termite nest-building and ant trail-laying, follow this quantitative logic. The higher the emerging heap of mud (stronger trace), the more an individual termite is attracted to it, and therefore the larger the probability or frequency of mud being added. The stronger the scent of pheromone on a trail, the less likely an ant is to deviate from that trail, and therefore the higher the probability that it too will reinforce the trail with additional pheromone. These are typical examples of the positive feedback that efficiently amplifies positive developments.
>
> But quantitative stigmergy can also be exemplified by negative feedback, where a stronger trace leads to less activity. A human example can be found in the market mechanism. Extensive buying of a good (action) reduces the supply and thus increases the price, which is a quantitative trace left by the collective buying and selling activity. A higher price will normally reduce the probability that someone would buy additional stock of that good (negative stimulation). Thus, a higher price reduces demand, which in turn will reduce the price. This mechanism of self-organizing, distributed control implements the “invisible hand” of the market. It stabilizes prices and efficiently allocates production capacity to the goods that are most in demand.
>
> Qualitative stigmergy refers to conditions and actions that differ in kind rather than in degree. In this case, a different trace stimulates a different type of action. An example can be found in the different stages of the building of a funnel-shaped nest by the solitary wasp that we discussed, where each stage requires a particular type of building action. A human example can be found in “wiki” websites that are edited by their own readers. A paragraph that contains a semantic mistake (e.g. in the definition of a word) will elicit a corrective action (e.g. writing a new definition). Different types of errors, vagueness, or lack of information will stimulate different types of additions and corrections." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

<!-- > "Stigmergy exhibits another fundamental “signature” of self-organization: positive feedback. Error-controlled regulation assumes negative feedback: the reduction of deviations away from the goal. However, goal-directed action can also make use of positive feedback: the amplification of movements towards the goal." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf) -->

> "The basic mechanism whereby useful paths are gradually reinforced, and less useful ones weakened, provides a very general heuristic to tackle a variety of problems. It can be seen as a quantitative, stigmergic instantiation of the mechanism of evolution itself: maintain and grow the fit (useful); reduce, and eventually eliminate, the unfit...
>
> Furthermore, the same mechanism seems to underlie learning in the brain: neuronal connections that are successfully used become stronger; the others become weaker. It is this analogy that initially inspired me to conceive of the World-Wide Web as a potential Global Brain. The web is a distributed network of documents connected by hyperlinks along which people travel (“surf”) from page to page... when people surfing the web end up in a particularly interesting page, they are likely to create one or more new links from their own pages pointing directly to it, thus shortcutting the long sequence they followed before finding it. This increases the number of links to the page, and the probability that other people would encounter it. The overall effect is captured by Google’s PageRank algorithm, which provides a measure of the importance of a website as determined by the links directly or indirectly pointing to it. This is another example of quantitative stigmergy: the actions of many independent agents (people inserting links) on a shared medium (the web) produce a collective ranking (PageRank) that helps other agents find the options (documents) most likely to be useful to them." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

sematectonic vs. marker-based stigmergy

> "This type of indirect stimulation, not by the work itself but by a specially evolved “side-effect”, has been called marker-based stigmergy. The evolution of markers is an obvious method to make stigmergy more efficient, by more reliably focusing the agents' attention on the most relevant aspects of the work that needs to be done. However, it entails an extra cost and complication in that individuals need to perform the task of manufacturing markers in addition to the work itself. A human example can be found in the Wikipedia encyclopedia on the web. Readers are stimulated to improve existing pages either directly, by reading the text and noticing its shortcomings, or indirectly, by reading comments that summarize the tasks that still need to be done—such as adding references, clarifying ambiguous sections, or checking facts. The direct method exemplifies sematectonic stigmergy, the indirect one marker-based stigmergy. The “markers” in this case are the various “to do” notes that attract the attention to the problems that still require work. A marker can be seen as an abstract, conventional sign, intentionally representing the work to be done instead of mechanically registering its effects. In Peirce's semiotic taxonomy of signs, a marker is a symbol, while a sematectonic trace is an index. As such, a marker may seem to belong to a higher-order semiotic or communicative category of phenomena—a “meta-level” compared to the “object level” of the work itself." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

the "learning"/"forgetting" parameter - determining the intensity of new contributions to a trace

> "This is the same phenomenon of selective “forgetting” that characterizes memory in the brain: neural connections that are no longer reinforced will gradually lose their strength relative to recently reinforced ones. The speed of this forgetting depends on the learning parameter, as defined in neural networks. A large value of the parameter means that new changes in connection strength are large relative to the cumulative effect of previous ones, thus promoting the speedy establishment of new memory traces—but also the quick obsolescence of older traces. A small value, on the other hand, means that older learning episodes continue to exert a strong effect. A similar parameter probably controls the external memory of ants as laid down in pheromone trails: newly added pheromone should be strong enough to allow trails towards newly found food sources to eventually become more attractive than previously found ones; yet, it should not be so strong that some recent journeys by ants carrying food from a new, unproven source can overpower the signals pointing to an older source whose reliability is evidenced by hundreds of successful journeys. Given that what counts is the relative attractiveness of different options for action, the “learning” parameter, which determines the intensity of new contributions to the trace, is in practice equivalent to a “forgetting” parameter, which determines the rate of decay of the existing trace. The optimal value of this parameter will depend on the speed with which information becomes obsolete." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

persistent vs. transient traces - asynchronous vs. synchronous

> "No sharp distinction can be made between persistent and transient traces used in stigmergy: these are merely the opposite ends of a continuum. Yet, the distinction may be useful for conceptual clarification. Persistent traces lead to what may be called asynchronous stigmergy: the different agents or productions do not need to be present at the same time, since the trace remains to guide them at any later time. Asynchronous communication can be illustrated by media such as print, email, or websites. Its advantage is that information remains available, so that it can be processed at the most appropriate occasion, and can accumulate and mature over the longer term. Transient traces lead to synchronous stigmergy: the agents need to be simultaneously present for the coordination to succeed.
>
> Synchronous communication may be exemplified by media such as telephone and Internet “chat”. Its advantage is that interaction, and therefore feedback, is instantaneous, so that disturbances and coordination errors can be corrected without delay. Synchronous communication is rarely conceived as stigmergic, since it is typically used for direct interaction, such as conversation or discussion. Yet, a warning cry or a chemical signal exemplify indirect interaction: they are targeted at no one in particular but merely “released” in the medium. Examples of stigmergy in synchronous interaction are even clearer when the signal is sematectonic. For example, a bird spotting a danger (condition) will start to fly (action), and by this example (transient trace) set off the whole flock to fly away (subsequent action). Synchronous stigmergy may be best exemplified by the collective movement in herds, flocks or swarms, where the agents are continually adjusting their trajectory on the basis of real-time perceptions of the movements of other agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

broadcast vs. narrowcast

> "A one-dimensional, quantitative aspect: the range or scope of the stigmergic process. The scope represents the size of the “neighborhood” across which a stigmergic signal is perceivable. The two poles of the scope continuum may be called broadcast and narrowcast. Broadcasted traces can be perceived by all agents involved. Narrowcasted traces are perceivable by only one or a few agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "The situation becomes more complex—but also more interesting—when different actions or agents have a different scope, so that A's traces e.g. may reach B, C and D, while D's traces reach B and E. In this case, the topology of the stigmergic medium becomes equivalent to a network where different nodes (A, B, C…) each are connected to (i.e. can deposit traces perceivable by) different other nodes. The implication is that the network paradigm—which is increasingly popular for modeling various complex and self-organizing systems such as neural networks, social networks, citation networks, etc.—could be viewed as a special case of the stigmergic paradigm, albeit a rather complicated one." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

cognition

> "Next to its general function of coordination, stigmergy in particular supports cognition and cooperation. Traditionally, cognition has been viewed as the processing of information inside the brain. More recent approaches, however, note that both the information and the processing often reside in the outside world—or what we have called the medium. For example, documents function as an external memory for storing knowledge and data, while calculations are typically performed on a piece of paper or on a calculator. Without such supporting media, most advanced reasoning—as performed e.g. in science and technology—would be simply impossible. Thus, the human mind extends into the environment, “outsourcing” some of its functions to external support systems. The reason is that our memory and information processing capabilities have rather strict limitations—most famously the “magical number 7 plus or minus 2” which denotes the maximum number of items we can hold in short-term memory. Books and computers are relatively recent inventions. However, the use of an external medium for supporting cognition is probably as old as cognition itself. More precisely, our mental capabilities can be seen as an interiorization of what were initially stigmergic interactions with the environment." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

cooperation

> "In the stigmergic paradigm, the common good (e.g. Wikipedia, or a network of trails and roads connecting common destinations) is gradually built up via the cooperation implicit in stigmergically coordinated actions. Free riders may profit from this common good without putting in any effort in return. However, the benefit derived from a stigmergic trace does not in general reduce the value of that trace. For example, an ant that follows a pheromone trace laid by others without adding pheromone of its own does not by that action make the pheromone trace less useful to the other ants. Similarly, a person who downloads a piece of open source software without contributing to the development of that software does not impose any burden on the software developers. Thus, in a situation of stigmergy, a free rider or “defector” does not weaken the cooperators, in contrast to situations like the Prisoners’ dilemma or Tragedy of the Commons.
>
> In a sense, by not contributing the free riding agent merely weakens its own position, because it passes by the opportunity to adapt the trace to its own preferences. As we saw, the stigmergic trace is the aggregate of many independent actions, each of which helps the agent that performed it to achieve its goals. The ant that finds food but does not leave a pheromone trace on its way back to the nest not only does not help others to get to that food: it also does not help itself, because without the trace it is very unlikely to find the same food source again. The trace is both an individual and a collective “mental map” that indicates effective actions. Not leaving a trace makes your own future work harder than it needs to be." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

> "In the short run, the free rider may seem to have the benefit over the cooperator of spending less energy establishing and maintaining the trace. However, the cooperator collects other benefits. First, as we noted with the ant leaving pheromone or the hiker breaking off branches, the cooperating agent helps itself by creating a trace. Second, the stigmergic interaction will boost the benefits of that individual trace by stimulating others to expand on it. For example, an ant creating a trail to a new food source will incite others to explore the neighborhood of that source, potentially discovering even better sources or shorter trails. Similarly, the hiker who partially cleared a path will thus increase the probability of others following that same path while performing further clearing themselves. This is the positive feedback of actions eliciting more actions that makes stigmergy so effective. The free rider simply misses out on this potential amplification of its actions." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

coordination, self-organization & summary

> "Virtually all evolved processes that require coordination between actions rely at some level on stigmergy, in the sense that subsequent actions are stimulated by the trace left by previous actions in some observable and manipulable medium. The trace functions like a registry and map, indicating which actions have been performed and which still need to be performed. It is shared by all agents that have access to the medium, thus allowing them to coordinate their actions without need for agent-to-agent communication. It also allows individual agents to perform complex sequences of actions without need for a memory or plan that keeps track of which action needs to be performed when...
>
> Stigmergy can be seen as a fundamental mechanism of self-organization: it allows global, coordinated activity to emerge out of local, independent actions. Like self-organization in general, stigmergy relies on feedback: action elicits action, via the intermediary of the trace. This feedback is typically positive, in that actions intensify and elaborate the trace, thus eliciting more intense and diverse further actions. The resulting virtuous cycle explains in part why stigmergic organization is so surprisingly effective, enabling the construction of complex structures—such as a termite hill, a network of trails, or a world encyclopedia—in a very short time, even when starting from scratch. When necessary, feedback can also be negative: errors, disturbances or “overshoots” that make the trace deviate from its ideal shape will elicit actions that correct the deviation.
>
> We have examined different variations on this theme by distinguishing basic aspects or dimensions in which the process can vary. The number of agents involved turns out to be less fundamental than is generally assumed. Increasing that number will qualitatively enhance the result only if the agents are sufficiently diverse in the actions they contribute, yet sufficiently aligned in their strategies so that they do not hinder each other. Like the number of agents, the difference between qualitative and quantitative stigmergy does not seem essential, given that the notion of “stimulation” entails a quantitative aspect of intensity or probability, while the actions that are stimulated more or less intensively differ qualitatively. The difference between sematectonic traces—the concrete, observable results of work performed—and markers—traces left to guide subsequent actions, but without contributing to the work itself—is important but subtle. The use of markers allows a more fine-grained control of stigmergic coordination, but demands an advanced level of collective evolution, in which certain traces have acquired a conventional meaning among the agents that use them. The transience of the trace is crucial in order to ensure that the list of “to do’s” remains up to date: in a quickly changing environment, actions need to adapt in time to new circumstances, which means that an outdated trace should decay before it would elicit too much useless activity; in a more stable environment, on the other hand, persistent traces enable the accumulation of a long and detailed memory. A final dimension of variation, the broadcast-narrowcast continuum, is as yet insufficiently investigated. Nevertheless, it hints at an essential continuity between stigmergic mechanisms of self-organization (using a typically broadcasted trace) and the better-known, local interaction mechanisms, where the result of an action only affects linked or neighboring agents." - [Stigmergy as a Universal Coordination Mechanism: components, varieties and applications, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Stigmergy-Springer.pdf)

the shift from agents influencing the medium (bootstrapping) to the medium influencing the agents and becoming a mediator

> "After a while, the network of trails will have stabilized so that individual animals only need to contribute a minimal effort to its maintenance. Thus, the influence of individual agents on the medium tends to decrease. On the other hand, as the network becomes more reliable and extensive, the influence of the medium on the agents’ activities increases. Eventually, the asymmetry is inverted: where initially we would see the agents as manipulating the medium, now it becomes more parsimonious to see the medium as directing the agents. The medium has turned into a mediator: it coordinates the individual activities so as to minimize friction or conflict, and to maximize synergy. The classic example of such an “active” coordination medium can be found in the pheromone trails that ants create while searching for food. The trail network functions like an external memory or “collective mental map” for the ant colony, directing the individual ants to the different food sources and the nest via the most efficient routes." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

accelerating evolution

> "A major effect of stigmergy is the acceleration of evolution: a solution to an evolutionary problem found by one agent can now, by impressing it upon the medium, be used and improved by other agents. Since the medium benefits all agents’ fitness, there will be a selective pressure on the agents to find solutions that make the medium itself more powerful. The further the medium extends, and the easier it becomes for agents to interact with it, the quicker innovations will spread and undergo further improvements. This leads to a self-reinforcing process: improvement of the medium facilitates further innovation, which in turn helps improve the medium." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

# Collective Mental Map (CMM)

> "**A collective mental map (CMM) is defined as an external memory with shared read/write access, that represents problem states, actions and preferences for actions. It can be formalized as a weighted, directed graph.** The creation of a network of pheromone trails by ant colonies points us to some basic mechanisms of CMM development: averaging of individual preferences, amplification of weak links by positive feedback, and integration of specialised sub-networks through division of labor.
>
> ... **To generalize this definition of a problem for a collective consisting of several agents it suffices to aggregate the desires of the different agents into a collective preference and their perceptions of the present situation into a collective perception.**
>
> ... The need for a universally and dynamically shared memory has been well understood by researchers in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. Discussions over a CSCW system will typically keep a complete trace of everything that has been said, which can be consulted by all participants, and to which all participants can at any moment add personal annotations. This collective register of activities is often called a shared “blackboard”, “white board” or “workspace”. However, a record of all communications does not yet constitute a mental map. The more people participate in a discussion and the longer it lasts, the more the record will grow, and the more difficult it will become to distil any useful guidelines for action out of it...
>
> **A mental map is not merely a registry of events or an edited collection of notes, it is a highly selective representation of features relevant to problem-solving.**" - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

voting, individual preference functions (splitting voting power between alternatives) and their aggregation, the law of large numbers, diminishing returns

> "Probably the most basic method for reaching collective decisions and avoiding conflicts is voting... In a more sophisticated version of the voting mechanism, individuals can distribute their voting power over different alternatives, in proportion to their individual preference functions... In that case, **the collective preference function P(collective) becomes simply an average of the n individual preference functions.**
>
> ... Because of the law of large numbers, we can expect these “fluctuations” to cancel each other out when many different preferences are averaged. This will only leave what the different routes have in common, namely their bias towards the optimal solution. It seems that a similar mechanism may apply to human decision-making, under the same condition that there is no systematic bias away from the optimum. Therefore, **we may expect the average of the choices made by a large group to be effectively better than the choice made by a random individual**... As could be expected from the law of large numbers, the averaging mechanism provides decreasing returns: the improvement produced by adding a fixed number of individuals to the collective will become smaller as the size of the collective increases." - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

taming positive feedback - deviating from the collective preference with a non-zero probability so that the first options don't always entrench themselves and hinder the discovery of a global optimum

> "**The danger with positive feedback is that it can become too strong, so that a few reasonably good courses of action immediately attract all the activity, preventing the exploration of avenues that might produce even better solutions.** This risk can be controlled by **adjusting the individuals’ sensitivity to the collective preference... In order to guarantee a more or less exhaustive covering of the surroundings**, ants should **deviate from the strongest trail with a non-zero probability.** Increasing this probability will lead to more thorough exploration, but reduced efficiency of food gathering." - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

averaging opinions, collaborative filtering, clustering preferences by similarity

> "When there are thousands or millions of options, like in the Web, it becomes practically impossible for an individual to locate reliable experts that can give advice about each of the options. By shifting from an individual to a collective mode of recommendation, the problem becomes more manageable. **Instead of asking opinions to each individual, you might try to determine an “average opinion” for the group**, like in the voting and collective maze exploration examples we discussed before. This, however, ignores your particular interests, which may be different from those of the “average person”. **You would rather like to hear the opinions of those people who have interests similar to your own**, that is to say, you would prefer a “division-of-labor” type of organization, where people only contribute to the domain they are specialized in.
>
> **The basic mechanism behind collaborative filtering systems is the following: 1) a large group of people’s preferences are registered; 2) using a similarity metric, a subgroup of people is selected whose preferences are similar to the preferences of the person who seeks advice; 3) a (possibly weighted) average of the preferences for that subgroup is calculated; 4) the resulting preference function is used to recommend options** on which the advice-seeker has expressed no personal opinion as yet. Typical similarity metrics are Pearson correlation coefficients between the users’ preference functions and (less frequently) vector distances or dot products." - [Collective Intelligence and its Implementation on the Web: algorithms to develop a collective mental map, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/CollectiveWebIntelligence.pdf)

We can have complete control over how the similarity is determined (could also be about different sources of authority and trust) and we could easily compare the results of different filtering criteria, looking at the differences, exploring which groups of people tend to use what kinds of filters, etc. There are no limits to the number of perspectives we could take besides the computational cost required to generate them.

> "Self-organization establishes a relation between the behavior of the individual components and the structure and functionality of the system as a whole: simple interactions at the local level give rise to complex patterns at the global level. This phenomenon is called emergence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Coordination can then be defined as: the structuring of actions in time and (social) space so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy between these actions. Coordination can be subdivided in four elementary processes or mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow, and aggregation." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Alignment is the simplest form of coordination. It means that the different actions (and therefore also their agents) “point in the same direction”, or, more precisely, aim at the same target." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Friction does not in general imply conflict between the agents, though. Perhaps the two individuals really want to reach the same overall goal, such as getting the obstacle off the road. However, because their actions are not coordinated, they effectively oppose each other. To minimize friction, they should somehow come to push in the same direction, i.e. align their actions." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This example illustrates the mechanism of self-organization at the most elementary level. An action that is not succesful will normally be varied (variation). On the other hand, an action that is successful will be maintained or reinforced (selective retention or multiplication). Successful actions are characterized by minimal friction and maximal synergy. Therefore, the evolutionary mechanism of the blind-variation-and-natural-selection of actions will sooner or later produce an interaction that is more synergetic and less frictional. This mechanism does not require any planning, knowledge, or intelligence on the part of the agents. The only assumption is that the agents obey a logic of trial-and-error or variation-and-selection, producing a variety of actions until they find one that is maximally productive and stick to that one, irrespective of what causes that increase in productivity. Therefore, self-organization is a process that occurs at all levels, from atoms to societies. Note that this mechanism synthesizes the principles of self-organization originally formulated by the founding fathers of the domain. Ashby conceived self-organization as the automatic “selection” of stable states (attractors) by a dynamic system. Von Foerster and Prigogine added that such attractors will be reached more quickly by injecting “random” or blind variation into the system, a principle they called “order from noise”, “order through fluctuations”, or “order out of chaos”." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Assume that agents prefer to do the tasks they are most skilled at, because those are the ones that will cost them least effort. In that case, it suffices for the different tasks to be laid out in such a way that all available agents can examine them. As soon as an agent recognizes a task that it is particularly skilled at, it will pick up that task, leaving less fitting tasks for the others. Thus, the number of remaining tasks will gradually diminish. There is of course the risk that the remaining tasks fit none of the remaining agents, but we can make the assumption that all agents are flexible to some degree and can if necessary do a task they are not particularly skilled at, albeit less efficiently. In this way, the different tasks will get performed in an overall rather efficient way, although the arrangement may not be optimal. (Such less-than-optimal, but more-thanacceptable performance is what we normally find in the real world, as opposed to the idealized world of mathematical models, where things tend to work either perfectly, or not at all…).
>
> One example of such self-organizing division of labor is Wikipedia, the Internet encyclopedia that is being written collaboratively by millions of people worldwide. No “editorin-chief” has divided the labor among the contributors, by specifying which expert should write a page on which subject, as is done in traditional encyclopedias. Instead, the “experts” have selfselected by starting to write, adding to, or correcting any page for which they felt they had sufficient competence to make a contribution. Thus, a football supporter may add something about the scoring percentages of his favorite team, while a butterfly collector may contribute something about the color patterns of her favorite species...
>
> With some minor variations, the same process happens in a market economy: different businesses spread out and specialize so as to maximally fill each of the available niches, i.e. delivering the specific products and services for which there is sufficient demand, and for which their competence in delivering it is at least as good as the one of their competitors. This form of self-organizing allocation of agents (firms) to tasks (supplying goods and services) is sometimes referred to as the “invisible hand” of the market. While in practice the solution will never be optimal, it has proven to be far superior to the alternative of a centralized economic planning, as practiced e.g. in the Soviet Union. The reason is that the “calculation problem” of establishing exactly how many goods of which type need to be delivered by whom is much too complex to be solved by any planner. Only self-organization can produce robust solutions to problems of such complexity and variability." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "As long as a large enough number of agents with sufficiently diverse or broad skills is available, such a self-organizing solution to the problem of workflow can be quite efficient. There is no need to plan when a particular agent should execute a particular task, as long as enough agents are available so that a sufficiently skilled one is ready to take over soon after the previous task is finished." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "While division of labor is a branching process, where an activity is split up into smaller, independently executed tasks, aggregation goes the other way, letting the branches converge again into a single result. Division of labor, workflow and aggregation can be seen as the three fundamental aspects or dimensions of a complex, branching network of mutually dependent processes.
>
> Aggregation too allows for self-organizing approaches. The simplest one is when the different actions superimpose their results on a shared substrate or medium. For example, the work done by the different builders and technicians on a house accumulates in the physical building itself. There is no need to assemble the plumbing with the electrical circuitry as both have been installed on the same walls. But aggregation via a shared medium can also apply to more abstract, informational activities. Again, Wikipedia provides an excellent example: the different contributions to this encyclopedia of global knowledge are aggregated automatically because they are added to the same website. Without this shared electronic medium, assembling the millions of contributions into a coherent whole would have been a task of gigantic proportions...
>
> A different form of self-organizing aggregation occurs when the products of the different activities can interact and develop links or “bonds”, where the one fits in with the other. The examples we discussed before of the spontaneous division of labor in ecosystems or market economies are also examples of spontaneous integration. Businesses or species not only differentiate from other businesses or species in order to better occupy as yet unclaimed niches, they also connect themselves to other businesses or species as providers of resources or services that they need for their own functioning. Thus, a typical business will be a tightly linked hub in a network of suppliers, clients, employees, regulators, and other stakeholders that all depend on each other. Together, they form an integrated socioeconomic system that performs a coherent set of functions for society. The mechanism behind this is again variation and selection: agents interact with many other agents. If the interaction is succesful, they will tend to maintain it (selective retention), thus creating a stable bond of mutual dependency. Otherwise, the interaction will be stopped (elimination) and replaced by another one." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Collective intelligence assumes that different agents have different forms of expertise (knowledge, information, skills). Otherwise,they would not be able to do more together than individually. Achieving collective intelligencetherefore is a problem of cognitive coordination between the different agents. This can again besplit up into the four basic mechanisms of alignment, division of labor, workflow andaggregation.
>
> Alignment means that the agents should point at the same targets, so that they do notwork at cross-purposes. This implies that agents should agree at least about what the problem isthat is to be solved, and about what the different tools or methods are they may need to tackle itcollaboratively. However, alignment here does not mean that the agents should perform thesame actions, because in that case there is no collective intelligence. Adding identical effortstogether, like when a number of agents push a heavy weight in the same direction, only makessense when performing physical tasks, not when processing information. Indeed, when you adda piece of information (e.g. X=3) to the same piece of information (X=3), you still only have asingle piece of information. Therefore, a division of labor, in the sense of different agentscontributing different information, is essential. Depending on the complexity of the problem,workflow may or may not be needed. Some problems can be solved in a single step, all agentssimultaneously contributing their expertise. Others need several iterations, the one buildingfurther on the previous one. But the final step of aggregating all the contributions remainsessential in order to come to a coherent answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "[Surowiecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Surowiecki) proposes the following list of requirements that a group must fulfil to exhibit collective intelligence (or wisdom of crowds, as he calls it):
>
> • Diversity: the more diverse the knowledge and experience possessed by the different members of the group, the more the group as whole knows and the less its members are likely to overlook certain aspects, or to fall prey to the same bias.
>
> • Independence: individuals should express their contribution as much as possible independently from other members of the group; otherwise, when the opinion of the oneis influenced by the opinion of the other, there is a risk of premature alignment, i.e.between the contributions themselves rather than between the targets of thecontributions.
>
> • Decentralization: this Surowiecky’s term for what we have called “division of labor”: people should as much as possible be able to gather and process their information in parallel, so that they can together cover an as wide range of aspects as possible.
>
> • Aggregation: collective intelligence requires an effective mechanism, such as voting, averaging or discussion, for synthesizing a diversity of individual opinions into a single,collective answer." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The most important issue in such collective processes is to avoid what Janis has called “groupthink”. This is the phenomenon where people in a group all start to think the same, because a slight initial preference for one approach rather than another becomes amplified via positive feedback. The underlying dynamic is that if someone hears an opinion expressed by someone else, s/he will be more inclined to express a similar opinion. This happens partly because hearing a certain approach will “prime” the mind to consider things from the same perspective, partly because people tend to be conformist, and do not like to contradict or appear to be in conflict with others. The more often similar opinions have been expressed, the less likely group members are to express dissimilar opinions—partly out of conformism, partly because the more they hear a particular position defended, the more they will get convinced that this is the right one, and the less they will be inclined to think of alternatives. In that way, they may all quickly converge to the same opinion, without giving potentially better alternatives the chance to be duly considered.
>
> A more extreme version of this process leads to the phenomenon of group polarization (also known as “risky shift”). This refers to the common observation that groups tend to be more extreme in their judgments after a discussion than the members were individually before the discussion. “More extreme” here means deviating more from the middle ground. For example, if jury members are individually inclined to judge a crime relatively harshly (e.g. proposing a 15-year prison sentence on average), after the debates they will tend to judge it even more harshly (e.g. deciding on a 25-year prison term). If a different group is asked to judge the same crime, but the members are individually inclined to be more lenient (e.g. proposing a 10-year sentence on average), as a group they are likely to come to an even more lenient judgment (e.g. a 5-year sentence). Polarization can be explained by the positive feedback underlying alignment, which amplifies deviations: the more people hear arguments for a “risky” position, the more they will think themselves of additional arguments for that position, and the more confident they will become in moving further away from the “safe” middle ground.
>
> Groupthink is an example of self-organization gone wrong, where non-linear interaction has led to premature alignment on a suboptimal solution, and where the positive contributions of diversity and division of labor have been neglected." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The simplest way to avoid groupthink is to disallow direct communication between the group members, so that the one cannot influence the other one until everyone has been able make a full contribution. However, a collective solution still requires an aggregation mechanism that integrates these different contributions.
>
> This is perhaps easiest to achieve when the looked for solution can be expressed as a number. In that case, everyone can independently make an estimate of the correct number, e.g. by writing it onto a piece of paper. The pieces are then collected, and the final solution is aggregated by calculating the average of the numbers. In many cases, this produces remarkably good results. For example, when at a fair people are asked to estimate the number of beans in a jar, or the weight of a bull, the average of their guesses is typically much more accurate than even the best of the individual guesses. The reason is that each individual guess is biased by the limited experience of that individual, making the estimate either too low or too high. However, when many independent estimates are aggregated, these “errors” or deviations from the optimal solution tend to be “averaged out”, because of the law of large numbers. This phenomenon can be demonstrated through agent simulations even for more complex problem solutions, as long as the solution can be expressed as a  sequence of numbers that need to be averaged, and as long as the individual agents vary randomly in the errors they make.
>
> However, when different individuals tend to have the same bias (e.g. all overestimating the weight of the bull), their aggregate solution will exhibit that bias too, and the best individual estimate will be more accurate than the average for the group.
>
> The averaging method only works for quantitative decisions. Some of the most common methods, such as discussion in committee meetings, do not obey the criteria of independence and decentralization, and therefore may lead to poor results. The result can be improved if the different members express their opinions independently and anonymously (e.g. on a computersupported discussion system) before they start responding to the opinions of others, and if the discussion is guided by a neutral moderator, who ensures that everybody duly answers all the important questions, and responds to criticisms of their previous answers. The anonymity makes sure that everybody’s ideas are given equal attention (instead of the discussion being dominated by the more authoritative people). This is the basis of the so-called Delphi method that aggregates the ideas of a panel of experts, via several rounds of anonymous, mediated discussion." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "To shift from individual intelligence to collective intelligence, we need to make intentionality collective as well. Words and other symbols can only be used for effective communication if the conversation partners understand them in the same way, that is if they agree about wat the word refers to. Developing such shared references is a problem of what we have called alignment. We have defined alignment as the unification or merging of the targets of different actions or agents. As long as there is no “director” agent to impose a target on the others, this problem can only be solved through self-organization, that is, spontaneous, reciprocal adaptation of the agents’ targets." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "This is the same mechanism of alignment that underlies all self-organization: by reducing the friction that is otherwise caused by the need to recognize and interpret a novel form and because of the high probability of confusion that arises if the conversation partners use different forms, alignment on the same forms makes communication more efficient. As shown by many experiments and observations, one-to-one alignment is a very quick and automatic process that makes conversation much easier than it would be if the partners would have to explicitly agree about how they refer to the different items in their shared context Conversational alignment will not only produce shared references; it will moreover tend to make those references simpler and more efficient." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Establishing a shared system of reference (alignment) is only the first step in collaboratively solving a problem. Moreover, alignment can go too far, in the sense that unusual, but valuable, approaches are suppressed because of the tendency of the largest subgroup to impose its “targets” on the rest of the group. When alignment merely concerns the establishment of lexical conventions or agreed-upon labels, then in essence any label is as good as any other, and alignment is a priori positive. However, when the “targets” of thought and action are fundamentally different, excluding some targets because they represent minority positions will a priori reduce the potential for collective intelligence. Typical experiments in collective problemsolving either artificially impose maximal independence on the individuals (e.g. requiring them to write down their opinion anonymously) until the moment when their contributions are aggregated (e.g. by counting votes or averaging guesses), or allow free-ranging discussion with the intent to come to a consensual decision, thus running the risk of groupthink and a loss of collective intelligence." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "Typical conditions that have been proposed for the emergence of groupthink are direction by an authoritative leader, conformity pressure, and the need to come to a clear-cut consensus. All were absent in the experimental set-up. Since the issue they discussed had 20 different components, it was difficult to come to a clear conclusion. Perhaps most importantly, the participants filled in the survey individually after the discussion. Therefore, there was no pressure, neither explicitly nor implicitly, to “conform” to the opinions of the others, since no one knew exactly what those others had entered in their survey forms. Still, there was some convergence between opinions, but this seems to have been of the “healthy” kind, where participants learned things from each other that were missing from their own limited perspective." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The underlying dynamic of self-organization is local trial-and-error or variation-andselection, in which two interacting agents try to mutually adapt their actions, until they hit on a “coordinated” pattern that is acceptable to both, and thus is selectively retained. This local pattern is then typically propagated step-by-step to the neighboring agents and the neighbors’ neighbors. The spreading “wave” of coordination is thus amplified until it encompasses the global system, via a process of positive feedback.
>
> Coordination can be decomposed into four relatively independent mechanisms: alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation. Alignment is the simplest, as it merely requires the agents to “point in the same direction”, i.e. direct their actions at the same targets. This is necessary to avoid the friction that is otherwise caused by opposing actions. Alignment creates convergence or homogeneity between interacting agents. When the agents are distributed across space, the resulting homogeneity may be limited to a certain region, with boundaries between differently aligned regions emerging after self-organization. This can explain the appearance of separate cultures or languages, and the points of friction between them.
>
> Even when such remaining friction is avoided, alignment is not yet sufficient to reap the full benefits of synergy, in which the whole of the actions produces more than the sum of the effects produced by each action separately. Synergy requires complementarity, in which one action makes up for what the other one lacks, so that together they can achieve goals that they cannot achieve alone. Synergy is promoted by the other three coordination mechanism. Division of labor means that different agents perform different actions at the same time, so that each can contribute its unique expertise to the part of problem it is most skilled at. Workflow means that an action is followed by a subsequent action that fills in the gaps left by the previous one. Aggregation, finally, ensures that all these different contributions are assembled into a coherent outcome." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

> "The first issue here is the emergence of collective intentionality: how do groups align the targets of their communications and actions? In the domain of language, this problem has been investigated by means of a variety of software simulations and experiments with groups or pairs of conversing individuals. The basic mechanism is that each time an agent targets a particular referent or communicative structure in its interaction with another agent, this primes (weakly prepares) the second agent to target a similar referent, making a shift towards a common referent slightly easier. Many such small, individual shifts eventually snowball into the emergence of a reference shared by the whole group. This research confirms and illustrates the general mechanism of self-organizing alignment, while clarifying the origin of linguistic conventions.
>
> A second issue is the emergence of collective intelligence: in how far do people manage to solve problems better as a group than individually? Most research in this domain has focused on the problems of groupthink and polarization, a form of premature alignment in which valuable contributions are suppressed because of a tendency of groups to conform to and reinforce any emerging consensus. This results in phenomena of “collective stupidity” or “madness of crowds”, rather than “collective intelligence” or “wisdom of crowds”. The general  recommendation therefore has been to minimize the (non-linear) interactions between individuals that promote alignment, and to use some neutral mechanism such as averaging to directly aggregate the individual contributions. While this strategy is undoubtedly useful in a number of cases, it risks to throw the baby out with the bathwater, as it makes self-organizing division of labor and especially workflow more difficult." - [Self-organization in Communicating Groups: the emergence of coordination, shared references and collective intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Barcelona-LanguageSO.pdf)

the self as a construction of an adaptive, actionable, embodied story that holds components together and enables intelligent navigation of a problem space

> "It seems crazy to think that an agent, even a minimal kind, can be just a metastable pattern in an excitable medium—a temporarily persistent pattern. But that is what we are too—temporarily persistent, autocatalytic, dissipative patterns that self-reify our boundaries from the outside world via active inference and interpreting our environment to tell coherent stories (models) that hold us together and make us more than the sum of our parts.
>
> ... Could consciousness simply be what it feels like to be in charge of constant self-construction, driven to reinterpret all available data in the service of choosing what to do next? In this sense, cognition is essentially freedom from the past; cognitive Selves could be systems that are not committed to their own past and their own memories. Paradoxically, biological Selves do not take themselves too seriously in the sense that they are not committed to a fixed set of meanings established by their prior Selflets—their freedom consists not only in actions, but in forward-looking sense-making of their own mental content. Letting go of the past Self and living life forward is a commitment to making the best of internal, not only external, information. This is in broad agreement with Solms’s idea that consciousness is palpated uncertainty about the outside world; I propose to expand this idea, with the hypothesis that consciousness is palpated uncertainty about your own memories and internal states.

> ... Normal bodies consist of networks of cells working together toward a unified goal - create and maintain specific large structures. In an important sense, each cell is integrated, via physiological signaling, into a coherent swarm intelligence with system-level (anatomical) goals. In cancer, the scope of the coherent Self of a cell reduces from being as large as the boundary of a whole body, to that of just one cell’s surface. The scope of the Self – the structure which a cell works to maintain and support – shrinks drastically... The boundary between self and non-self can shift: multicellularity enlarges it, while carcinogenesis reduces it, and it is readily seen how this shifts the behavior of cells toward a mode that is not beneficial for the organism level... Being electrically isolated from their neighbors by a shutdown of gap junction synapses, a cell can neither measure distant events nor communicate across anatomical distances with other cells and with the outside world. All of the attention (in terms of measurement and activity toward scaled goals) is focused at the single cell level, while the rest of the body is treated as the “external environment” (and all living things exploit their environment for their own benefit)... The time horizon of activity shifts from decades (somatic cells execute regenerative and repair processes that maintain a body up to ~100 years) to a much shorter time frame, as cancer cells undertake activity which may kill the host (and themselves) within a mere year. Normal cells pursue goals (organ maintenance) that can be much longer than a cell’s individual lifespan, especially in tissues with rapid cellular turnover – the time scale for such homeostatic activity is one that belongs to the collective, not the cells themselves.

> ... The cells in a metazoan organism body are not less selfish than unicellular organisms or cancer cells. They are equally selfish, working only for the benefit of themselves, but the relevant self that they defend is bigger in terms of space, time, and complexity.

> ... The initial, most primitive feature of a living system is preferences – the fact that some states of the world are better for its welfare than others. This enables learning from positive and negative reinforcement, which leads to an explosion of computational and behavioral capabilities. Preferences evolve into goals to the extent that a system grows in complexity and causal power and becomes able to act in the world in ways that are likely to move it toward preferred regions of its state space (initially, focused on simple metabolic survival, but ranging all the way to complex human psychological needs and perhaps **beyond**).
>
> ... **The cognitive boundary of an Individual [a “Center of Concern”] is the most distant (in time and space) set of events that this system can measure and attempts to regulate in its goal-directed activity**... It is unlikely that today’s human cognitive sphere is the maximum possible one.
>
> ... The new Individual is an integrated whole because its subunits no longer exclusively have their own local, distinct microenvironments (and thus internal models of the world) but are constrained to share a bigger, common reality due to the spread of information and influence among them. Such collective individuals can have a higher problem-solving capacity than their members, because they can support a layered architecture with experience-dependent communication channels (synapses, broadly defined), emergence of “virtual governors” with beneficial properties with respect to control capacity, and more complex state space with more attractors and thus can compute meta-system properties not accessible to the single agents... It is thus no coincidence that most anesthetics used to remove cognition and sensory experience, whether in plants or animals, are gap junctional (bioelectric) uncouplers.
>
> ... To move the whole animal, not just individual cells, the electrical information needs to be scaled considerably, and nervous systems are an ideal extension of ancient, pre-neural bioelectric signaling paths to enable further scaling of the cognitive boundary of cells into organs, organisms, swarms, and societies.
>
> ... **The hypothesis of scale-free cognition does not rely on cooperation per se – it builds up apparent cooperation from selfish agents minimizing their stress (surprise) and competing for information. Greed, at the single-cell level, for information (infotaxis) drives cooperativity, as each unit expands its measurement boundary (communication with neighbors) and thus inevitably becomes part of a bigger self with bigger set points serving as homeostatic attractors. It only looks like cooperation from a perspective of a higher level, because the higher level of organization shows an integrated Self which appears, necessarily, cooperative**... There is a deep functional scale-invariance between the decision-making of cells in building body structures, the workings of an insect colony, and the integrated behavior of a human “Person”: these are the cybernetic processes of learning and parameter optimization implemented by large numbers of units pursuing infotaxis and homeostatic goals at whatever scale the sensory channels permit." - [The Computational Boundary of a “Self”: Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition, by Michael Levin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688/full)

> "What I do think is that our future development involves not losing our love for our children, but our expansion of that love for others. I don’t believe it’s a zero sum game and I don’t believe that loving others will devalue our love for our own kids; sure, our cognitive apparatus is limited, but I think the future involves expanding it so that we can love more others. **I think a mature species has a wider cone of compassion that over-rides in-group/out-group dynamics of evolution and allows us to love each other more. Do you really think that would be bad?** Let’s start small. Suppose we found that some neurodivergent people loved their kids as much as you and I do, but turns out they also love their nieces and nephews the same. Is that a problem? I don’t see it as a problem. **In a future world where we hopefully won’t always have to solve trolley problems like “do I let my kids, or someone else’s kids survive?”, why is it bad to expand the ability to love others who are not genetically related? We already know how to do this – with spouses and adoptees. I agree with you that if we were to do this at the *expense* of loving our kids as we do now, that’s a no-go. We can’t substitute that for some sort of washed out lip service where “everyone is great” but we don’t really care about anyone including our kids. I am conjecturing that this is not the only way forward for us;** I believe (but of course cannot prove) that **if we make it to maturity as a civilization, we will not have a zero sum game for love and we will not decrease our love for our kids, we will not dilute it.

TODO fix these "notes"

Its not about selfishness or being vs. not being selfish - its about how big the self is. We need to reframe cancer from "how to kill the cancerous cells" to "how to re-connect them to the bigger whole" - both biologically and socially.

Sublimation of the individual self into a higher entity

We are nothing without everyone else

Family shares a root with familiarity.
We have to be familiar with someone to consider them family - enlarging the boundary of the self

## On self models, resource allocation and the cognitive light cone in space and time

> "From an active-inference perspective, the human experienced-self model is a component of the overall generative model employed to predict the consequences of actions, particularly actions in a social context. Dysfunctions in the model, particularly dysfunctional assignments of precision or relative importance to particular environmental inputs or prior beliefs, result in contextually-dysfunctional actions in predictable ways. **This suggests generalizing the notion of a "self-model" to any metacognitive component of an overall generative model that modulates precision assignments and hence effectively allocates attention and other cognitive resources, including memory, to some aspects of an action context at the expense of others.** Such metacognitive components can be expected in any system that experiences selective pressures with different characteristic timescales. **Properties of a context that a system assigns high precision to can be considered properties that the system cares about. Positioning these items of concern, which may include the system’s own past and future selves, in space and time relative to the system’s space-time location generates the system’s "cognitive light cone" (CLC), a representation of the maximal extent in space and time of its concerns;** crucially, the CLC is not depicting the maximal reach of sensors or effectors, but rather the maximum size of states that the agent is capable of working towards as goals. **As what is in the CLC is what can in­fluence the system’s metacognitive control of attention, we can view the CLC as a generalization of the experienced self-model that can be applied to any system, and in particular, to any organism.**
>
> **Reconceptualizing the self-model as the CLC emphasizes its functional role as a resource-allocation tool. The CLC serves, in particular, as a context for event memories and a focus for planning. Both the spatial and temporal extents of the CLC are heavily dependent on both memory and computational processing resources**, i.e. on the degrees of freedom available to implement the system’s internal interaction and the size of its boundary. The CLCs of unicells and small multicellulars, e.g. the tick in Fig. 5, may be limited to the immediate vicinity of its physiological boundary and one or a few of its internally-counted time steps. **The CLCs of humans, in contrast, can employ imagination as a resource to extend their active goals into interstellar space, and both backwards and forwards in time far beyond an individual’s lifespan. Human CLCs, at least, can expand or contract depending on an individual’s current state, resources, and ambitions;** e.g. an infant might have a narrow cone focused on immediate survival, a child may care about friends or look forward to "what they want to be when they grow up", and a mature adult may have a broader cone encompassing concerns about the state of the world and the well-being of others even far into the future. **Collectives of cells – e.g. of human cells – can clearly have CLCs much larger than those of individual cells**, which represent anatomical states as target morphologies toward which they actively work in regulative development and regeneration. **Collectives of some social organisms – e.g. ants -appear to have CLCs larger than those of their individual members. Whether collectives of humans have CLCs larger than those of individual humans remains an open question.**
>
> As with the experienced self-model as implemented by the default-mode network, **the operational size of the CLC can be expanded or contracted in a task- or context-dependent way. Activities that require unwavering attentional focus on the immediate spatiotemporal environment – e.g. rock climbing or competitive driving – are incompatible with the re-examination of history or long-term planning.** The farther spatial and temporal extents of the CLC can, moreover, be expected to be coarse-grained relative to the more proximal components. This coarse-graining r­eflects the fact that the CLC is, like the human experienced self-model, a construct that must be computed, in real time, from information available at some particular time and in some particular context. **Hence the temporal depth of the CLC in both directions is critically dependent on the system’s ability to track its own identity through imagined, or projected time, i.e. on its "mental time travel" ability. It is also dependent, in any realistic, resource-limited setting, on the system’s ability to forget unnecessary details of its past and make explicit only those elements of a plan that are assigned the greatest relevance.** It is dependent, therefore, on the system implementing a heuristic solution to the Frame Problem, the problem of deciding what remains unchanged following an action.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva_vow

The Bodhisattva vow is a vow taken by some Mahāyāna Buddhists to achieve full buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings. One who has taken the vow is nominally known as a bodhisattva (a being working towards buddhahood). This can be done by venerating all Buddhas and by cultivating supreme moral and spiritual perfection, to be placed in the service of others. In particular, bodhisattvas promise to practice the six perfections of giving, moral discipline, patience, effort, concentration and wisdom in order to fulfill their bodhicitta aim of attaining buddhahood for the sake of all beings.

## Binding agents through stress sharing & memory towards the same homeostatic goals in a coherent higher/expanded Self

> "The plasticity of biological bodies, made of cells that die, are born, and significantly rearrange their tissue architecture, suggests that **the understanding of cognition is fundamentally a problem of collective intelligence**: to understand how stable cognitive structures can persist and map onto swarm dynamics, with preferences and stressors that scale from those of their components.
>
> ... The whole process of evolution, basically a hill-climbing search algorithm, results in a set of frozen accidents and meandering selection among random tweaks to the micro-level hardware of cells, with impossible to predict large-scale consequences for the emergent system level structure and function. **If this short-sighted process, constrained by many forces that have nothing to do with favoring complex cognition, can give rise to true minds, then so can a rational engineering approach.**
>
> ... The TAME (Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere) framework takes the following as **the basic hallmarks of being a Self: the ability to pursue goals, to own compound (e.g., associative) memories, and to serve as the locus for credit assignment (be rewarded or punished), where all of these are at a scale larger than possible for any of its components alone.**
>
> ... The scope of states that an agent can possibly be stressed by, in effect, defines their degree of cognitive capacity. **Stress is a systemic response to a difference between current state and a desired setpoint; it is an essential component to scaling of Selves because it enables different modules (which sense and act on things at different scales and in distributed locations) to be bound together in one global homeostatic loop (toward a larger purpose).**
>
> ... **Systemic stress occurs when one sub-agent is not satisfied about its local conditions, and propagates its unhappiness outward as hard-to-ignore signals. In this process, stress pathways serve the same function as hidden layers in a network, enabling the system to be more adaptive by connecting diverse modular inputs and outputs to the same basic stress minimization loop.** Such networks scale stress, but stress is also what helps the network scale up its agency—a bidirectional positive feedback loop... **Stress causes other agents to work toward the same goal, serving as an influence that binds subunits across space into a coherent higher Self and resists the “struggle of the parts”.**
>
> ... The degree of intelligence, or sophistication, of an agent in any space is roughly proportional to its ability to deploy memory and prediction (information processing) in order to avoid local maxima.
>
> ... This property of gap junction coupling promotes the creation of a larger Self by partially erasing the mnemic boundaries between the parts which might impair their ability to work toward a common goal. **This is a key part of the scaling of the Self by enlarging toward common goals—not by micromanagement, but by bringing multiple subunits into the same goal-directed loop by tightly coupling the sensing, memory, and action steps in a syncytium where all activity is bound toward a system-level teleonomic process.**
>
> ... **Stress signals, propagating through such networks, incentivize other regions of the tissue to act cooperatively in response to distant events by harnessing their selfish drive to reduce their own stress. This facilitates the coherent, system-level response to perturbations beyond their local consequences**, and gives rise to larger Selves able to react coherently to stressful departures from more complex, spatially-distributed allostatic setpoints... Evolution tackles this task by exploiting a **multiscale competency architecture (MCA), where subunits making up each level of organization are themselves homeostatic agents. It’s built on an extremely powerful design principle: error correction.**
>
> ... Every intelligence is a collective intelligence, and **the modular, multi-scale architecture of life means that we are a holobiont in more than just the sense of having a microbiome — we are all patchworks of overlapping, nested, competing, and cooperating agents that have homeostatic (goal-directed) activity within their self-constructed virtual space at a scale that determines their cognitive sophistication.**
>
> ... **Given the ability of human subunits to merge into even larger (social) structures, how do we construct higher-order Selves that promote flourishing for all?** The multicellularity-cancer dynamic suggests that tight functional connections that blur cognitive boundaries among subunits is a way to increase cooperation and cognitive capacity. However, simply maximizing loss of identity into massive collectivism is a well-known failure at the social level, always resulting in the same dynamic: the goals of the whole diverge sharply from those of the parts, which become as disposable to the larger social Self as shed skin cells are to us. Thus, **the goal of this research program beyond biology is the search for optimal binding policies between subunits, which optimize the tradeoffs needed to maximize individual goals and well-being (preserving freedom or empowerment) while reaping the benefits of a scaled-up Self at the level of groups and entire societies.** While the specific binding mechanisms used by evolution are not guaranteed to be the policies we want at the social level, the study of these are critical for jump-starting a rigorous program of research into possible ways of scaling that could have social relevance." - [Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere: An Experimentally-Grounded Framework for Understanding Diverse Bodies and Minds, by Michael Levin](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2022.768201/full)

> "**The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress—the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system’s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness).** Defined in this way, “stress” turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term duḥkha (otherwise often rendered as “suffering”), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. **In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so duḥkha is a continuous state that compels beings to act. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of “make and maintain a whole limb” of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives.** It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings.
>
> ... Stress drives agents towards homeostatic goals—a concept central to Buddhism with its teaching of existence as dissatisfaction, duḥkha. **Expanding one’s space of possible goals to face outwards, exhibiting compassion toward other agents’ goals, potentiates the increase of intelligence and thus the potential to identify better, more global solutions. In this scheme, compassion (in the sense of practical concern) and intelligence are tightly linked because the driving definition of an active agent is the bundle of processes that expend energy toward system-level goals. The scale and content of what a given agent measures, prefers, and seeks to implement define its cognitive sophistication.**" - [Biology, Buddhism, and AI: Care as the Driver of Intelligence, by Michael Levin & others](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/710)

> "How does society work? Five words or less: Behavior is determined by incentives... The particular arrangement of incentives across time, space, and causality is called an incentive structure.
>
> ... What about free will? It’s the ability to respond to our incentives. Being a good person? It’s having an incentive to behave in ways we call “good”—that is, wanting to win the virtue game... Let’s give this worldview a name. Let’s call it incentive determinism. Incentive determinism is obvious. It’s just a bunch of tautologies: we are who we are, we want what we want, and we do what we’re caused to do. And yet, barely anybody thinks this way. It’s a cold, alien way of thinking... We spend very little time discussing which incentive structures are the best, and tons of time talking about which sets of words are the right words and which sets of people are the right people. It’s why we write words at all: we think we’re the right people with the right words, and if we just say those words loudly enough, we’ll improve the world.
>
> ... People don’t like incentive determinism because it’s disorienting. It tells us that our single greatest obsession, likability, is a distraction. It’s bullshit—a destroyer of insight, an enemy of understanding. It plays no special role in explaining how the world works. All it does is give us the illusion of understanding—the feeling of superiority to our apparently unlikable rivals (another big incentive for us)—while leaving us in ignorance of the causal structure of the world.
>
> And that causal structure is everything. If there are powerful incentives to help others, then even “evil” people will help others. If there are powerful incentives to hurt others, then even “good” people will hurt others. In fact, if being a “good” person just means being strongly incentivized by others’ moral approval (i.e., really wanting to win the virtue game), then good people are more likely to hurt people when it wins them moral approval. The “good” members of ISIS are the ones who bravely volunteer to commit suicide bombings, and the “bad” members of ISIS are the ones who cravenly fail to make the ultimate sacrifice. People are only as good as their incentives.
>
> But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe figuring out how this all works—understanding the machinery of society—can, itself, change our incentive structures. Insight is a thing in the world that human primates evolved to want, at least sometimes.
>
> If there’s any hope to be found in this cold, alien view of the world, it’s this: the more we all become aware of our incentive structures, the more incentivized we will be to choose them wisely... If we're collectively aware of our incentive structures, and aware that others know that we're aware, then we have an incentive to pick one that makes everyone better off, so that people won't judge us as selfish. So the key is achieving widespread awareness, or common knowledge, of our incentive structures... we're trying to explain the part of reality that is not random. That is all we can do. And when we look at that part, incentives are everything.
>
> ... I don't see incentive determinism as a "theory" so much as a different way of thinking, or a useful conceptual framework. It's honestly just a way of activating a different part of the brain--the tool-use part--to understand society as a machine of moving parts. It's more of a metatheory, really, or a useful way of coming up with other theories. It can give rise to more specific theories about the incentive structures we face, and how they work, which can then be tested.

> "Collective intelligence is the ability of a group to perform more effectively than any individual alone. Diversity among group members is a key condition for the emergence of collective intelligence, but maintaining diversity is challenging in the face of social pressure to imitate one’s peers. Through an evolutionary game-theoretic model of collective prediction, we investigate the role that incentives may play in maintaining useful diversity. We show that market-based incentive systems produce herding effects, reduce information available to the group, and restrain collective intelligence. Therefore, we propose an incentive scheme that rewards accurate minority predictions and show that this produces optimal diversity and collective predictive accuracy. We conclude that real world systems should reward those who have shown accuracy when the majority opinion has been in error.
>
> ... We proposed a reward system, minority rewards, that incentivizes individual agents in their choice of which informational factors to pay attention to when operating as part of a group. This system rewards agents for both making accurate predictions and being in the minority of their peers or conspecifics. As such, it encourages a balance between seeking useful information that has substantive predictive value for the ground truth and seeking information that is currently underutilized by the group. Conversely, where the collective opinion is already correct, no rewards are offered, and therefore, no agent is motivated to change their strategy. Over time, therefore, agents are motivated to change their behavior only in ways that benefit collective accuracy.
>
> The poor performance of market rewards relative to a uniform unweighted allocation for n > 10 shows that a market reward system incentivizes herding behavior and suppresses useful diversity as illustrated by the equilibrium distribution in Fig. 3B. This result suggests that stock markets and prediction markets tend to systematically underweight a large pool of informational factors that are of limited predictive power individually but that can contribute powerfully to aggregate predictions if agents can be persuaded to pay attention to them. This finding sheds doubt on the accuracy of existing markets as a tool for aggregating dispersed knowledge to predict future profits or events and motivates additional work on how to design collectively more accurate market mechanisms. The relatively high performance of uniform allocations of attention supports work showing that models with equally weighted predictors can match or even improve on more closely fitted prediction models. The inclusion of all relevant predictors is often more important than determining their appropriate weights in making predictions; too much diversity is less harmful than too little, especially for complex problems.
>
> Incentives are a fundamental part of any effort to harness the potential of collective intelligence. In this paper, we have presented evidence that rewarding accurate minority opinions can induce near-optimal collective accuracy within a model of collective prediction. Therefore, to maximize the collective wisdom of a group, we suggest that individuals should not be rewarded simply for having made successful predictions or findings and also that a total reward should not be equally distributed among those who have been successful or accurate. Instead, rewards should be primarily directed toward those who have made successful predictions in the face of majority opposition from their peers. This proposal can be intuitively understood as rewarding those who contribute information that has the potential to change collective opinion, because it contradicts the current mainstream view. In our model, groups rapidly converge to an equilibrium with very high collective accuracy, after which the rewards for each agents become less frequent. We anticipate that, after this occurs, agents would move on to new unsolved problems. This movement would produce a dynamic system in which agents are incentivized to not only solve problems collectively but also, address issues where collective wisdom is currently weakest. Future work should investigate how our proposed reward system can be best implemented in practice from scientific career schemes to funding and reputation systems (33) to prediction markets and democratic procedures (34). We suggest experiments to determine how humans respond to minority rewards and additional theoretical work to determine the effects of stochastic rewards, agent learning, and finite group dynamics. In conclusion, how best to foster collective intelligence is an important problem that we need to solve collectively." - [Optimal incentives for collective intelligence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1618722114)

## Mobilization Systems

> "A mobilization system can then be defined as: a socio-technological system that motivates and coordinates people to work towards a given objective—thus efficiently rallying their efforts... the underlying ICT techniques have been explored... under labels such as “persuasive technology”, “collaborative technology”, “user experience”, and “gamification”.
>
> ... **Games and gamification** ... What these communities have in common is that they collectively produce very useful—and typically high-quality—applications and information, but this without any financial compensation or legal organization. In other words, these communities consist purely of volunteers contributing on an informal basis to a common project. From the perspective of traditional economics and organizational theory, this is paradoxical (Heylighen, 2007): why would anyone provide such valuable services to others without being either paid or ordered to do so? Several authors have investigated the motives that incite people to contribute to such communities (Ghosh, 2005; Lerner & Tirole, 2002; Weber, 2004). These include curiosity, altruism, free expression, need for belonging, desire for status and recognition, and the hope for future financial rewards for private consultancy after being publicly recognized for one’s expertise. More interesting for our purpose than these individual motivations, though, are the structures and processes that encourage individuals to take part in such a collective enterprise, i.e. the underlying mobilization system. A first analysis (Heylighen, 2007) points at two fundamental mechanisms: feedback and stigmergy. By contributing a question, comment, answer, program, photo or any other input, participants hope to get a reaction from the other community members, because that would give them an indication of whether they are on the right path, or need to make some correction. Such feedback provides valuable information that allows participants to get better in whatever they are interested in. For example, a programmer who contributed a piece of code will benefit if a user points out a bug in that code, suggests a way to extend it, or simply confirms that the job was well done.
>
> ... gamification applies a variety of game mechanics, i.e. techniques that help to produce a compelling, engaging experience for the user or game player. They include:
>
> • challenges or quests, in which the player is incited to achieve some difficult objective, which the player has not reached before (i.e. novelty),
>
> • scores or points, to quantify all the small, step-by-step advances accumulated by the player, so that players get a continuous feedback about how well they are doing
>
> • levels, which represent larger, discontinuous transitions to a higher degree of game difficulty or status
>
> • competitions or leaderboards, where players can compare their achievements with those of other players, so that they are incited to do better than they did up to now
>
> • narratives, in which the challenges are situated within a concrete context or storyline, so that individual actions become part of an extended course of action within a meaningful environment
>
> • epic meaning, in which the impression is created that the player is working to achieve a goal that is particularly important or awe-inspiring
>
> • trophies or virtual goods, in which players receive virtual presents as a reward for their achievement
>
> • gifting, in which players get the opportunity to give virtual presents to other players, thus tightening links of friendship or cooperation.
>
> **Persuasive technology and the user experience**
>
> To be fully effective, the mostly social dynamics within communities and games needs to be supported by a good individual interface: users of a computer application should feel an intuitive understanding and control of what is happening, and be stimulated to explore and extend their mastery of the system. In other words, a good application should feel like a favorite tool or toy: easy and fun to manipulate. This essentially subjective appraisal is what is usually denoted by the rather ambiguous phrase of user experience... Some of the elements of well-designed user experiences are:
>
> • simplicity: the number of components or options on a given screen are limited, and common actions can be performed with a minimum number of steps
>
> • esthetics: color schemes and designs are calm, elegant and pleasant; images, sounds and movements are not coarse, grainy or jerky
>
> • interactivity: the tool responds clearly, distinctly and immediately to different user actions
>
> • intuitiveness: user actions have as much as possible the effects that a naïve user would expect them to have (Spool, 2005)
>
> • transparency: functions are self-explanatory, or can be understood after a minimal investigation
>
> • consistency: the same actions or interface elements always produce the same effects
>
> • richness: the tool offers an unlimited variety of content or applications to explore
>
> A good user interface will compel the user to extensively use the technology. The next step is a technology that compels the user to do something beyond the technology itself. Fogg has defined persuasive technology as “any interactive computing system designed to change people's attitudes or behaviors”... More generally, a persuasive system can be seen as an implementation of what has been called the extended will. This is a generalization of the idea that we use various information technologies as external memories, so as to “extend our mind” into the environment. But mind encompasses more than memory and information processing capability: it also includes the motivation, concentration and determination needed to act effectively—i.e. what is conventionally called “will”. In our present environment full of distractions and temptations, our willpower is heavily taxed. Therefore, in general we need external support if we want to make sure that we stick to our intentions... A good support will not only keep reminders of what needs to be done, but provide the right stimuli at the right moments to incite us to act in the right manner... Persuasive technologies will be more effective if they:
>
> • tap into real needs (e.g. combating the dangers of obesity)
>
> • present clear goals (e.g. realistic weight targets)
>
> • make it easy to do what is needed (e.g. prepare healthy meals)
>
> • give feedback about the progress made so far (e.g. compare your present weight with your initial and ideal weights)
>
> • provide clear visualizations of potential means or ends, so that users can easily imagine the effect of their future actions (e.g. a computer-generated photo of how you would look after losing all that weight)
>
> • make use of social pressure (e.g. by pointing out the achievements of others)
>
> • provide timely triggers to stimulate their users to do something (e.g. alarms to remind you to
exercise)
>
> **Principles of Mobilization**
>
> Now that we have reviewed a variety of specific technologies, it is worth trying to extract the general principles behind the mobilization of action. A first step is to split the problem into its two aspects: individual and collective. Individuals first of all need to be stimulated or motivated to act effectively. Then, their actions need to be coordinated so that they help rather than hinder each other, and collectively achieve an optimal result. Let us discuss these aspects in turn.
>
> **Individual motivation**
>
> Possibly the most useful paradigm to understand individual drive is the psychological concept of flow, which was derived from numerous observations of how people feel while performing different types of activity. “Flow” refers to the pleasurable state experienced when the activity, while intensely focused, proceeds in a seemingly effortless, flowing manner—because every action immediately elicits the next action, without any hesitation, worry or self-consciousness. In such a state, continuing the activity becomes the only real concern, while everything else is pushed to the back of the mind. That is exactly the kind of focus and commitment that we expect from a good mobilization system... The basic conditions needed to generate flow are:
>
> • the activity has clear goals;
>
> • every action produces an immediate feedback.
>
> • the degree of difficulty or challenge of the task remains in balance with the level of skill.
>
> The formulation of goals seems the most obvious requirement for focus and commitment: the goal functions like a target or “attractor” for the course of action, determining the direction for all future activity... An important aspect missing in typical flow models is that in order to produce enduring commitment a goal should correspond to something truly valuable... A more pragmatic list of motives relevant for mobilization systems could be the following:
>
> • (material) reward (e.g. receiving money or presents)
>
> • learning (acquiring new knowledge and experience)
>
> • belonging (being accepted as member of a community)
>
> • altruism (helping others)
>
> • status (being esteemed at least as high as others)
>
> • achievement (being able to look back with pride on what you did)
>
> The second component of the flow model is feedback. Knowing the general direction in which your actions should lead is not sufficient to effectively get there: you should make sure that every action has the intended effect. If the effect is not exactly what you expected, you will deviate from the planned course of action. Even tiny deviations will gradually accumulate into a large deviation, so that you may completely miss the target. The only thing that allows you to correct such deviations is feedback: a response signal that informs you to what degree and in what direction you have deviated from the intended path... The flow paradigm emphasizes the immediacy of such feedback. Indeed, if a feedback signal would only arrive after a finite interval, deviations could grow during that interval. Even when the actual deviation would remain small, the absence of feedback would create a growing sense of uncertainty about whether you are following the right course of action. And this uncertainty is precisely what feeds the anxiety, hesitation and procrastination that we would like to avoid. Vice-versa, each feedback signal is either a confirmation that you are on the right track, or an indication of how you can get back on the right track. Therefore, any feedback signal, even if negative, boosts your effectiveness, and therefore self-confidence, in continuing your activity, adding to the sense of flow... Not just the immediacy, but the richness of the feedback helps to maximize flow... Complex activities can go wrong in many different aspects. Each aspect defines a dimension or degree of freedom in which the course of action can vary. Effective feedback would inform you about the precise degree and direction of the deviation in each of these dimensions, so that you know what correction to make.
>
> The final requirement for flow is the balance between challenges and skills. This means that the task should not be too difficult for the level of skills available, but not too easy either... There are two ways to control the balance between challenges and skills: changing the intrinsic difficulty of the task, and changing the person’s ability to cope with the task... limited skills applied to limited challenges merely produce apathy, as there is not much to create interest. This means that a good mobilization system not only should present goals that are difficult to reach, but provide the additional abilities necessary to handle that difficulty. This is the “new skills” feature that characterizes a truly compelling technology: you will feel most stimulated to use a tool if it allows you to tackle challenges that you could not tackle without it—albeit in such a way that its use is fully intuitive and transparent. Eventually, a good tool should start to feel like an augmentation or extension of yourself...
>
> **Coordination**
>
> When several people work together, their actions need to be coordinated. This means, minimally, that the actions do not obstruct or oppose each other (conflict, friction); ideally, that the actions complement each other in such a way that together they achieve more than separately (cooperation, synergy). In other words, coordination can be defined as the arrangement of actions across people, places and times so as maximize synergy and minimize friction. In earlier work (Heylighen, 2012b), we have analyzed coordination into four components: alignment, division of labor, workflow and aggregation. *Alignment* is the most obvious requirement for synergetic action: the different actions and agents should point towards the same target(s). This means that the overall goals or values of the participants should be consensual rather than conflicting. Consensus can be achieved explicitly or implicitly. The simplest explicit method is voting: of the different objectives proposed, the ones that gather most votes within the community are chosen as priorities... A better method lets dissenters propose arguments for why they like or dislike certain options, so as to allow a more reasoned (and in general more broadly supported) consensus to emerge... Alignment can also happen implicitly or spontaneously, like in a conversation where people mutually adjust their way of communicating without being aware of it. Such self-organization is typically driven by a positive feedback, where the more alignment there already is, the more the remaining people are incited to align to that emerging standard... When the target is not as simple as a time and place for meeting, alignment on a common outcome tends to be a slower and more complex process. Here too, technology can facilitate what is in essence a self-organizing process... The underlying coordination mechanism here is *stigmergy*: contributors are in general not arguing with each other, but with the aggregated “trace” of all previous contributions, by making what they consider improvements here or there... Except for the most controversial issues, this back-and-forth editing tends to converge to a version that is acceptable to all. Stigmergy is also an excellent mechanism for achieving a *division of labor*: different people normally have different abilities. Therefore, the most efficient organization of a collaborative work is to let every person do that part of the work that s/he is best able to do... *Workflow* is the serial complement to the parallel division of labor: a complex activity must in general be decomposed not only in tasks done simultaneously by different people, but in tasks that have to be done in a particular order or sequence. The “flow” in this case denotes the smooth transmission of a partially finished work from person to person along the sequence. Workflow too can be implemented in a simple manner using stigmergy: as soon as someone has finished part of the work, s/he leaves the result in the shared medium, ready to be picked up and continued by the next person capable and willing to work on it... The final requirement for effective coordination is *aggregation*: the assembly of all the different contributions into a coherent end product. Aggregation of results in a communal memory is the essence of collective intelligence, as it synthesizes the diverse points of view, experiences and knowledge of a group of individuals into a “wisdom of the crowd”. Again, stigmergy provides a robust default mechanism: people add their contributions to a shared, structured workspace... thus ensuring that they become part of an articulated whole. In the case of voting or other quantifiable actions, averages or distributions can be calculated automatically by the system so as to reflect the collective wisdom of the community...
>
> **Synergy between individual and collective mobilization**
>
> At first sight, (individual) motivation and (collective) coordination may appear like independent functions that are better implemented in separate systems. However, some further thought makes it clear that the one directly reinforces the other. Committed and focused individuals are more dependable. Therefore, it will be easier for them to collaborate in an efficient, coordinated manner. Moreover, committed individuals will be more enthusiastic and persuasive in getting others to join the cause, thus extending the group of “aligned” people. Vice versa, when individuals feel aligned in their goals with others, they become more motivated to work towards these goals. This can be explained by the universal motives of belonging and altruism. When others want the same as you, you will feel a sense of group solidarity or kinship with them, so that you become more committed to work for that community. Furthermore, the more people around you are already aligned in their goals, the more you will be inclined to adjust your own goals and values to theirs and thus join the group. Indeed, one of the most effective ways to motivate people to do something is to point out that others already do it. This can be understood from the universal drive to imitate others and to conform to group norms. In conclusion, motivation boosts alignment, while alignment boosts motivation. Additionally, coordination boosts the sense of achievement: the more efficiently you collaborate with others (e.g. because of good workflow, division of labor and aggregation), the more difficult the challenges you will be able to tackle, and therefore the more flow you will experience. This mutual reinforcement between individual and social stimulation explains why the most effective mobilization tends to be found in communities—although we must not forget that mobilization systems are also very effective for encouraging purely individual activities. Finally, it is worth noting that the basic mechanisms for motivation and coordination, respectively flow and stigmergy, are in essence two sides of the same coin. Both describe the close interaction between an agent (the user) and a medium (the system or technology), so that an action by the one incites an immediate response by the other. In the case of flow, the focus is on the feelings of the user, with the medium merely providing the targets and feedbacks needed to keep the user fully engaged. In the case of stigmergy, the focus is on the state (“trace”) of the medium, which develops through the subsequent user actions it incites, up to the point where it offers an aggregate solution to whatever challenges it started out with. The coordination between different user actions is merely the byproduct of the fact that all users share this stimulation by the medium, and thus effectively act in the same workspace on the same overall task. The upshot of this symmetry between flow and stigmergy is that a technology good for the one will in general also be good for the other: both require a medium that is very responsive, high-bandwidth, and multidimensional, so that it can aggregate plenty of fine-grained data while presenting clearly articulated challenges and feedbacks to its users. That is why the most effective mobilization systems will both incite individuals and coordinate communities.>
> ... Mobilization technology may help us to align the scattered wishes, desires and intentions of millions of people, thus gathering the momentum, engagement and “political will” necessary to tackle truly global problems...
>
> **Conclusion**
>
> We have defined a mobilization system as an ICT-supported form of organization that stimulates or motivates people to work towards some goal(s), while efficiently coordinating their actions. The need for such systems follows from the overload of information, distractions and choices that we are confronted with. This bombardment with scattered stimuli produces anxiety, hesitation, and procrastination, while making it difficult to remain focused and committed. Collaboration between uncommitted, distractible and stressed individuals without clear objectives is highly inefficient. Working at cross-purposes in such an erratic, fragmented manner can only waste resources... The most critical question for the future, therefore, may be not so much how to create efficient mobilization systems, but how to control them and for what purposes to use them. Here too, stigmergy may come to our rescue, by supporting large-scale discussion of the issues and facilitating alignment on broadly supported goals, guidelines and regulations. A worldwide alignment on the most important values, targets, and strategies may even create the equivalent of a will for the emerging “global brain”—the collective intelligence formed by humanity supported by its information and communication technologies. Such a broad consensus on what to do next may well be the ultimate reward, as it would enable a coordinated attack on the most pressing problems of our age: climate change, war, poverty, disease..." - [Mobilization Systems: technologies for motivating and coordinating human action, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MobilizationSystems.pdf)

liquid democracy can be used to inform how recommender systems work for any field - not just for political questions. Even content moderation

> "- Base-100 Vote: Voters have 100 points that they can cast for any voting issue, they can distribute those points arbitrarily in the network; this allows voters to express “partial agreement” or “partial disagreement votes” with issues and/or particular nodes, giving an unprecedented capacity of plasticity, specificity, self-organization, malleability, resiliency and robustness to the network. Example: A voter wants to automatically issue 50 of his 100 Points for Health-related issues to his doctor, 20 points to a family member that has knowledge in a related field, and keep 30 points for himself.
>
> - Negative Voting: Voters can use their points to subtract representational power from other individuals or groups who they feel are gathering too much weight in the system or that represent interests contrary to their stance. Example: A voter wants to use some of the points to mitigate the perceived excessive influence of an individual, while also issuing some of the points in favor of someone who holds a position that is considered to deserve more weight in the system.
>
> - Embedded Preference: Voters can propagate their points to their selected representatives with an embedded preference, so the representatives can know what is the personal intention of their representees, and might or might not choose to follow their recommendation. Example: A voter indicates that he is in favor of a certain level of tax, but his representative might choose to cast a vote that is different to that initial preference (The latency system will always offer the owner of the points the chance to certify the use of their voting power)
>
> - Divided Voting: Voters might want to vote for individuals or issues that are inherently in opposition to each other, maybe as a way to express their recognition for good political work on different individuals or groups holding different stances, or simply because there is an actual indecision or ambiguity, or because they want to leverage the playing field by making a certain decision more contested. This confers the system a virtually infinite capacity of self-correction and nuanced complexity. Example: A voter might want to use some of the points to support “Individual A” while also recognizing the validity of argument presented by “Individual B”
>
> - Transparent or Secret Voting: Voters might chose to cast their points in a public or private way, they can even hide their points from the recipients, to avoid them from playing into populist positions. This quality of the system also reduces strategies of preference falsification that is intrinsic to a scheme that only allows for secret voting, as no user has any evidence of what a certain voter really stands for; by having public voting as an option, individuals can confirm what are the actual positions of other nodes in the network. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Vote History: Voters have total control over the historical use and current holders of their representational power. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Boolean & Gradient Voting: The community can vote on boolean (binary) and gradient-ed (nuanced) issues, as the total amount of votes can indicate not only if a decision should be made, but also how much of that decision should be implemented. Example: Should drones fly at +30000 feet with commercial planes? (Yes/No) ? Once the community has voted for “No”, then a vote can be issued about what is the maximum flight at which drones would be allowed to fly (0 ft. to 29 999 ft.) in which case a Bell-Shaped curve of votes would probably result on drones maximum fly height to be set at ~15 000 ft." - [Competency-Based Propagative Democracy](https://ernestoeduardo.medium.com/propagative-democracy-c00e5d327194#:~:text=Base%2D100%20Vote,15%20000%20ft.)

digital marketplaces: from closed centralized walled gardens to merging them all into one global medium for exchange

> "Electronic marketplaces are built to resemble real marketplaces structurally. Consequently, they are centralized systems, walled gardens with an intrinsic tendency to lock merchants and clients in. We argue that this structure is not necessary on the Web and that **all online marketplaces could merge into one global medium for exchange**. In this paper, we propose an architecture for such a medium based on semantic Web standards, encompassing the functionalities of publishing an intention to buy or sell, finding transaction partners, and conducting transactions." - [A Linked Data Based Messaging Architecture for the Web of Needs](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_266970.pdf)

traditionally supply is explicit and can be pointed to, while demand is implicit and does not have a representation - an asymmetry. We can make demand explicit as well and have it represented by an object with a standard interface so that we can better match supply with demand and matchmakers can compete.

Kickstarter is a very simple version of expressing and aggregating demand before supply exists

> "Marketplaces have been known to man for several thousand years. Their historically consistent overall form, a collection of kiosks with goods being offered, and many independent clients buying there, is due to the fundamental asymmetry at the basis of all trade: the asymmetry between its two poles, between supply and demand. **Although, conceptually, supply and demand can be said to be of the same kind, namely intentions of taking part in a resource transfer, they differ substantially. Supply appears as the thing being offered, it is thus concrete, can be searched and found, measured and compared. Individual demand, in contrast, denotes the absence of something, thus it does not appear as a physical thing in a traditional marketplace. The same asymmetry pertains to supply and demand on the Web: supply is mostly explicit, has its own representation, such as a product landing page, whereas demand is rarely published as an individual resource.** The work at hand aims for reducing this asymmetry. The first step in this direction is to **represent both, supply and demand, explicitly as distinct objects on the Web, and to provide a standardized way for them to communicate**. Given these prerequisites, **the problem of finding a suitable partner for a resource transfer is equivalent to finding a suitable combination of one supply and one demand object.** The search for such combinations can be performed manually or automatically by participants from the demand side as well as from the supply side. Moreover, independent entities can assume the role of a matchmaker and inform the participants involved. In order to allow for independent matchmaking, a standardized way of informing supply and demand objects of a possibly interesting combination is required. This set of functions (publishing the intention, performing search or matchmaking, and establishing a communication channel) provides a symmetric base for resource transfer on the Web. This set is minimal and necessary, as no function could be removed without losing the overall functionality." - [A Linked Data Based Messaging Architecture for the Web of Needs](https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/publik_266970.pdf)





> "The main applications of the Internet are likely to become integrated into a single, universal system for coordinating all the activities of the people and machines on this planet. Such a system would immensely reduce the confusion, friction and waste caused by poorly aligned activities, while boosting the synergy of collaboration. Complemented by on-going technological innovation, the resulting increase in productivity would create an economy of abundance, where all needs can be satisfied at negligible costs. The combination of abundance with an intelligent, bottom-up system of coordination should eventually produce a solution for all the major problems that plague humanity, including global warming, poverty, inequality and conflict. This utopian but realizable scenario for the mid-term future has been called “return to Eden”." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Society is an autonomous system: it is able to survive and grow by solving the problems or exploiting the opportunities that it encounters—and this without need for outside direction. It recognizes such challenges through its (largely implicit) value system, which evaluates certain conditions as beneficial (e.g. education, shelter, drinkable water, peace, …) and others as harmful (e.g. hurricanes, pollution, crime, disease, …) to its development. It tackles these challenges by analyzing and interpreting the situation, and by initiating actions to deal with it (e.g. purifying water, building houses, curing people from disease, preventing crime, …). This means that society possesses an implicit store of knowledge and an intelligence that applies that knowledge by making the necessary inferences and eventually reaching decisions about the actions to take. This intelligence is not localized in a central executive, such as a king or government, that would command and control the social system. It is rather distributed over billions of individuals, organizations, networks, documents containing specialized knowledge and regulations, computer programs, and machines that perform actions. Thus, the intelligence of society is similar to the one inherent in the brain (Minsky, 1988), where knowledge and inference processes are distributed across billions of neurons and their connecting synapses." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Demand in the economic sense is measured merely by the price agents are willing to pay for the thing they desire. This ignores the desires of agents that lack money, or their desires for things that cannot be bought—such as friendship, clean air, or democracy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The process of coordination between all the offers and demands that exist in the world remains highly inefficient. This creates a selective pressure for the development of a universal coordination protocol that would interconnect and eventually absorb or replace all existing sharing platforms—just like the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol did with all preceding computer networks. Thus, such a protocol would eliminate all the intermediaries, enabling immediate peer-to-peer transactions via an open, free, public medium. Such a medium for synergetic interaction would provide the foundation for what has been called the “collaborative commons” or “automated commons”, i.e. a vast virtual space in which anyone can share anything. This would completely change the rules of the present economy." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In spite of its flexibility and apparent universality, a money-based, capitalist economy has a number of well-known shortcomings. Most generally, money or price as a onedimensional variable is much too coarse to express how various offers and demands differ in value according to multiple criteria—such as size, ease of use, beauty, sustainability, or social impact. In particular, there are fundamental values—such as happiness, love, or clean air— that intrinsically do not have a price, because they cannot be transferred from person to person and therefore have no exchange value. Moreover, human psychology does not treat value or preference as what mathematicians call a total order, but as a partial order: some things cannot be unambiguously ordered according to their value; in some contexts we prefer the one, in other contexts the other. Therefore, value can in general not be reduced to a universal, one-dimensional quantity." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There is another fundamental shortcoming of money. Because it can be exchanged for about any good or service, it is in practice the most powerful resource to possess. Moreover, its power increases proportionally to the amount you have: with double the amount of money, you can buy double the amount of things. Its linear, numerical character further means that it can be  accumulated unrestrictedly without losing any value. In this it is different from most other values, such as food, shelter or rest, which are subjected to diminishing returns: once you have had enough, you do not benefit by getting more. This has turned money into the dominant value of our society. Thus it has pushed aside values such as sustainability, community, happiness, or wisdom that are more fundamental, but more difficult to quantify or to accumulate. As a result, for many people money has become its own reward—rather than a means to a more basic end such as well-being, self-actualization, or social harmony.
>
> The dynamics of accumulation moreover leads to inequality, according to the wellknown positive feedback of the rich getting richer: the more money you have, the easier it is to invest surplus money in property, stocks or innovations that will get you even more money. This leads to the concentration of wealth in an ever-smaller group. An unfortunately common side effect is the poor getting poorer: the less money you have, the more difficult it is to invest in any business or form of self-development, such as education or health care, that would increase your income. What is worse, you will also have more difficulty to pay your general cost of living, and to find the resources, time or energy to tackle any unexpected problem that may occur. This makes it likely that you end up in a spiral of accumulating debt and the concomitant poverty.
>
> This [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) is boosted by globalization and the Internet: the easier movement of money, goods and information increases the reach of the most successful, thus increasing their profit, while reducing the profit of the less successful—even when the things they offer are virtually identical. The positive feedback of the Matthew effect in a sense negates the negative feedback of the invisible hand, where increase of demand is supposed to increase supply and thus again decrease demand. People who fall into poverty, e.g. because of illness, unemployment or debt, actually have a greater need for things like medical care, accommodation, and transport than people who live comfortably in their own home from the interests on their savings. But that demand is ignored by the invisible hand because poor people have no money to pay for the things they need. Therefore, as their situation worsens because they do not get what they need, their real demand increases rather than decreases.
>
> Another form of positive feedback is produced by speculation, which is a demand for things that are bought not for their intrinsic worth, but for the sole reason that they are expected to increase in price. Thus, increasing demand can lead to an expectation of prices increasing further and therefore to even higher demand. This vicious cycle produces the bubbles, booms and busts typical of a capitalist economy, and the concomitant market volatility and economic crises. This instability too is amplified by the easier movement of capital across the Internet.
>
> In sum, while money appears like a simple and flexible medium for matching offer and demand, in practice it produces a strongly distorted picture of the actual demand, ignoring many fundamental needs and values of society, while creating speculative demand for things that are not intrinsically valuable. Thus, it amplifies minor differences into growing inequality and instability." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "In a small enough community everybody knows everybody, so that the community members have a good idea of who has given what and who has received what. People who give more than they receive gain prestige or reputation. On the other hand, people who take out more than they put in lose reputation. People with high reputation are more likely to receive what they want if they express a demand. This motivates them to increase their reputation further by giving more. On the other hand, if someone’s reputation would drop beneath a certain level, then people would stop giving anything, thus effectively excluding that person from the community and its benefits. This is an effective measure against free riders. Still, the needy—such as children, old or ill people—will not suffer loss of reputation even if they cannot reciprocate, because the community knows that they are not willfully abusing the system, and have made or will make contributions in other periods of their life.
>
> Such a gift economy can only work in a small community where there is a sufficient collective knowledge of people’s overall needs and contributions to keep the exchanges approximately in balance. This ability to survey the whole system—which Jean-François Noubel has called “holopticism”—enables a form of distributed intelligence that flexibly coordinates offer and demand. Our present global economy is much too complex for any individual or group to acquire such an overview of all the exchanges that occur. Nevertheless, thanks to the power of ICT the holoptic and balancing functions can be delegated to the emerging Global Brain, using the kind of production system algorithms we have discussed.
>
> To make this practically feasible we need to implement two additional features of a gift economy. First, we need the equivalent of a reputation system, which keeps track of the aggregate quality and quantity of the offers that each individual has made through the offer network, increasing that person’s reputation proportionally, while reducing it whenever the individual is observed to abuse the offer network. Computer-supported reputation systems have proven to be very effective in keeping vendors honest and constructive in online marketplaces and in motivating volunteers to make highquality contributions to open collaboration networks. While it will not be a trivial exercise to extend such systems to the level of a global offer network, it is likely that this will eventually happen through the same “disintermediation” dynamics that we have repeatedly encountered, in which local, mutually incompatible systems are eventually subsumed into a universal coordination protocol." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "There are a range of other motives that can stimulate people to act towards the common good, including altruism, curiosity, desire for feedback, and sheer enthusiasm for a particular cause (Heylighen, 2007b). With the help of a user-friendly, “gamified” interface and the social-psychological mechanisms of reputation, flow and [stigmergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy), a smart ICT system can stimulate and coordinate such motivations so as to produce effective collective action. This would turn the offer network into a mobilization system. That means that it would not only match existing offers and demands, but also elicit new offers for anything for which there is an unfulfilled need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The traditional solution to this problem is for the government to tax negative externalities, such as pollution, and subsidize positive externalities, such as education—thus  making globally beneficial transactions more attractive. The difficulty with this approach is that estimating the overall external impact of anything is extremely complex and situation-dependent, as it involves an unlimited number of known and potential effects and side effects. Taxation, on the other hand, needs to follow a set of simple rules, formalized as laws, that are set by a central authority. This only allows a coarse and rigid correction that is unable to adapt to the subtleties of a complex situation. Another difficulty is that the most important, long-term externalities, such as climate change or loss of biodiversity, are global, whereas the authority of governments is national and their outlook short-term. Therefore, governments typically have neither the power nor the political will to efficiently regulate such global externalities.
>
> How could a global offer network deal with externalities? One advantage of an offer network is that it does not reduce demand to an aggregate of discrete transactions in which one party is willing to pay money to one other party in order to obtain some specific good or service. Demand should rather be seen as a collective preference for certain outcomes rather than other ones. This includes demands for non-monetizable values such as clean air, biodiversity, peace, or freedom. An intelligent, “holoptic” offer network should in principle be able to track to what degree individual or collective agents contribute to satisfying such demands. Agents that add to the most important values would be rewarded by a general increase in reputation, and therefore in their ability to satisfy their own demands. Agents that contribute negatively to values would be penalized by a loss of reputation, and therefore a loss in their ability to produce further harm. Thus, the network as a whole would motivate agents to seek positive externalities and avoid negative ones.
>
> This mechanism already plays to some degree at the global level. For example, firms that are seen to participate in rain forest destruction or exploitation of low-wage laborers lose reputation and therefore potential income from clients who would rather buy from more conscientious competitors. Vice-versa, organizations that contribute to the global good, e.g. by building schools in poor African villages, gain in reputation and are rewarded with donations and volunteer work. At the moment, this propagation of reputation still happens via the intermediary of NGOs, government institutes or specialized groups, such as Amnesty International, Greenpeace or Unesco. These monitor otherwise obscure external effects, and use the mass media and the Internet to broadcast their observations so as to expand people’s awareness of the global situation.
>
> Because of the general disintermediation dynamics, it is likely that this monitoring and propagation of “external” reputation will become increasingly integrated with the universal protocols of the Global Brain. This means in particular that there would no longer be any independent authority, such as a government, NGO, or UN organization, to decide what is good or bad for society. Instead, the different “authorities” would themselves be subjected to the same kind of reputation mechanisms as individual agents. This makes it possible to compute a global reputation as an aggregate of evaluations by individual and organizational agents, weighted by their respective reputation scores. Such an aggregate reputation can be determined in an intelligent manner through the propagation of trust weights in a social  network, using an equivalent of the PageRank algorithm. The result would be a distributed measure of trust or authority that would be more balanced, more diverse in its outlook, and less easily corruptible than any central authority (such as a government) in estimating to what degree the overall effects of an action would be positive or negative." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "A long-term effect of externalities is that they can make the system unsustainable, either by the accumulation of waste or pollution, or the exhaustion of non-renewable resources. A money-based economy can to some degree deal with the exploitation of scarce resources via the price mechanism: as a resource becomes scarcer, its price increases; therefore more effort will be done to save it, or to replace it by a more abundant resource. However, since waste does not have a price, it is ignored by the “invisible hand”, and therefore the market has no incentive to reduce it. Taxing waste or pollution is a traditional way of reducing this problem.
>
> However, an offer network can do better, by considering waste as an unconditional offer entered into the system. The network’s coordination algorithms would not only try to maximize the satisfaction of demands (“backward chaining”), but also the exploitation of offers (“forward chaining”). That means that they should search to match this offer of “waste” with some sequence of production rules that may convert it into something for which there is a demand. For example, the grape seeds that are a waste product from wine making can be transformed into grape seed oil, which in turn can be used for the production of food, while plastic from packaging can be reconverted to produce inexpensive park benches and toys.
>
> Thus, a well-balanced offer network should maximally recycle any “waste” that is produced as a side effect of satisfying demand. The realizability of full recycling is demonstrated by Chemical Organization Theory, a mathematical formalism based on “reactions” similar to the ones we described as production rules. The theory shows that a network of reactions tends to selforganize into a self-sustaining subnetwork, where everything that is consumed is also produced, and vice versa. The algorithms supporting an intelligent offer network should help us to find such self-sustaining system of cycles more quickly and efficiently." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Another global challenge that offer networks may be able to tackle is resilience. Complex networks of interdependencies are vulnerable to cascading failures: whenever part of the network is damaged by some unforeseen perturbation (e.g. an earthquake, a bankruptcy, an electricity overload, a computer virus) this problem may start to propagate through the network more quickly than it can be contained, until the network as a whole breaks down. This is for example what happened with  several large-scale electricity blackouts and with the 2008 financial collapse. A system is resilient if it can recover from perturbations before it is irreversibly damaged. Strategies to achieve resilience include:
>
> • preventing the positive feedbacks that make local disturbances cascade into global problems;
>
> • increasing the diversity of the components of the system, so that a problem affecting one is unlikely to affect others;
>
> • increasing redundancy, so that there are sufficient components to take over the function of those that were damaged; and
>
> • accurately monitoring (potential) problems so that they can be remedied before they get out of hand.
>
> All of these strategies are supported by offer networks. The envisaged surplus of offers creates a buffer against potential scarcity. The great diversity of available offers and methods to connect offers and demands provides sufficient redundancy so that demands can be satisfied even when the traditional supply routes are disrupted. This is similar to how the TCP/IP protocol made the Internet more resilient than rival networks, by providing a wide variety of alternative routes for retransmitting information packets that get lost. Moreover, the offer network would create a fine-grained map of the different needs the moment they appear, while providing intelligent algorithms that mobilize and route offers immediately to the place where the need is highest. Finally, because it does not rely on the accumulation of money, it prevents the positive feedbacks of speculation and the [Matthew effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect) that can lead to financial collapses and growing inequality." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The first requirement for a universal offer network: all users and supporting programs should use the same, unambiguous language for representing conditions and actions. If I need something specific from the offer network, I should be able to formulate that need so that the network can recognize that it matches the offer that someone else has formulated. Natural language tends to be too ambiguous for the purpose, because words can have many meanings or just be too vague to express what I need." - [Towards an Intelligent Network for Matching Offer and Demand: from the sharing economy to the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Mathematically, one may say that human beings’ value systems are “partial orderings” – they allow a person to say whether X is more valuable than Y, in a certain context. But money requires something stronger than this – it requires the arrangement of all entities to be valued in a “total ordering”, so that any X and Y can be compared as to their relative values. This has the merit of simplicity; it allows values to be arranged along a number line, so that one can assign each entity whose value is of concern a single number representing its value. But it has the shortcoming of not actually agreeing with the way human minds think and feel about values. In a partial ordering, mathematically, two entities X and Y may simply be incommensurable. NRdimensional vectors (for N>1) are like this; it doesn’t always mean something to say that vector X is “greater than” vector Y. In a value system that is a partial but not total ordering, there may be entities X and Y whose values are incommensurable – there is no clear answer regarding whether X is more valuable than Y or vice versa. This is how human value systems work, even though it’s not how money works." - [Offer Networks, a Potential Infrastructure for a Post-Money Economy, by Ben Goertzel](https://globalbraininstitute.github.io/onet/files/offer_networks.pdf)

In these old ideas, as in Offer Networks, a massive integrative system was often posited to balance everyoneus desires against each other. But a critical difference is that, in the Offer Networks approach the clearinghouse doesnut try to determine what anybodyus needs or abilities are. Instead, people specify their offers based on their own value systems; and the clearinghouse just mediates the transactions, in a way that respects the various individualsu desires and values insofar as they have articulated them within their exchange offers." - [Offer Networks, a Potential Infrastructure for a Post-Money Economy, by Ben Goertzel](https://globalbraininstitute.github.io/onet/files/offer_networks.pdf)

> "Why are we willing to work so hard at things we don’t like doing, in order to buy so many things we don’t need? Part of the answer is addiction – we become psychologically addicted to certain routines and possessions, e.g. eating out in restaurants instead of cooking at home, or driving in a private car instead of taking public transport, or the feeling of wearing new & different clothes or jewelry. And part of the answer is social status. Having a lot of money is itself an indicator of high social status; and money can be used to buy other status indicators. A tremendous amount of money is spent on status symbols of one sort or another. Of course, money is not the only status indicator. Einstein had a very high status in the public eye, yet was not terribly rich. The same for Linux Torvalds. But overall, money is surely the best single proxy for social status in modern societies." - [Offer Networks, a Potential Infrastructure for a Post-Money Economy, by Ben Goertzel](https://globalbraininstitute.github.io/onet/files/offer_networks.pdf)

> "The most simple and common definition of intelligence is the ability to solve problems. A problem can be defined as a difference between the present situation (the initial state), and an ideal or desired situation (the goal state or solution). Problem solving then means finding a path through the “problem space” that leads from the initial state (say, x) to the goal (say, y). This requires determining the right sequence of steps that leads from x to y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Intelligence is highly context-dependent: more important than the absolute number of problems you can solve, is whether you can solve the most significant problems in your present environment. Adding the capability to solve some purely theoretical problems that are of no use in your present or future environment will in general not increase your fitness (i.e. probability of long-term survival)—and may even decrease it if it would make you waste time on contemplating irrelevant issues." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The simplest model of intelligence is a look-up table or mapping. This is a list of condition-action rules, of the form: if your problem is x, then the (action you need to perform to attain the) solution is y. In short: if x, then y, or, even shorter: x → y." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The next, more complex model of intelligence is a deterministic algorithm. This is a fixed-length or iterated sequence of actions that need to be performed on the initial state, until the state they produce satisfies the condition for being a solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The view of problem solving as computation or as heuristic search seems to imply a sequential process, in which the different steps are performed one by one. A first step in our intended generalization towards distributed, parallel processes is the reinterpretation of problem solving as information processing. The initial state or problem statement can be interpreted as a piece of information received by the agent. The solution of the problem is a new piece of information produced by the agent in response to the problem statement. The task of the intelligent agent is then to transform or process the input information (problem, initial state, “question”) via a number of intermediate stages into the output information (solution, goal state, “answer”)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Compared to the sequential models of intelligence, neural networks have two big advantages:
>
> 1) processing happens in a parallel, distributed manner, making it more robust and flexible;
>
> 2) the network does not need an explicit program to know how it should function: it can learn from experience.
>
> The distributed character of neural networks means that its information and “knowledge” are not localized in a single component: they are spread out across all the nodes and links, which together contribute to the final solution. This makes the processing much more robust: individual components may be missing, malfunctioning or contain errors; yet, the disturbances this introduces to the process are drowned out by the contributions from the other components when everything is aggregated. In a sequential process, on the other hand, every step or component through which the process passes constitutes a bottleneck: if that component breaks down, the process may never recover.
>
> The learning happens via a general “reward” or reinforcement mechanism: links that have been successfully used in producing a good solution become stronger; the others become weaker. After many experiences of successful or failed processing, the relative strengths of the different connections will have shifted so that the probability of overall success has become much larger. This intrinsically simple mechanism only works for complex problems because of the distributed character of the processing: if only the process as a whole could be rewarded or punished, this would not produce enough information for it to learn a complex, subtle procedure consisting of many different actions collaborating towards a global solution. Because the process is distributed, its components can learn individually, so that the one can be reinforced at the same time as its neighbor is weakened, thus rebalancing their relative contributions." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The view of intelligence as a capability for problem solving or information processing runs into a fundamental issue: what is a meaningful problem, or meaningful information? Why should an intelligent agent address certain problems or process certain information, and disregard others? In other words, how does an agent decide what to do or pay attention to? In the approach of traditional artificial intelligence (AI), this issue is ignored, as AI programs are conceived essentially as question-answering systems: the user or programmer introduces the question (problem, query, input), and the program responds with an answer (solution, output).
>
> On the other hand, the issue becomes inevitable once you start to design autonomous systems, i.e. systems that should be able to act intelligently in the absence of an instructor telling them what to do. Such a system should at least have a value system, i.e. a set of explicit or implicit criteria that allow it distinguish “good” outcomes from “bad” ones. Given the ability to evaluate or value phenomena, the agent can then itself decide what aspects of its situation are “problematic” and therefore require some solution." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The difference between positive (growth) and negative (deficiency) values roughly corresponds to the difference between positive and negative emotions. Negative emotions (e.g. fear, anger, or sadness) occur when a need is frustrated or threatened, i.e. when the agent encounters a perturbation that it may not be able to compensate. Positive emotions (e.g. joy, love, curiosity) on the other hand, function to broaden your domain of interest and build up cognitive, material, or social resources. In other words, they motivate you to connect, explore, play, seek challenges, learn, experience, etc. Negative emotions tend to narrowly focus your attention to the problem at hand, so that you can invest all your resources in tackling that problem; positive emotions tend to widen your field of attention so that it becomes open to discovering new opportunities for growth.
>
> A general theory of values should encompass both positive or growth values, and negative or deficiency values. The present paper will not further develop such a theory. Yet, it is worth pointing out that such a theory would be an important contribution to a general model of intelligence and of the global brain, and therefore definitely worth investigating. Some inspiration can be found in the various psychological theories of motivation or needs, which include fundamental needs/values such as security, social affiliation, achievement and knowledge. More generally, from an evolutionary perspective, all values can be derived from the fundamental value of fitness (survival, development, and reproduction), since natural selection has ensured that agents that did not successfully strive for fitness have been eliminated from the scene." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Valence can be understood as the subjective appreciation by an agent of the global utility, well-being or fitness offered by a particular phenomenon or situation. It can be formalized as a scalar variable, which is larger than zero for positive situations, smaller than zero for negative ones, and zero for neutral or indifferent ones." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "A challenge is a situation that carries valence for an agent, so that the agent is inclined to act, in the case of negative valence by suppressing the perceived disturbance(s), in the case of positive valence by exploring or exploiting the perceived opportunity(ies). More concisely, we can define a challenge as a phenomenon that invites action from an agent. Negative challenges correspond to what we have called problems; positive challenges represent affordances for growth or progress. But note that these are not opposites but independent dimensions, since a challenge can carry both positive and negative valences. For example, for a hunter, encounter with a wild boar is both an opportunity, since a wild boar has tasty meat, and a problem, since a wild boar is dangerous. For a company, a free trade agreement can be both positive, since it gives access to new clients, and negative, since it opens the door to new competitors. A challenge incites action because it represents a situation in which not acting will lead to an overall lower fitness than acting—because the agent gains fitness by taking action, loses fitness by not taking action, or both. Thus, a challenge can be seen as a promise of fitness gain for action relative to inaction.
>
> However, a challenge merely inspires or stimulates action, it does not impose it. The reason is that a complex situation will typically present many challenging phenomena, and the agent will not be able to act on all of them. For example, someone surfing the web typically encounters many pages that seem worth investigating, but obviously cannot read all of them. We may assume that an agent is intrinsically capable of choice, and that this choice will be determined partly by subjective preferences, partly by situational influences, partly by chance, i.e. intrinsically unpredictable, “random” fluctuations. Therefore, it is in general impossible to determine exactly how an agent will react to a situation, although it should be possible to derive statistical regularities about the most common choices. The implication for modeling is that an agent should not be represented as a deterministic automaton, but as a stochastic system, which may make different decisions in apparently identical cases, but where it is meaningful to specify conditional probabilities for the different choices, so that in a given condition e.g. 50% of agents can be expected to make choice A, 30% choice B, and 20% choice C.
>
> One of the reasons for this unpredictability is that agents have bounded rationality: they normally never have all the information or cognitive abilities necessary to evaluate the different challenges. They, therefore have to make “informed guesses” about the best course of action to take. Moreover, assuming that similar agents tend to look for similar resources, it is worth making a choice different from the choice of the others, so as to avoid competition for scarce resources. In addition to positivity and negativity, other dimensions worth considering in order to compare challenges are:
>
> - prospect (in how far can the agent foresee the different aspects or implications of the challenge?),
>
> - difficulty (how much effort would be involved in tackling the challenge?), and
>
> - mystery (in how far would tackling this challenge increase the agent’s prospect concerning other challenges?)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "A difference between simple relaxation models and challenge models is that intelligent agents (as living or artificial systems), unlike physical systems, must remain in a far-from-equilibrium state: they are constantly active, consuming energy, and trying to avoid at all costs a complete standstill (i.e. death). Therefore, while they are inclined to relax existing challenges, they will also seek new challenges (affordances, resources, opportunities), unlike physical systems. In that sense, a “challenge relaxing” dynamics only describes part of their behavior, and must be complemented by a “challenge seeking” dynamics that is better described by some form of active exploration. This is the equivalent of what we have called positive or growth values. It is illustrated in the brain by the fact that thinking never stops: activation does not simply diffuse until it fades away; action potentials are continuously generated by the brain itself, even in the absence of outside stimuli that play the role of challenges needing to be relaxed." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The challenge seeking dynamics can be represented by the fact that the agents are constantly confronted by a variety of new challenges, and that they are motivated to pick out the most challenging one of those as soon as the previous challenge has been relaxed. These challenges have an external origin: they are produced by the agent’s environment (which includes other agents as well as the natural and technological environment). We may assume that this environment is in a constant flux, so that agents are “showered” with challenging phenomena. Each of those is an opportunity to extract valence by acting." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Challenges have been defined as “invitations” to act, which means that the agent is not forced to take up the invitation. This is necessary because in general many challenges vie for an agent’s attention, and not all can be taken up. This becomes particularly clear if we imagine a hunter-gatherer exploring a stretch of rain forest with its thousands of varied stimuli, or a person surfing the web with it millions of potentially interesting pages. The agent’s capabilities for cognitive processing and action are limited, and therefore a selection must be made between these myriads of potentially important challenges. A model of challenge propagation ideally should include a system of selection criteria and mechanisms that help the agent single out the most significant challenges—however, without assuming that there is a single most important one.
>
> Some work that may be of help here is Baars’s model of consciousness, which assumes that within the brain many stimuli and thoughts compete for attention. However, only a single one can be amplified to the degree that it comes to dominate the “global workspace” that interconnects all the more specialized brain regions. From this workspace, the thoughts selected to be most important for conscious attention are “broadcasted” to the whole brain. This model presupposes a positive feedback mechanism where strongly activated thoughts become even stronger, while suppressing weaker ones, until a single “winner” remains. This is an example of the “winner-takes-it-all” dynamic common in non-linear, self- organizing systems. The suppression requires a mechanism of neural inhibition that may use some form of negative activation.
>
> Research on attention and consciousness (see my lecture notes on “Cognitive Systems” for a review) points to unexpectedness and valence as major criteria for winning the competition: stimuli that are surprising, and/or that are highly relevant for the present goal tend to attract most attention. The valence criterion is most obvious, as challenges that promise a higher reward than others deserve more attention." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "We are left with three fundamental criteria for deciding which challenges are most worth attending to: valence, surprise, and clarity. An agent is most likely to act on a challenge that entails high value (large potential gains or losses), that is mysterious, unusual or surprising, and where there is minimal uncertainty or ambiguity about how to act. Note that the surprise/mystery and clarity criteria at first sight may appear to be opposite. However, the uncertainty implied by surprise is one about the nature of the challenge (what is its true valence?), while the certainty implied by clarity is one about the choice of action (how should I deal with this challenge?). These are not contradictory, as an uncertain challenge (e.g. a mysterious envelope left on your doorstep) may well incite a clear action (e.g. open the envelope to see what it contains). It is clear that in such a case the challenge will have a high priority even though its valence is as yet unknown: you are likely to immediately open the envelope, even though you may be disappointed to see that it contains merely some irrelevant publicity." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Each agent dealing with a challenge will normally extract some benefit from it, while reducing some components, and leaving some others invariant. If we focus only on the invariant components, we get a model of information transmission similar to the spreading of memes: messages are passed on from agent to agent, without undergoing much change, until they have reached everyone that may be interested in the message. This could for example be a model of the diffusion of a particular innovation, fashion, or scientific theory.
>
> If we focus on the variable components, we get a model of the self-organization of workflow and division of labor: different agents perform different tasks that are part of a common challenge, and then pass on the remaining challenge to others with different skills and/or needs, up to the point where nothing of value is left to extract, i.e. all tasks have been done. To better understand such distributed processing of a challenge we will need to investigate the dynamics of propagation from agent to agent." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "There are two paradigmatic cases of challenge propagation: stigmergy and propagation across a network. In the case of stigmergy, a challenge remains available in a public medium or workspace that all agents can access. If an agent decides to take on the challenge, it will perform some actions that change the state of the challenge and then leaves the modified challenge in the medium. At a later stage, some other agent may pick up the modified challenge, and perform some further work on it, again leaving the “traces” of its work in the medium—where it can function as a challenge for some further agent. Here, the changes in the challenge in a sense propagate in time, but not in space, as they always remain available in the same place. The medium either has a trivial topology (there is only one “place”), or its topology does not directly affect the propagation from agent to agent.
>
> The other paradigmatic case is a social or neural network, in which a challenge moves from agent to agent by following the available links in the network. Here, the topology of the network (which node is connected to which other nodes) fundamentally determines the propagation process: a challenge can move directly from agent A to agent B only if there exists a link A → B in the network. In the stigmergic case, the challenge can move from any agent X to any agent Y, without constraints. The only requirement is that Y should “visit” the shared medium some time after X deposited its modified challenge there. An Internet example of stigmergy is Wikipedia, where any person can modify any page at any stage independently of which other person has contributed to that page. An Internet example of networked propagation is email, where A can pass a challenge on to B only if A has B’s email address, and B has enough trust in A to take on challenges from A—which typically only happens if A and B have a social or organizational connection." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "As a general rule of thumb, the most interesting networks to explore will be those that are most similar in structure to the “natural” networks that we find in social networks, the Internet, or the brain. These all tend to have the following properties:
>
> - recurrent (links are directed but can form loops or cycles)
>
> - small-world (two arbitrary nodes tend to be separated by not more than a small number of links)
>
> - clustering (two neighbors of a node tend to be connected to each other)
>
> - power-law (many nodes with few links, few nodes with many links)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The connection strength of a (multi)link expresses the probability that a challenge will be successfully propagated across that link, i.e. that an agent in the output set would take up the challenge proposed by an agent in the input set. Link strength can be formalized most simply as the conditional probability P(B|A) that agent B would take on a challenge received from agent A.
>
> This probability can depend on different properties of the communicative connection between agents, including: trust (the degree to which the receiving agent takes challenges coming via the link from the sending agent seriously), power (the degree to which the sending agent can compel the sending agent to act), friendship (the degree to which the receiving agent is eager to do something for the sending agent independently of any power relationships), friction (the effort or energy that it costs to transmit the challenge across the link) and bandwidth (the detail and clarity with which information can be transmitted along the link). Link strength therefore may represent any and all of these properties." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Note that the success of the crossing (i.e. whether the receiving agent effectively addresses the challenge) depends first of all on that agent itself, that is, its selection criteria for relevance, and its capabilities for processing the challenge. The link strength merely represents the social-communicative aspect of the process, namely the relationship between sending and receiving agent determining in how far the receiving agent is likely to pay attention to the other’s challenges. If the two agents have a very weak relationship (like in two agents who don’t know each other but who both have read the same Wikipedia page), the probability of one picking up a challenge left by the other is a priori very low, and will be determined almost exclusively by the properties of the challenge and of the agents rather than by their relationship. However, this low probability may be compensated by the fact that the multilink connects a very large number of agents, so that at least one agent in the output set is likely to pick up the challenge." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "The intelligence of the network could then be equated with the speed of decrease in the average length for all challenge vectors present in the network: the more quickly the network can “relax” its various challenges, the smarter it is.

> "While the development of such a model will still require a lot of research, the present analysis makes the problem much more tractable, by subdividing it into separate elements (such as challenge, agent and multilink), structures (such as topology of the network, or organization of the agents), processes (such as challenge selection, challenge processing, and challenge propagation), and measures (such as degree of relaxation, priority of a challenge, and overall intelligence)." - [Challenge Propagation: towards a mathematical theory of distributed intelligence and the Global Brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ChallengePropagation.pdf)

> "Intelligence is traditionally conceived as the ability to solve specific problems. We will here define it more generally as the ability to recognize and tackle challenges. A challenge is defined as an aspect of a situation that carries potential value. A challenge can be a problem to be solved (negative value) or an opportunity to be exploited (positive value), or some combination." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The more diverse and the more complex the challenges a system can tackle, the more intelligent it is. Tackling challenges requires selecting and performing an appropriate combination of actions. Performing these actions provides the system with benefit relative to not performing them. Thus, the ultimate measure of intelligence is the amount of benefit or value that the system can obtain by effectively dealing with the challenges it encounters." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "A general utility function cannot even be defined, because the same thing will have one value in one context, and a different value in another context. This means that a true intelligence, which would make sense of its situation and dependably create value, must be open-ended, constantly adapting its preferences to a changing world, rather than having preprogrammed goals." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "All agents— whether human or technological—that are part of the system would express the challenges they experience. Negative challenges correspond to problems, desires, or needs, i.e. perceived deficiencies between what the agent has and what it ideally would like to have. Positive challenges correspond to resources, opportunities, or offers, i.e. perceived surpluses where the agent has something that could potentially satisfy a need. Because of the distributed character of value, challenges are not objectively classifiable as positive or negative." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "The offer network protocol needs to represent the fundamental components of coordinated action: agents, actions, prerequisite conditions, problems to be solved (which we will call needs), and (partial) solutions proposed (which we will call offers)." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "This motivating power of reputation can be increased by allowing people with a sufficiently high reputation to take more out of the system than they put in, thus profiting from unconditional offers. However, exploiting such gifts without adding anything in return should gradually reduce their reputation, so that they are not inclined to take out more than their fair share. This ensures that they do not turn into “free riders” that consistently abuse the system." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Offer networks can also implement a more flexible form of social governance that has been called “libertarian paternalism”, “nudging”, or “mobilization”. The principle here is that there are no absolute obligations or prohibitions: everyone has the freedom to choose from the full range of available options. However, the options are arranged in such a way that the ones that are most beneficial to society (e.g. consuming vegetables, or taking courses) become easiest, most apparent or most attractive to choose, while those that are least beneficial (e.g. consuming tobacco, junk food or fossil fuels) require some special effort or motivation to go beyond the default choice. Socially beneficial “nudging” can be achieved by adding soft constraints that represent externalities, i.e. the costs and benefits to others of a transaction between private parties. These additional constraints would affect the order or priority of the solutions suggested by the offer network. For example, a less polluting option would get a higher priority even though it may fit the request somewhat less accurately. Like all other rules in the network, both legally binding and “nudging” rules should be made public and explicit, so that anyone can scrutinize them, evaluate them, criticize them, and if necessary propose alternatives." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "First, technologies that are initially formulated in a highly abstract, technical manner eventually get implemented in an intuitive, user-friendly manner, which requires minimal effort from their users. Second, when a system becomes truly useful, people become increasingly motivated to learn to use it in the most effective way, putting in the necessary time and effort to assimilate all the tips and tricks. Third, such usage eventually becomes part of general education—just like reading and writing evolved from highly technical activities performed by a small elite of experts to general skills expected from everybody. Finally, we already alluded to the virtuous cycle of stigmergy: the partial products (such as an incomplete Wikipedia article) of some, when clearly expressed in a common medium, stimulate and guide others to add their own contributions. Thus, contributions build on top of contributions, generating an increasingly rich and sophisticated system in which everyone may eventually find what s/he needs, and where poor material is eventually replaced by better material." - [The Offer Network Protocol: mathematical foundations and a roadmap for the development of a global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Roadmap-OfferNetwork.pdf)

> "Now what we know unfortunately as true is that that intelligence - while so impressive - is only very weakly predictive of rationality. You take all the standard measures for intelligence - they all strongly predict each other - you take standard measures for rationality - this is the work of Stanovich and others - they all strongly predict each other, so two strong positive manifolds, but the measure for general intelligence and the measure for general rationality are only correlated at 0.3. Intelligence is necessary but nowhere near sufficient for rationality. Why is that? Because think about what I said: you're intelligent by ignoring most of the information. Remember my example of your interaction with the woman: sometimes the information you ignore is exactly the information you need to solve your problem. You realize that in a moment of insight, but the opposite is also constantly possible for you - you don't realize, you don't realize that you've misframed the situation - you're finding the wrong things salient you and therefore you're judging the wrong things to be relevant or important. And we live in a world that is exacerbating that - Harry Frankfurt called that bullshit and I don't mean to be offensive - that's the term of his famous essay. The liar cares about your concern for the truth and tells you something and tries to get you to believe it to be true because of your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist does something different - they try to make something salient to you and have you not care about whether it's true or false - all advertising works this way." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1390)

> "We bashed out a consensus paper about what we think are the important features in wisdom. The dominant feature is perspectival metacognition. What does that mean? This is the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be able to shift perspectives. Shifting perspectives is one of the most powerful ways - I'm using my glasses like my mental frame - to get out of my mental framing. When I'm in a perspective what I typically can't see is the way the perspective is biasing me - I can't also take on interests and goals that are outside my perspective. But if I can take on his perspective or his perspective - that I can then look through them back on my perspective - I can actually overcome misframing.

> "But there are ways in which the collective intelligence can be subject to self-organizing foolishness - the bullshit can overwhelm us. And are we not now in a world in which the bullshit is overwhelming us more and more and more? How can the opponent processing of democracy degenerate? Well it can break down into polarization in which the emphasis on differentiation overtakes the opponent processing, or it can break down in group think, in echo chambers and bubbles that over emphasize the integration. We lose the complexification that allows us to deal with the complexity of the world and we stupefy ourselves into a kind of collective foolishness. When you have polarization the opponent processing breaks down into adversarial processing: one side is trying to destroy at all costs the other. And the problem with this of course is that debate depends on shared orientation - if we do not have a shared normativity we can't engage in debate. Groupthink also destroys the opponent processing because it reduces the multi-perspectival nature that is needed for collective wisdom - we're all thinking from the same perspective, we all have the same orientation. So either we don't have any orientation or we all have exactly the same one and the whole machinery breaks down." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1925)

> "I've been arguing at length that the West - whatever that is supposed to point to ultimately - is suffering from a meaning crisis or another way of understanding it is a wisdom famine. I will ask my students "Where do you go for information?" - they hold up the phone. "Where do you go for knowledge?" - science, the university. "Where do you go for wisdom?" - deafening silence. deadly silence. If our democracy is not educating us towards wisdom and alleviating the meaning crisis by understanding the embodied, enacted, embedded, extended nature of our cognition - it will not survive, because the meaning crisis - the wisdom famine - will overwhelm it. Debate presupposes a common unity, a community. It presupposes distributed cognition running collective intelligence that's being educated towards the wisdom of enhancing our connectedness, our meaning in the world. Without that, what we have is degenerate adversarial processing or echo chambering that is not addressing but in fact exacerbating the meaning crisis and the wisdom famine within propositional tyranny so all we have is endemic endless ideological warfare and the tsunami of bullshit that it generates. What is needed is a way of accessing collective intelligence and transforming it into collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=2272)

> "Reason is flawed, but how badly? How should success or failure in reasoning be assessed? What are the mechanisms responsible? In spite of their often bitter disagreements, parties to these polemics have failed to question a basic dogma. All have taken for granted that the job of reasoning is to help individuals achieve greater knowledge and make better decisions. If you accept the dogma, then, yes, it is quite puzzling that reason should fall short of being impartial, objective, and logical. It is paradoxical that, quite commonly, reasoning should fail to bring people to agree and, even worse, that it should often exacerbate their differences. But why accept the dogma in the first place?" - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027487-reason-is-flawed-but-how-badly-how-should-success-or)

> "Whereas reason is commonly viewed as the use of logic, or at least some system of rules to expand and improve our knowledge and our decisions, we argue that reason is much more opportunistic and eclectic and is not bound to formal norms. The main role of logic in reasoning, we suggest, may well be a rhetorical one: logic helps simplify and schematize intuitive arguments, highlighting and often exaggerating their force. So, why did reason evolve? What does it provide, over and above what is provided by more ordinary forms of inference, that could have been of special value to humans and to humans alone? To answer, we adopt a much broader perspective. Reason, we argue, has two main functions: that of producing reasons for justifying oneself, and that of producing arguments to convince others. These two functions rely on the same kinds of reasons and are closely related." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027493-whereas-reason-is-commonly-viewed-as-the-use-of-logic)


> "Sperber and Mercier see reason as an evolved module within the brain which specializes in producing reasons for our behavior. These reasons serve to justify our behavior to ourselves and others. It also enables us to evaluate the reasons proposed by others for their behavior. As such, it serves a primarily social role, one of coordination and cooperation, rather than an intellectual one of abstract problem solving... For Sperber and Mercier, what is important is that there is nothing unique about reason per-se, it simply operates on meta-level representations rather than low level primitives as most other inference mechanisms such as visual perception do.
>
> The authors propose that reason leads us astray in the pursuit of objective knowledge not because it is flawed, but because that is simply not what it evolved to do in the first place... Rather than reflecting some sort of transcendent capacity for pure abstract logic, human reason is often messy, and relies more on context and perceived relevance rather than stone-cold rules of logical deduction. Chief among these is the so-called myside bias (a generalization of confirmation bias), where humans produce reasons which reinforce their previously held beliefs. The myside bias ironically often leads people to become more wrong after thinking deeply about a problem than if they had to make a decision on the spur of the moment.
>
> ... If the hypothesis put forward by Sperber and Mercier is correct though, human reason isn’t even for problem solving, let alone for some hypothetical context-agnostic problem solving. Rather, it is for justification and explanation of behavior and decisions reached implicitly within an embodied social context. In this view, the so-called flaws in human reasoning which a superhuman intelligence would supposedly correct for are not even flaws, but rather the features of the mechanism working as they evolved to...
>
> All hope is not lost however, as the authors do discuss the conditions within which reason does in fact aid in the obtaining of objective truth or knowledge, and those are primarily social. For Sperber and Mercier, it is when reason is placed within its proper context, and humans are forced to justify and explain themselves to others, that reason does more than simply serve a social function. This is because critically, humans are better at evaluating reasons than we are at producing them. As a result, the bias towards producing reasons which justify our implicit decisions and the ability of others to find flaws in our reasons end up working together. These two abilities make possible open argumentation and debate to produce reasons which are better tuned to reality, and can thus ultimately drive better problem solving in the future." - [Thoughts on “The Enigma of Reason”, by Arthur Juliani](https://awjuliani.medium.com/thoughts-on-the-enigma-of-reason-11983c90cb75)

Sentences, in the form of propositions, carry meanings that can be questioned. This “question-answer dynamic” reinforces the process by which humans form networks of beliefs and values. UTOK calls these networks “justification systems” because they link together to develop a coordinated sense among people of what is and what ought to be the case. As such, they provide the structure for legitimizing how people think about the world and how they should behave." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=UTOK%27s%20Justification%20Systems,they%20should%20behave.)

# immune system & negative feedback
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

Yesterday, @MichelleObama announced she is partnering with a junk food company to sell sugar water to kids. We must speak plainly: this is a cynical cash grab. 
https://twitter.com/calleymeans/status/1654188254336528385

Transitive negative signals: anything relying on this even indirectly should be notified about X

we can reach a consensus what type of negative reputation we want to see

We can choose the types of negative reputation and we can vote on norms too

sunlight is the best disenfecatant

> "Advertising is legitimised lying." - [H. G. Wells](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/37198-advertising-is-legitimised-lying)


Its not advertising thats the problem - its the lack of negative reputation and the lack pf an immune system

Signaling slot machine tactics through negative reputation

we need to counteract market failures and negative externalities but currently we don't have the means to do so - we can't come to a consensus and organize

wealth leads to power over regulation which leads to making more money in the market - a positive feedback loop that doesn't have a counteracting force - such systems are unstable and self-terminate

Mary, you electrified the entire auto industry, you led, and it matters

What if we can flag stores for manipulative placement of goods - such as sugary stuff close to the isles and cashiers - because thats when people are tempted the most? Why cant we influence the real world?

Without negative reputation we cant develop an immune system
Our societal immune system to bullshit is handicapped - crippled

> "The adaptive immune system is a complex system involving different immune cells, signaling molecules and cytokines, however, the importance of different feedback and feedforward loops (FFLs) and the underlying crosstalks are often overlooked. In particular, negative feedback loops are very important in regulating the response that determines immunity vs. tolerance." - [Importance of Feedback and Feedforward Loops to Adaptive Immune Response Modeling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202469/#:~:text=The%20adaptive%20immune%20system,determines%20immunity%20vs.%20tolerance.)

Today's economy driven by advertising is mostly comprised of positive feedback loops but we also need to develop channels for negative feedback loops
a positive feedback loop: advertising tricks us into buying processed food which makes us sicker which takes a toll on our finances and happiness which leads to going back to food for pleasure
positive feedback loops in the economy are way stronger than negative feedback loops because of the disproportionate influence of money and advertising over us

> "Global Brain: The global brain can be defined as the nervous system of the global superorganism. This is the subsystem responsible for acquiring, interpreting, distributing and storing information. The components of the global brain are human individuals, their ideas and knowledge, together with the communication technologies they use to process, exchange and register these data. Thus, the global brain is more or less synonymous with the noosphere, which was characterized by Teilhard de Chardin as a “brain of brains”. The global brain is supported by the Internet, with human individuals or computer systems playing the role of neurons, and the network links between them playing the role of synapses." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance." - [Nikola Tesla](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/nikola-tesla-predicted-smartphones-in-1926-like-a-boss/)

> "The "global brain" is the name given to the emerging intelligent network that is formed by all people on this planet together with the computers, knowledge bases and communication links that connect them together. Like a human brain, this network is an immensely complex, self-organizing system, that processes information, makes decisions, solves problems, learns new connections and discovers new ideas. It plays the role of a nervous system for the whole of humanity. No single person, organization or computer is in control of this system: its "thought" processes are distributed over all its components.
>
> ... Similar to many mystical traditions, the global brain idea holds the promise of a much enhanced level of consciousness and a state of deep synergy or union that encompasses humanity as a whole. Theists might view this state of holistic consciousness as a union with God. Humanists might see it as the creation, by humanity itself, of an entity with God-like powers. Followers of the Gaia hypothesis have suggested that the "living Earth" of which we are all part deserves awe and worship; it therefore could form the basis of a secular, ecologically inspired religion. The Global Brain vision may offer a similar sense of belonging to a larger whole and of an encompassing purpose.

The global brain's intelligence, indeed its "mind" or "personality", emerges from the actions of all people collectively." - [The Global Brain as a New Utopia, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Utopia.pdf)


> "Self-organization is usually a slow and difficult process that needs to overcome a variety of obstacles, given that it needs to produce global coordination out of local interactions between agents that have only a very limited perspective on the whole. This is where Internet technologies can play a crucial role. They make it in principle possible for any agent (human or artificial) to interact in real-time with any other agent, while keeping a detailed trace of such interactions and their outcomes. This makes it easier to find, select and reinforce the interactions that are most effective in tackling problems, while eliminating the less useful ones. As a result, coordination and distributed intelligence can evolve much more widely, quickly and effectively.

the role of intentionality in birthing the GB

> "Self-organizing networks of communication, which are the fabric of all social structures, do have a potential of settling into overly constraining, rigid forms. This is currently one of the most fundamental points of debate within the Global Brain community and also one of the arguments in favor of a more active and normative approach. It is not enough to passively observe, describe and anticipate the emergence of a Global Brain, as earlier theorists have tended to do. We need to ensure that the fundamental diversity in perspectives and constant exploration, presented by Weinbaum and Veitas (2015) as a “world of views”, indeed becomes its operating principle. Therefore, we must actively engage in the conceptual, social and technological development of the Global Brain, and try to make sure that it is not hijacked by special interests, conformity pressures, or processes of homogenization. As Helbing (2016) puts it, in designing the future information society, “we should engage in systemic pluralism and should be much more experimental”, thus constantly expanding and renewing diversity." - [The Global Brain as a model of the future information society: An introduction to the special issue, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/TFSC-intro.pdf)

the GB as a process of intelligently coordinated interactions via distributed self-organization

> "As Veitas and Weinbaum (2016) conclude their paper: “No matter what kind of technologies will be enablers of the distributed social governance, it will be based not on the design of optimal institutions, but rather on the processes”. The Global Brain should not be thought of as a static agent, or even as an institution, but as a type of process: a process that explores creative possibilities, connects unconnected dots, and (re)cognizes and exploits potential synergies by bringing into contact the most diverse ideas, people and resources. A better metaphor for this phenomenon than the monotheistic God might be the Tao. The Tao is not an agent, but a “way”, a “path”, a principle of (self-)organization. Such mode of existence positions it below, not above, all other things and this is why “myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them” (Lao-tzu, 2006). In such a holistic, process-based perspective, there is no strict separation between body, mind and world, and therefore no homunculus acting as a central controller. There is merely an endless, encompassing stream of interactions being intelligently coordinated via distributed self-organization." - [The Global Brain as a model of the future information society: An introduction to the special issue, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/TFSC-intro.pdf)




the 3 historical approaches to the global brain (organicist, encyclopedist and emergentist) and how integrating evolutionary theory and cybernetics is the right way forward

> "Historically, I distinguish three approaches: organicist, encyclopedist and emergentist. While each of these conceptions provides an inspiring metaphor for understanding and guiding social development, each also has major shortcomings. The organicist perspective, by ignoring conflicts and competition and by studying the way things are, rather than how they might be or ought to be, tends to promote a status quo. The encyclopedist view, while inherently progressive, relies too much on rational planning and organization, and tends to ignore not only the potential for conflict, but also the intrinsic difficulty of unifying and centralizing something as context-dependent, complex and changeful as the world’s knowledge. The emergentist perspective, while emphasizing the potential for self-organization and radical evolutionary innovation, seems to suffer from wishful thinking, assuming that we just need to communicate more, become more conscious, or use technology to see a global brain miraculously emerge.
>
> I argue that these shortcomings can be overcome by integrating two existing theoretical frameworks: evolutionary theory and cybernetics. Biological evolution points us to the intrinsic sources of conflict, and how these have been overcome by evolving synergetic systems and control mechanisms against free riders. Cybernetics shows us how systems and control are organized in levels, and based on knowledge and communication. Evolutionary cybernetics introduces the concept of metasystem transition: the self-organization of individual components into a positive-sum system that functions at a higher level of intelligence and consciousness. More specific models associated with cybernetics, such as neural networks, distributed knowledge systems and stigmergy, help us to design concrete technologies that could support such a collective intelligence. The World Wide Web, finally, provides an extremely flexible and powerful platform for implementing and testing such technologies at the global level." - [Conceptions of a Global Brain: An Historical Review, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GB-Conceptions-Rodrigue.pdf)

> "Just like the neural networks in our brain, the global network processes this information in a distributed manner, with billions of human and technological “neurons” working in parallel—on partly the same, partly different data—while aggregating their results into collective decisions and actions. Unlike the centralized, tightly controlled systems imagined by AI theorists, this network functions like a complex adaptive system: a decentralized, self-organizing whole formed by an immense variety of interacting agents. This makes the overall system much more powerful, robust, and adaptive than a preprogrammed central processor that takes in information sequentially. As it adapts, this network learns from its experience by expanding and extending the most useful technologies, ideas, links, institutions, and agents, while setting aside and eventually forgetting the less useful ones. Moreover, it learns to ever better coordinate the activities of its components, by creating ever more direct and more powerful links between them. It thus increases its own intelligence. This increase can only accelerate as a more powerful and intelligent network also expands and develops more quickly.

The global brain perspective focuses on intelligence and fitness at the level of planetary society: the whole of humanity together with its artifacts and the ecosystems that it controls and relies on. This system of mutually dependent people, technologies and ecosystems defines the global superorganism.
>
> ... An essential part of that knowledge will be about the superorganism as a whole: how does the world function, and what opportunities and dangers can we anticipate? This requires, first, a general, transdisciplinary theory of complex systems and their networks of interactions: a global systems science. This theory would then be implemented as a living earth simulator: a comprehensive computer model of global society, the planetary ecosystem, and the way they interact. Such a simulation would allow us to anticipate the effects of different events or interventions on the global superorganism. That would make it possible to formulate a nearly optimal trajectory for global development, while as much as possible steering clear of conceivable obstacles, catastrophes, and negative side effects. However, in order to remain up to date and to adapt to unforeseen disturbances, this model would need to be constantly fed with new data. Moreover, it should be able to test out its hypotheses in the real world, so as to correct possibly inaccurate assumptions. A we noted earlier, this would require a very high-bandwidth interaction network, which Helbing call a planetary nervous system.

> "Many people abhor the idea of individuals being controlled by some collective, impersonal “system”, as this seems to deny them their personal freedom. Turchin spends quite some effort defending his views against any associations with the totalitarianism he knows so well, by emphasizing again and again the essential role of freedom and creativity. The rejection of control systems at the social level is more than a superficial emotional reaction to the negative connotations of the word “control”, though." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "A system that is formed by an integration of a variety of subsystems, together with a control co-ordinating and steering the actions of the subsystems, will be fitter than a mere aggregate of subsystems without overall control. It is intuitively obvious that if subsystems collaborate systematically in achieving a goal, they will be more effective than if they would behave anarchistically, without plan or co-ordination. The presently fashionable argument that no overarching plan is needed, since interacting actors will self-organize into stable and efficient patterns of interaction (the “invisible hand” of market forces), does not invalidate this proposition. The spontaneous ordering of a market is the result of complex communications and negotiations that lead to an overall co-ordination and constraint of the different actors’ behaviors. Once a perfectly competitive market has reached equilibrium, no participating actor is able to set prices that significantly diverge from those resulting from supply and demand requirements without being eliminated from the scene (“going broke”). One can debate whether the resulting economic order controls the actions of the participating actors, but it certainly constrains them." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "The problem is that everybody profits from cooperation, but that non-cooperators profit more, since they reap the additional resources produced by synergy, while investing nothing in return. This is the classical "free-rider" problem: everyone benefits from a public transport system funded by individual contributions, but the one who does not pay benefits most. Since evolution never stops, variation will sooner or later produce "free riders" in an otherwise optimized social system, and it is the latter that will be selected, not the earnest cooperators, resulting in the erosion and eventual collapse of the cooperative system." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

If actions are not chosen by blind trial-and-error, but are somehow preselected by a control system vicariously anticipating the possibly lethal effects of natural selection, the system will be obviously more fit. Once such a control is established, natural selection will primarily act on the control, rather than on the system itself." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "In almost all other species of animals, however, the different members of a group are able to independently reproduce their genes and thus keep open the possibility for erosion of any cooperative arrangement. This includes human populations. Yet human groups present some of the most extensive cooperative systems, comparable only to the social insects. This can be explained by assuming shared controls additional to the genetic one. Though we will discuss different types of control mechanisms in a later section, the most typically human mechanism can be found in culture: knowledge or beliefs shared between individuals through communication. A belief, piece of knowledge or pattern of behavior that is transmitted from one individual to another one can be said to replicate. In analogy to genes, such cultural replicators can be called "memes"." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "The most productive way to cooperate entails division of labor, each individual focusing on a different subtask while contributing to a common goal. Such independent action is not only easier because it requires less coordination and exchange of information, it is potentially also much more productive because of synergetic complementarity. If different individuals focus on gathering different resources, they will not only be able to avoid the fitness reducing effects of direct competition and arms races, they may even be able to directly enhance each other's fitness by exchanging surplus resources, like in the symbiotic relationship between alga and fungus. For example, in primitive tribes, one part of the population might focus on gathering fruit, while another part might focus on hunting. This will allow each of the two subgroups to develop greater expertise in their domain of specialization, and thus greater efficiency in collecting resources. The more differentiated the specialization becomes, the larger the domain of resources that can be explored by the collective." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "The competition between individual and group levels, which tends to be won by the inherently faster processes at the individual level, poses a fundamental obstacle to the emergence of an integrated, synergetic system at the group level. However, the development of a shared control, which restricts independent evolution on the individual level, provides a possible mechanism for overcoming this obstacle. Once some type of control is established, differentiation of roles within the social system is facilitated. In accordance with Turchin's "law of the branching growth of the penultimate level", increasing differentiation increases the selective pressure for developing social controls, which in turn feed back into increasing differentiation. This process in essence constitutes a social metasystem transition." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "Humans form effective, coordinated, division-of-labor groupings at several levels of aggregation. At each level, there is a problem of metasystem transition. At each level, there is not only competition between other groupings at the same level, but also competition between the interests of the smaller incorporated units and the interests of the larger encompassing unit. Primary, face-to-face, groups are incorporated into organized city-states, and these into nations. A plausible node of selection and inter-organization competition can be envisaged at each of these levels. Our skepticism towards Turchin's prediction about the inevitable organizing of nations into a single world government comes from the lack of any obvious node of selection at the whole-world, multinational level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Our previous position accepted the following: (1) Individual selection always dominates group selection at the biological level; (2) "Groups are real" (Campbell, 1958) as opposed to methodological individualism; (3) Self-sacrificial altruism in the service of human social groups genuinely exists; (4) Such altruism can only be produced by group selection. The solution was to limit group selection to non-biological cultural evolution and to see self-sacrificial altruism as a result of cultural group selection of ideologies, social-organizational traditions, moral indoctrination, and religious cosmologies. This point of view had many plausible implications, among them an explanation of why moral commandments and lists of deadly sins contain explicit rejections of innate human nature. There is also the obvious group-coordination utility of beliefs in rewarding and punishing afterlives and reincarnations, which extend perceived self-interest into an afterlife and thus can promote self-sacrificial acts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "Individuals with deviating beliefs or patterns of behavior can be held in check by different forms of ostracism or "moralistic aggression". If they are not convinced by the ever repeated messages transmitted by the other members of the group, the other members can simply force them to obey the rules, by punishing them as soon as a transgression is witnessed. This is a form of mutual monitoring. It implements the reciprocity of cooperation that is also found in "tit-for-tat"-like strategies. Conformist transmission and mutual monitoring together produce a sufficiently strong shared control to allow the evolution of extensive cooperation in small groups with close contacts: primary or "face-to-face-groups". However, when groups become so large that not all members are in direct contact with each other, it becomes difficult to maintain an overall shared control. Without reciprocal monitoring, deviant behaviors get a chance to develop. This can be controlled by two additional mechanisms: 1) by making the belief so strong that it controls behavior even in the absence of other group members reinforcing it (internalized restraint); 2) by developing specialized subgroups (e.g. police, militia, the judiciary) whose task it is to monitor and enforce the following of rules (legal control)." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "We understand internalized restraint to be the functional goal of the moral preachings of the great religions, where belief in reward or punishment in the afterlife is used to motivate the obeying of rules here and now.

> "Legal control, externalizing rules and systems for monitoring and reinforcing them, is typical for different types of modern states and bureaucratic organizations. From the different social control mechanisms it is the one that most strongly resembles the traditional concept of control as exerted by a separate, centralized, hierarchically superior system, that tries to reach an explicitly formulated goal by rewarding actions that contribute to reaching that goal, while punishing those that produce deviations. As a pure form, without mutual monitoring and internalized restraint, legal control requires an unaffordably large specialist corps to enforce it: you cannot put a policeman next to every citizen." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Differences in belief and involvement will create differences in context, and thus disagreements about the meaning of the law. But law in its effort to achieve universality and fairness must pretend that words have situation-free, formal meanings, denying their indexicality. Written and interpreted 'literally', the wordings allow loopholes and unintended uses never envisaged in their construction. The result is that in modern states, such as the present-day USA, enormous amounts of money and effort are invested in lawyers and legal research, just in order to try to interpret the rules in one's proper interest. The only possible countermeasure seems to consist in making legal formulations ever more formal, precise and explicit, anticipating ever wider ranges of particular conditions. The net result is that law seems to get ever more complex and difficult to manage." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "A fourth type of social control, market mechanisms, can again to some degree compensate the shortcomings of legal control, internal restraint and mutual monitoring. In market processes the intelligently selfish choices of all group members together curb the greed of single individuals, by making it unprofitable to ask for more than a "fair share". Similar to mutual monitoring, market mechanisms operate locally. This means they do not require an independent, centralized control organ, like legal control does. This makes them more tolerant and flexible, adapting quickly to new contexts or developments, but less reliable, and more prone to vicious cycles induced by small variations magnified by positive feedback ("boom and bust").
>
> Market mechanisms are quite efficient in the allocation of the factors of production (natural resources, labor, capital). Their main function is to regulate the diversification of effort resulting from division of labor. Markets create an equilibrium between supply and demand of goods or resources by adjusting prices (which are a consensual measure for the average value of a good). This ensures that when a particular good or service is in demand, there will quickly develop a sufficiently large group of individuals or firms specialised in providing it to meet that demand. Complementarily, when demand diminishes or supply increases (e.g. because of more efficient technologies), the effort invested in providing these goods will be quickly adjusted downwards, making more effort available for meeting other needs.
>
> The general mechanism is a negative feedback cycle where increase in supply via decrease in demand produces again a decrease in supply. Thus, large fluctuations are damped, and prices tend to stay around an equilibrium value. Although the negative feedback loop is the basis for cybernetic control, it is not sufficient on its own to create a control system. As Powers (1973) notes, cybernetic control requires amplification of the corrective reaction with respect to the initial perturbation: an increase in supply/demand above the reference level should produce a counteraction decreasing supply/demand more quickly than the initial deviation. Such a system very soon reaches a fixed reference or equilibrium state, from which it is very difficult to make it deviate. Market feedback, on the other hand, tends to be smaller than the fluctuation that caused it: after the demand goes up, it will go down again, but in general not so much as to reach its original level. Thus, the "equilibrium" value will slowly move, adjusting to outside conditions, which depend on the availability of resources, and the intrinsic needs of the public. It is this absence of an explicit norm or reference value that distinguishes market "control" from the other social control mechanisms, where religious values, moral and social rules, and laws provide the fixed reference against which behavior is evaluated. The variability of market feedback allows adaptation to new circumstances while still buffering the system against wild fluctuations.
>
> However, the concurrent danger is that when there is no stable underlying need or fixed store of exhaustible resources, feedback may become positive, leading to run-away processes. A traditional example is speculation, where an increasing demand makes people anticipate even higher prices, and thus gains for goods or assets bought now and sold later. Another example is technological development, where increased adoption of an innovative technological product (say an airplane or computer system) diminishes the costs needed to produce further units, and encourages the public to use that technology, rather than less well-spread competing designs. Thus, increase of supply leads to both further increases of supply and increases of demand ("increasing returns", see Arthur, 1988).
>
> Libertarian theorists and [laissez-faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire) economists recommend using market mechanisms as the overall control, while avoiding all centralized interventions except for the protection of private property and inherited wealth. Yet, we believe that market mechanisms cannot operate effectively without the contribution of the other social control mechanisms. The building block of market processes is the transaction, in which one good or service is traded for another one (or its proxy, money). A transaction is basically a "Prisoner's Dilemma" type of interaction, in which there is a short term benefit in defecting, i.e. profiting from the other party's investment without fulfilling one's own part of the deal. (For example one might refuse to pay for a service, or pay with counterfeited bank notes, or supply a defective good). It is just to counteract such tendency to defection that mutual monitoring, internal restraint and legal control have evolved. In particular, legal control is needed to ensure that contracts are fulfilled, and that goods are not captured through violence rather than trade. On a different level, legal control is necessary to ensure that positive feedback loops do not get out of hand, and that investments are made in areas where the lack of local or short term benefits precludes private investment.
>
> In a similar vein, Mancur Olson (1968) employs the tools of mainstream economics which are characterized by the hope that an "invisible hand" emerging from competition will provide the restraints needed for collective action. But he shows that from basic economic assumptions it follows that if each person is intelligently selfish in choices, "collective goods", including the benefits of cooperation, will be lost. (This agrees with Hardin's (1968) analysis of the “Tragedy of the Commons”, where competition exhausts the common resources.) He concludes that to solve "free-rider" problems some form of compulsion is needed.
>
> As an additional argument, we may remember that competition between similar systems tends to lead to arms races which decrease absolute fitness. For example, two companies producing essentially similar products (e.g. soft drinks) by similar methods and selling them for similar prices can only hope to increase their market share by spending more and more on publicity. This may lead to situations where more than half of the product's price is made up by the cost of advertisements, trying to convince the customer that one's product is better than the competitor's product. Market competition will in general only produce a positive sum if there is a differentiation in resource usage and production methods between the competitors, but, as we discussed, when the initial differences are too small, competition will hinder rather than stimulate further differentiation. E.g. when a particular way of producing soft drinks is well established it is quite risky for an existing company to distinguish itself from its competitors by promoting a new recipe: the chances are higher that it will lose customers used to a particular taste than that it will make new converts." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "A complex society like ours, characterized by a full division of labor, seems to require the presence of at least the four social control mechanisms outlined above. Each of these mechanisms functions at a different level of interaction. Internal restraint functions at the level of the single individual. Mutual monitoring functions between pairs (one to one) or small groups. Legal control is directed from an individual or small group to the whole (one to many)—and, if the controlling body is democratically elected, the other way around (many to one). Market equilibria emerge from interactions between all members of the group (many to many).
>
> Of these, only legal control can (arguably) be fitted into the classical, hierarchical control paradigm. This may explain Powers’s (1980) reluctance to recognize any kind of control at the social level. Yet, all these control mechanisms can be viewed as social constraints, curbing and modifying the selfish and nepotistic goals that control individual actions. They are thus working at the metasystem level (as defined in Heylighen, this issue).
>
> In spite of their sometimes wide-ranging and subtle effects it is obvious that the mixture of control mechanisms we see in our present society is far from optimal. What is most obviously lacking is any form of integration between these mechanisms. It is easy to imagine situations where the restrictions imposed by the different mechanisms are mutually inconsistent, religious tradition demanding one type of behavior, law another one, the market a third one, and peer pressure a fourth one. Moreover, each control mechanism on its own lacks an invariant focus: mutual monitoring varies with the local group of peers, legal control and internal restraint with national, organizational and religious frameworks, and market pressure with the vagaries of interacting positive and negative feedbacks, as exemplified by the chaotic movements of quotations at the stock exchange. Thus, in spite of the metalevel at which these mechanisms function it is as yet hard to recognize in society any integrated metasystem. The task of thinking through the problems of social control that are created by the on-going competition between the cooperators is merely starting." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Ravetz (1971) has pointed out the special problems of validity in large-scale or "industrial" science. In considering the episodes of scientific fraud that have come to light in recent years, face-to-face-group solidarity processes are relevant in two ways. On the one hand, they explain the cruel ostracism that whistle-blowers experience when they call attention to defects that would undermine "truth," organizational goals, or national goals. On the other hand, most discoveries of fraud are due to the mutual monitoring of fellow workers in the face-to- face laboratories. A sociology of scientific validity might recommend both increased opportunity for mutual monitoring in laboratories, and a restructuring of perceived legitimacy so that whistle-blowing (or an earlier-stage substitute for it) was not stigmatized as disloyalty or interpersonal hostility, but rather routinized as always required minority reports." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T.

> "Evolution, both cultural and biological, has produced organization-optimizing (group-solidarity) mechanisms which are optimal in intergroup conflict and hence work against whole-world organizational optimizing. LeVine and Campbell found that Sumner's principle, "the exigencies of war with outsiders are what make peace inside" or "real threat causes ingroup solidarity," was the most frequently endorsed or independently invented of all of the principles of intergroup conflict. If there is a "facultative polymorphism" for group vs. individual optimization, the threat of outgroup aggression is no doubt a powerful stimulus for group-optimizing behaviors. Such perceptions are open to manipulation by insecure national leaders and by their competitors for leadership, and such maneuvers are chronic saboteurs of intergroup peace. In proposing novel political arrangements, here is perhaps the greatest need for new arrangements and legitimacies. Perhaps the route could be through popular education as to these self-destructive mechanisms, plus a plausible design for world government which could offer the hope of righting injustices without war, plus a strong appeal to the motives of individual well-being and inclusive fitness done in such a manner as to not disrupt social coordination at sub-national levels of organization.

This applies over the whole spectrum, from the smallest units, families (that are strongly tied up by the genetically induced tendency to nepotism) and face-to-face groups (e.g. colleagues working in the same office space), to the largest (e.g. nations or groups of nations, such as the European Union, and the overarching religions or ideologies, such as the group of all Muslims). The fact that all these different fuzzily defined groups are nested or overlapping creates an extremely complicated picture, in which the same two individuals will either compete or cooperate, depending on the level at which their interaction takes places. This makes it extremely difficult to predict the further evolution of a complex society such as ours.

If beneficial beliefs thus manage to get shared world-wide, they may initialize a global pattern of cooperation. More specialized global control knowledge may similarly be developed and maintained within an overarching computer network (Heylighen, 1996), whose ubiquitousness, flexibility and intrinsic intelligence may be able to overcome the rigidities of bureaucratic organization and legal control, and the short-sightedness of market mechanisms. Nobody can predict how, when, or even whether, such global integration will take place. The only thing we can safely predict is that the various forces of individual and group selfishness will provide formidable obstacles, leading to major conflicts, on the road to world-wide cooperation." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)

> "A "social" MST can be seen as the emergence of an integrated, controlled supersystem out of similar, but initially independent control systems ("individuals"). It thus differs from others MST's discussed by Turchin, such as the emergence of movement, learning or rational thought, where the systems to be integrated (neurons, muscles, cognitive patterns, ...) either are not similar or are already dependent on an integrated organism. This difference is what makes social MST's problematic. We have seen that since individuals share common resources, yet independently maximize their outcomes, they tend to get engaged in negative sum competition. Positive sum, cooperative arrangements, which optimize the fitness of the group as a whole, normally get eroded by this competition. Thus, the part-whole competition between groups and individuals tends to be won by the individual level. A social metasystem would overcome this negative sum development by simultaneously differentiating individual's roles (division of labor), and restraining their selfish optimizing (social control), thus creating the conditions for positive sum synergy. However, a necessary condition for such metasystem to evolve is a shift from selection of individuals to selection of groups. We have discussed one mechanism that makes this possible: the development of controls (genetic or learned) that are shared between members of a group. Shared genetic controls are characteristic of the cells in an organism and the individual insects in an ant's nest or beehive. They thus may explain the well-integrated social metasystems found in multicellular organisms and insect societies.
>
> In human societies, on the other hand, competition at the genetic level continues, though group selection may have developed a genetic basis for certain innate social control mechanisms, like reciprocal altruism and moralistic aggression. This makes humans into profoundly ambivalent social animals. The predominant shared control for humans is cultural: beliefs spread through conformist transmission. However, the conformist mechanisms that keep beliefs similar are not sufficiently strong to keep context-dependence and communicative degradation from producing a continuous belief divergence or "memetic drift". Thus, human society becomes a patchwork of fuzzily defined groups at different levels of aggregation, characterized by clique selfishness and hostility towards competing groups. Different control mechanisms have evolved to complement the limited internalized restraint produced by shared beliefs: mutual monitoring, legal control and market mechanisms. However, each of these mechanisms has its intrinsic shortcomings, and as a whole they are characterized by inconsistency and lack of integration. Though there certainly exist methods and tools that may make social organization more effective, which must be examined urgently, we as yet do not see a straightforward path to social integration at the world level." - [Selection of Organization at the Social Level: obstacles and facilitators of metasystem transitions, by Francis Heylighen & Donald T. Campbell](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/SocialMST.pdf)






> "What if we could design our organizational systems to be optimally aligned with the deep structures of the mind and the principles of complexity theory?

> Imagine businesses, governments, and social initiatives that were explicitly modeled on the latest insights from neuroscience, complex systems theory, and evolutionary biology.

the internet as a stigmergic mediator
maybe just use the 3rd paragraph?

> "The remarkable efficiency of the Internet is at present still mostly physical or informational, not social. The Internet has grown so quickly that it has not had the time to evolve efficient institutions, i.e. collective systems of rules that coordinate individual actions. The result is a messy, confusing and constantly changing information landscape, that in principle offers immense benefits, but in practice only works reliably for a limited number of applications, while producing confusion, information overload, and various forms of “cybercrime”. As a result, an individual discovery published on the net may indeed change the world’s outlook within days, but the more likely outcome is that it will get buried within masses of other, mostly much less relevant information, and not receive the attention it deserves.
>
> In conclusion, the evolutionary dynamics underlying globalization has already led to a relatively efficient physical distribution of matter, energy and information across the globe, but still needs to produce the social institutions that go with it. This is not a very original observation: critics of the globalization of markets have pointed out that the extension of the free trade in goods and services needs to be counterbalanced by the further development of transnational institutions, such as UN, UNESCO, WHO, etc., to protect the rights of children, workers, consumers, cultural groups or the environment. The “stigmergic” theory proposed here, however, suggests a number of complementary mechanisms through which new types of institutions are likely to evolve.
>
> The main idea is that the external interaction medium, a role that is increasingly dominated by the Internet, will evolve into a mediator. This mediator will not only facilitate, but direct, and eventually control, interactions so as to maximize their synergy. To achieve that, the medium needs to develop a form of intelligent management of the communication processes it supports, leading to what may be called collective intelligence or distributed cognition. When this distributed intelligence spans the world, the resulting system may be called the Global Brain." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

this quote is just OK - not great
the entire internet as a stigmergic medium - the global brain

> "Agent swarms can perform not only the equivalent of intuitive, subconscious processes of activation spreading through the brain, but of systematic, logical search and deduction. To achieve that, the knowledge in the web needs to be organized according to a consensual ontology, i.e. a formal system of categories and relationships. Developing such ontologies is the goal of the Semantic Web project. Given such a semantic network, a software agent could be programmed with a “grammar” of rules that tell it to only explore or return certain categories of nodes and links. A swarm of such agents should for example be able to find all birds that do not fly, or the most representative researchers (as measured e.g. by PageRank or citation impact) who have written about globalization and evolution, cite publications of Modelski, work in one of the NATO countries and have a PhD, so that you can invite them to your NATO-sponsored workshop.
>
> In conclusion, quantitative stigmergy is able to turn the web from a passive medium for communication and storage of information into an intelligent mediator that uses learning and inference mechanisms similar to those of the human brain to recommend to its users the actions, information sources, or people most likely to be helpful for their aims. To achieve this, the intelligent web draws on the experience and knowledge of its users collectively, as externalized in the “trace” of preferences they leave on the paths they have traveled." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

connectivity, coordination, stigmergy, mediators, the internet & the global brain

> "Connectivity implies an increase in the number of agents one is interacting with, and therefore an increase in social complexity, with the concomitant threats of competition, conflict, and confusion. These problems too can be conceptualized most generally as a form of friction, i.e. the (generally unintended) obstruction of one agent’s actions by one or more other agents’ actions. As in the case of technological progress, the trial-and-error of evolution will tend to reduce this social friction by creating adapted institutions. Institutions, or more generally mediators, are systems that coordinate the activities of different agents so as to minimize friction and maximize synergy.
>
> A largely overlooked, but very powerful, mechanism for the spontaneous evolution of mediators is stigmergy, which relies on the medium or environment shared by the agents. Stigmergic interaction means that the change produced by one agent to the medium stimulates another agent to perform a complementary action, promoting their collective benefit even without any conscious intention to cooperate. Stigmergic activity will gradually reshape the passive medium into an active mediator, which elicits and directs the agents’ actions.
>
> The most “ephemeralized” example of the technological infrastructure underlying global connectivity is the Internet. A quick inspection shows that it provides a near ideal medium for stigmergic interaction: it instantaneously connects people all across the planet, is nearly always and everywhere available, can be used virtually without cost, is plastic enough to accommodate practically any “shape” or information that is imprinted upon it, while it will accurately register and store this information for as long as necessary. What it still lacks are the more evolved mediator functions. Yet, there already exist several examples of Internet services—such as the Google search engine or the Wikipedia website—that very successfully apply stigmergic principles to coordinate individual activities, thus offering their users a form of distributed intelligence well beyond the capabilities of a single individual.
>
> A straightforward extrapolation of this evolution that injects ever more intelligence into the Internet leads me to expect a near-term shift from World-Wide Web to Global Brain. The “Global Brain” is more than a fancy term for a large-scale intelligent system, though: the analogy runs much deeper. An analysis of the stigmergic mechanisms that seem most effective in supporting such distributed intelligence shows that they are virtually identical to the mechanisms used by the human brain. The quantitative stigmergy exemplified by “ant algorithms” is nearly identical to the process of Hebbian or reinforcement learning that differentially strengthens connections between neurons in the brain. The “ants” that trace and explore the quantitatively weighted network formed in this way correspond to human or software agents searching the web, or to bursts of activation spreading across the brain. Qualitative stigmergy, which is the true motor of innovation, can be seen as the basis of symbolic consciousness in the brain. It is exemplified on the web by a variety of collaborative, “open access” sites where people freely improve on each other’s contributions." - [Accelerating Socio-Technological Evolution: from ephemeralization and stigmergy to the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/AcceleratingEvolution.pdf)

## guided self-organization instead of imposed organization & central planning

> "If we zoom out and consider increasingly large distributed cognitive systems, we will notice that imposed organization plays an increasingly small role, while spontaneous networks become increasingly more important. The reason is simply that **the more complex the system, the more difficult it becomes to completely specify the rules about which component is to work with which other component in which way.** If we compare the poor results of central planning in communist societies with the effectiveness of the “invisible hand” of the market, then we can only conclude that self-organization must be the major driver of coordination in a system as complex as society.
>
> ... We must resign ourselves to the fact that we will never be able to fully control the process. Perhaps the most promising overall strategy is what has been called **“guided self-organization”: developing schemes, programs, institutions or environments that stimulate, facilitate and to some degree steer the self-organization of the global brain towards what appear to be the most fruitful directions, while leaving enough freedom for the system to explore a variety of unforeseen approaches.**" - [From human computation to the Global Brain: the self-organization of distributed intelligence, by Francis Heylighen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304113807_From_Human_Computation_to_the_Global_Brain_The_Self-Organization_of_Distributed_Intelligence)



## Noosphere

> "The noosphere is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the biogeochemist Vladimir Vernadsky, and philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Vernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary "sphere of reason". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, that of humankind's rational activities. The word is derived from the Greek νόος ("nous, mind, reason") and σφαῖρα ("sphere"), in lexical analogy to "atmosphere" and "biosphere"." - [Noosphere, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere)

> "For de Chardin, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds... As mankind organizes itself in more complex social networks, the higher the noosphere will grow in awareness. This concept extends Teilhard's Law of Complexity/Consciousness, the law describing the nature of evolution in the universe. Teilhard argued the noosphere is growing towards an even greater integration and unification, culminating in the Omega Point - an apex of thought/consciousness - which he saw as the goal of history." - [Noosphere, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere#:~:text=For%20de%20Chardin,goal%20of%20history.)

> "Noosphere: The noosphere refers to the layer of thought, mind or consciousness that envelops the Earth. This global "thinking circuit" emerged together with human culture and symbolic communication. These enabled the global spread, recombination and evolution of ideas, thus accelerating the production of new knowledge and insights. The noosphere is sometimes used as a synonym for the Global Superorganism, or at least its Global Brain." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

> "Noospheric consciousness: If the noosphere is interpreted as the brain of the global superorganism, then this brain is likely to be thinking at both a conscious and a subconscious level. The conscious level corresponds to issues that are openly debated, with different arguments pro and con being publicly considered before a collective decision is made. The subconscious level corresponds to automatic processes going on in the background, such as particular messages or posts being forwarded to certain people but not to others, without these people being aware of the algorithms making such decisions." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

<!--
paper is ok but not great - not sure if this should be included

> "The noosphere remains an underappreciated and understudied idea despite that it provides unique hope towards a positive and meaningful global integration. A core reason for this lack of attention is that its very definition is often unclear both in the West with Teilhard de Chardin and in the East with Vernadsky. I show how Living Systems Theory can clarify two fundamental meanings: the noosphere as a planetary superorganism and the noosphere as a sphere of mind, storing, processing and spreading information. I also present two key aspects to better grasp the concept: the noosphere as a planetary major evolutionary transition and the noosphere as the emergence of something radically new, which might include a planetary consciousness, or a planet seeking to find or contact other noospheres." - [What is the noosphere?

> "Superorganism: A superorganism is an organism that consists of component organisms. Examples are a multicellular organism that consists of cells, and an ant colony that consists of individual ants, yet behaves like a unified, single organism.
>
> Global superorganism (aka Metaman): Humanity as a whole can be conceived as a collective organism which consists of individual people, supported by their technological extensions. Like a biological organism, this social organism has a metabolism (or physiology), which converts raw materials into the energy and products needed to sustain its functioning. It also has a circulatory system, which transports these resources to where they are needed, and a nervous system, which processes and distributes information." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)


division of labor aka differentiation (specialization, efficiency) entails mutual dependence, integration and cooperation (lack of cheating & free riding)

> "Division of labor is based on the principle that if individuals specialize in carrying out particular tasks, they can be more efficient. However, if an individual is exclusively busy producing one particular type of commodity or service, then that individual will be dependent on reciprocation by others for providing the other resources (s)he needs. Therefore, division of labor can only evolve on a solid basis of cooperation. But once the process has started, division of labor will spontaneously increase, driven by a positive feedback mechanism, as illustrated by Gaines's (1994) computer simulation: individuals who were successful in providing a particular type of service—because of opportunity, competence or simply accident—will get more requests for that type of service, and thus get the chance to develop a growing expertise in the domain. This in turn will increase the demand for their specific service, stimulating them to further specialize...
>
> The increasing division of labor entails an accompanying increase in mutual dependence and therefore cooperativity. Cooperativity could be defined positively as probability or dependability of cooperation, and negatively as lack of cheating or free riding. This property of social systems is related to the concept of “social capital”. It is implicit in the legal system, the organization of the economy, and the unwritten rules which individuals follow in their interactions with others.
>
> ... The cooperativity of a society may be estimated by indicators such as level of corruption or crime (negative), and tolerance or trust in other people (positive). These have all significant correlations with the overall quality of life or development level of a nation... In conclusion we might hypothesize that the evolutionary development of a social system is generally accompanied by an extension of cooperativity, and thus of “organismic cohesion”.
>
> ... The increasing division of labor leads to a differentiation of the system into ever more specialized subunits. The increasing dependency of these units on the rest of the system, to compensate for the capacities they lost through specialization, leads to increasing integration and cohesion. Differentiation and integration together produce complexification of the global system, and an ever greater independence from the environment. The positive feedback relation between integration and differentiation leads to the accelerated development of a complex organization out of an aggregate of initially similar components. This is a metasystem transition: the evolutionary emergence of a higher level of cybernetic organization. This overall dynamic is at the base of both the evolution of multicellular organisms out of similar cells and of societies out of individuals." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

reducing friction through integration and interdependency, the implications (loss of stability, longer and more convoluted causal chains) and the need for better control mechanisms like a nervous system

> "In the longer term, gains in stability due to low-friction, negative feedback are likely to be maintained or amplified, while the loss of stability due to low-friction, positive feedbacks will increase the selective pressure for evolving new regulatory mechanisms. For example, the appearance of a circulatory system in multicellular organisms strongly reduced friction, making it much easier for nutrients and hormonal signals to travel through the body. This gave the organism better overall control over its dispersed tissues and organs, allowing it to become larger and more differentiated. The disadvantage was that microbes too could travel more efficiently. This was compensated by the evolution of white blood cells, allowing the immune functions to keep up with the flow. Similarly, the spread of computer viruses and other threats on the computer network might be stemmed by an artificial immune system, inspired by the mechanisms (such as self-other distinction) used by white blood cells to recognize intruders.
>
> More generally, the easier flow of goods, people and money in a globalizing society has led to new dangers, such as international crime syndicates, money laundering, and competition between countries that erodes wages, governments' capacities to collect taxes, and working standards. These can only be solved by the creation of global control mechanisms, such as transnational crime fighting agencies, rules for international bank transfers, and agreements on minimum social standards (e.g. restricting the import of goods made by child labor). The need to monitor and control such problems is at the base of the increasing importance of global institutions, such as WTO, IMF, World Bank, WHO, and UN. Thus, if short-term catastrophes can be avoided, reduction of friction will further enhance the robustness of societal autopoiesis.
>
> A more subtle effect of reduced friction is the lengthening of cause-and-effect chains. Imagine a row of billiard balls, each ball a short distance from the next one. If you hit the first ball with your cue (cause), it will hit the second ball (effect), which will itself hit the third ball (second effect), and so on. Because of friction, energy is lost, and each next ball will move more slowly than the previous one, until the point where the ball stops before it has reached the next one in line: the causal chain has broken. With lower friction, the chain will be longer.
>
> This same mechanism applies to our low friction society. In earlier periods, an event happening in one country would have little or no effect on events happening in another country. The chain of effects would have died down long before it would have reached the national border. Nowadays, the world as a whole has become interdependent. A poor harvest in one country will affect the production in another country, which will affect the stock market in a third country, which will affect the employment in yet another country, and so on. Each of these events will not just have one effect, but many, each of which will again influence many other events. The ongoing decrease of friction makes these interactions more numerous and more complex.
>
> Because of this ever greater interdependency, subsystems of the superorganism need to keep informed about an increasing number of events taking place in other subsystems. Longer causal chains mean that many more potential causes and effects need to be monitored, resulting in the concurrent dangers of unpreparedness—when relevant information is not available—and information overload—when the system is incapable to effectively interpret the available information. This augments the selective pressure to develop a more sophisticated capacity for the gathering and processing of information, and therefore to increase the efficiency of the superorganism's nervous system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

functional autonomy - control systems should delegate responsibility to subsystems - they only need to control whether the subsystems carry out their function without interfering with how that happens. The more autonomous subsystems are, the less hierarchical supervision they need

Aulin's (1982) law of requisite hierarchy: the required number of hierarchical levels decreases with increasing capacity for control in the subsystems

this leads to flattening of hierarchies into [heterarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy): networks of mutual influence without subordination

more on the interdependence

Superorganism stuff

TODO handle this big quote

> "The reason why outsourcing increases efficiency is the cybernetic principle of functional autonomy. In a complex control system, consisting of many interrelated subsystems performing a variety of tasks, the higher order system cannot oversee the activities of all of its subsystems, since, according to Ashby's (1964) law of requisite variety, its own variety (complexity) would need to be at least as great as the variety of all the subsystems combined. In order to minimize the complexity of its own decisionmaking, the control system should as much as possible delegate decision-making to the subsystems, that is, make them autonomously responsible for carrying out their function. The only thing that needs to be controlled is whether the subsystems carry out their function; how they carry it out is up to them. This defines functional autonomy.
>
> It is only when the subsystems are incapable of making the right decisions that the higher-order system must intervene and tell them what to do. This means that the more autonomous subsystems are, that is, the more control they have over the way they carry out their function, the less hierarchical supervision they need. This is the essence of Aulin's (1982) law of requisite hierarchy: the required number of hierarchical levels decreases with increasing capacity for control in the subsystems. Since friction decreases and overall efficiency and control increase in all components of society, this means that present organizations and society at large can function with a strongly reduced number of hierarchical levels, thus making perception and action much more efficient. This explains the present trend towards the flattening of hierarchies. The towering pyramids of hierarchical levels in traditional bureaucracies merely reflected the poor regulatory ability of the individuals and subsystems in such a bureaucracy (and the tendency to institutionalize an intricate pecking order).
>
> Hierarchies not only tend to flatten, but to turn into [heterarchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy), that is, networks of mutual influence without subordination...
>
> In conclusion, the improvement in communication, processing and control in all components of global society has a far-reaching impact on the structure of that society: the number of organizations performing the same function tends to decrease because of mergers and competitive exclusion, whereas the number of organizations performing different functions tends to increase, because of outsourcing, innovation, specialization and the discovery of new niches. At the same time, hierarchies are flattened or turned into heterarchies, and organizations become more autonomous in how they perform their functions, while becoming more dependent on society as a whole to determine which functions are in demand. Also, organizations become less dependent on specific individuals or geographic regions, and more defined by their activity or function.
>
> Thus, society increasingly resembles a complex organism, with its specialized cells, organs and tissues, that are functionally autonomous, but tightly integrated in a global, self-organizing network of mutually feeding processes. This is in clear contrast with the more traditional view of society as a bunch of essentially interchangeable individuals, groups and subgroups, separated by geographic distance or historic accident, that are jostling for power, while making temporary alliances. An important remaining difference is that cells in an organism tend to specialize early and irreversibly, whereas individuals and organizations in society remain able to switch from one function to another as demand or opportunities change, keeping the overall system very flexible." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

why the words "control" and "collective" don't imply a totalitarian, collectivist system, also the link between freedom and order

> "The most common objection to a superorganism model is that people tend to interpret it as a thinly disguised way of promoting a totalitarian, collectivist system. Especially the use of words such as “control” and “collective” evokes immediate associations with Stalinism and the brutal oppression of individual liberties. These negative connotations may be understandable, but they are wholly misdirected. The societal evolution I have sketched is mostly an extrapolation of existing trends, and these show an on-going increase in freedom, individualism, democracy and decentralization rather than a decrease. These trends can be explained straightforwardly by the postulated mechanisms of differentiation, which opens ever more possibilities for an individual to choose a role, education, or occupation, of reduced friction, which increases the general freedom of movement, of expression, and of consumption, and of increasing autonomy, which reduces the need to tightly control or monitor an individual's activities. The complementary mechanism of integration could be seen as a source of new constraints or limitations, but these are likely to restrict the freedom of powerful individuals—such as a Stalin-like dictator or a robber baron—and organizations to abuse the system for their own ends, rather than the freedom of ordinary people to realize their individual ambitions. Global integration means an increasing mutual dependency of various organizations, and therefore an increasing difficulty for any one organization to dominate the others. This is understandably resented by those who have most power to lose, but should be welcomed by the less powerful.
>
> ... Insofar that totalitarian societies were based on an ideological or political system, such as Soviet communism, this system was very different from the self-organizing, cybernetic, “organism-like” system that this paper proposes. As discussed by the cybernetician and Soviet dissident Valentin Turchin, the Soviet system lacked the most crucial component of cybernetic control: feedback. Instead of a distributed feedback loop, constantly adapting to the changing circumstances, the Soviet economy was based on a rigid, mechanical, top-down command structure, with little regard for the effect of those commands in the real world. This led to the well-known “calculation problem”, where the central planning agency would find it impossible to determine exactly how many shoes would need to be produced to satisfy the needs of a given population. The resulting economic inefficiency contributed to the eventual collapse of the Soviet system." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

how more differentiation and integration lead to more freedom of movement, communication and occupation as long as the necessary constraints are in place

> "The common idea that what you lose in comfort by dropping out, you gain in freedom, is based on a misunderstanding of what “freedom” means. Without technology and social support systems, life is basically a struggle for survival, where most energy and time must be directed towards finding the necessary food and shelter. By removing these requirements, society has given us the real freedom of doing what we want, where we want it, and (most of the time) when we want it, without having to worry whether we will be able to survive. Especially technology, such as the transport and communication systems, has enormously expanded our freedom of movement and of communication. The more the superorganism increases its differentiation and integration, the more options we will have to choose our occupation, or go wherever we want whenever we want. Of course, belonging to an encompassing system does impose certain constraints, aimed at maximizing the synergy between interacting components and minimizing mutual obstruction. However, such constraints do not generally reduce overall freedom. This may be illustrated by the traffic code. Being able to travel with your car wherever you want is a great freedom, which people from previous ages could hardly even imagine. However, for many people to drive safely and with a minimum of interference on the same roads, traffic rules must be followed." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

why most (all?) roads lead to integration at the global level as a single superorganism

> "The possibility seems real that some groups or countries will effectively want to remain outside the emerging global society. It is also conceivable that different federations of countries will be formed, each following their own set of rules, while minimizing exchanges with each other. This happened to some degree during the Cold War when capitalist countries were politically and ideologically separated from the communist block. At the moment, the more important divisions perhaps oppose developed countries and developing nations, or countries with a Christian tradition and countries with an Islamic tradition. A deepening of such divisions could in principle lead to the creation of separate, competing superorganisms.
>
> Yet, there are several reasons why this scenario appears unlikely. The first reason is similar to the reason why individual drop-outs are rare. A country that would decide to leave the international community with its systems and rules, would immediately lose a great many benefits: resources, products, services, information, new technologies, solidarity, etc. This would significantly slow down or even reverse its development compared to other countries. This can be illustrated by the fate of “pariah” states, like Iraq, North Korea, or Albania before the fall of communism. Such growing backwardness would provide an increasingly strong incentive for the regime to change its policies.
>
> The negative effects of disconnecting from the rest of the world could be mitigated if a large number countries would “drop out” together, forming a rival block. However, the Cold War has shown that two competing blocks, even if they seem roughly matched in size, resources or military power, are unlikely to remain at the same level of development. Because economic and technological progress is an ever accelerating, exponential process, small differences in initial conditions or speed of development will lead to increasing gaps, until it becomes clear for everybody that the one block is more successful than the other one. This will put increasing pressure on the less successful block to open up towards the more successful one, in order to assimilate its successes.
>
> A second reason why a splitting up of the superorganism seems unlikely is the homogenizing effect of global communication on preferences and standards. If people have to choose between competing, but similarly valuable, alternatives, they tend to choose the one they encounter most often. This reinforces the lead of the most common one, in a positive feedback loop (the “law of increasing returns”) that quickly drives out all alternatives but one (“lock-in”). In a situation where communication between groups is limited, this may lead to different standards in different groups, but in an era of fast, global communication, all groups will tend to converge on a single standard in a rather short time." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

concluding remarks on the superorganism

> "Since society is an organismic system consisting of organisms (individual people), it can be viewed as a “superorganism”. Conspicuous trends such as globalization, automation, and the rise of computer networks can be understood as aspects of the general evolution towards increasing efficiency and interconnectedness which makes the superorganism ever more robust. In particular, increasing efficiency explains the growing economic productivity and the decrease of friction, which facilitates all material and informational exchanges. The accompanying differentiation and integration explain the seemingly opposite trends towards outsourcing and mergers, and the growing importance of supranational rules, standards and institutions. Increasing efficiency of communication and control moreover explains the increasing functional autonomy of components (individuals or organizations), and the concurrent flattening of hierarchies and rise of heterarchies.
>
> Although the effects of these trends are mostly positive, for both individuals and society as a whole, some of the side-effects can be detrimental. Reduced friction in particular increases the risk that positive feedback processes would get out of control. It also leads to increasingly complex causal chains of interconnected events, augmenting the need for information gathering and processing. Controlling these dangers requires a strengthening of the superorganism's nervous system. This control system has both centralized and distributed components. Centralization is exemplified by the growing importance of global institutions, responsible for the formulation and implementation of international standards, rules and laws.
>
> Distributed control can be exemplified by the “invisible hand” that mutually adjusts supply and demand. Its effectiveness is boosted by the emerging global computer network. The increasing reach, capacity, and intelligence of this network allow it to automate more and more functions of the superorganism's nervous system. This will transform the World-Wide Web into a “global brain”, capable of sensing, interpreting, learning, thinking, deciding, and initiating actions. Individuals are likely to become more and more intimately connected to this intelligent network, through ubiquitous, intuitive interfaces, and eventually a direct brain-to-web connection." - [The Global Superorganism: an evolutionary-cybernetic model of the emerging network society, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/Superorganism.pdf)

We can use LLMs to annotate long-form media and link to all the claims

LLMs can help craft a propositional claim with structured data
^^ THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR HURDLE FOR THE ADOPTION OF A SEMANTIC WEB - THE INACCESIBILITY for normal people to express themselves in such a way and to consume such data. LLMs fix this.

We can have approved LLMs for tagging data and use zk-ml to prove that the specific model was used
ZK-ML alternatives: optimistic fraud proofs & cryptoeconomics
https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/dont-trust-verify-an-overview-of-decentralized-inference-c471a9f7a586

how do we express "I don't want fast food in my neightbourhood"?
What if you could ask an LLM "what does my neightbourhood want to change?"

Use LLMs to contribute annotations and structured data and use LLMs to speak back at you what the aggregate thinks

LLMs will be the global brain interpreters and narrators

We could have a specialized LLM trained specifically to "talk" in the language of this system (construct structured data with the right ontologies)

We can use LLMs to generate the headlines/summaries to combat clickbait

LLMs are the gate/bridge to structure, aggregation, and integration

imagine talking with the aggregate sentiment and knowledge of the world with the help of an LLM and exploring humanity in real time through any lens you wish - not with some pre-trained model without a clue how the sausage was made

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

# SECTION: Fragmentation vs. Integration
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "Collective intelligence is a natural property of socially shared cognition, a natural enabler of collaboration. But there are also natural forces that challenge collective intelligence, forces that doom projects and make collaboration difficult or impossible. These are forces of fragmentation.
>
> The concept of fragmentation provides a name and an image for a phenomenon that pulls apart something which is potentially whole. Fragmentation suggests a condition in which the people involved see themselves as more separate than united, and in which information and knowledge are chaotic and scattered. The fragmented pieces are, in essence, the perspectives, understandings, and intentions of the collaborators. Fragmentation, for example, is when the stakeholders in a project are all convinced that their version of the problem is correct. Fragmentation can be hidden, as when stakeholders don’t even realize that there are incompatible tacit assumptions about the problem, and each believes that his or her understandings are complete and shared by all. The antidote to fragmentation is shared understanding and shared commitment." - [Wicked Problems & Social Complexity, by Jeff Conklin](https://cognexus.org/wpf/wickedproblems.pdf)

> "The antidote for fragmentation is coherence. How, then, do we create coherence? In organizations and project teams – in situations where collaboration is the life blood of success – coherence amounts to shared understanding and shared commitment. Shared understanding of meaning and context, and of the dimensions and issues in the problem. Shared commitment to the processes of project work and to the emergent solution matrix. Coherence means that stakeholders have shared meaning for key terms and concepts, that they are clear about their role in the effort, that together they have a shared understanding of the background for the project and what the issues are, and that they have a shared commitment to how the project will reach its objectives and achieve success. Coherence means that the project team understands and is aligned with the goals of the project and how to reach them. Coherence means that a wicked problem is recognized as such, and appropriate tools and processes are constantly used to ‘defragment’ the project. With increased coherence, more collective intelligence becomes available to deal with change and complexity." - [Wicked Problems & Social Complexity, by Jeff Conklin](https://cognexus.org/wpf/wickedproblems.pdf)

> Best practices for media to avoid frame control include: **Show as much data as you can that is relevant; orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed; know when fact checking is not enough; clarify what is important and why to justify focus; share multiple frames; acknowledge what is not known and where there is no basis for certainty; argue counter narratives and share facts that seem to support an alternative hypothesis**" - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Frame%20control%20is,an%20alternative%20hypothesis)

> "**Competing unverifiable claims result in a situation of narrative deadlock in which irreconcilable views become entrenched.** There is no way out of deadlock until the competing narratives can be broken down into potentially verifiable elements, which can then become a focus of investigation by both parties. Absent an earnest assessment of the veracity of claims there is no way to resolve a dispute, and so the tactic of engagement often reverts into frame control rather than analysis and argumentation. Where the situation is such that we cannot verify or falsify key elements, then all parties should hold tentative beliefs with low enough confidence to not start “wars” over them. The ability to hold beliefs tentatively is important also for any person or group seeking to avoid confirmation bias." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Competing%20unverifiable%20claims,avoid%20confirmation%20bias.)

> "To avoid being captured by polarization there must be awareness of the negative impacts of the dynamic, as well as the means by which it takes effect. Polarization involves not doing synthesis; it means being wrong or at least problematically partial. Polarization dynamics also result in orienting towards “war” rather than coordination. The dynamics sometimes stem from actual, explicit political alliances, but almost always involve appealing to the biases and emotions of an in-group against an out-group. The speed bias forcing sloppy work, as soundbites force a narrowing of perspectives and advertising revenues demand more clicks and longer times on page, reinforces polarization." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=To%20avoid%20being,page%2C%20reinforces%20polarization.)

> "It is possible to act in ways that decrease polarization. The media should explicitly differentiate, gauge, and discuss the plausibility of claims when presenting them. As complexity and polarization increases it becomes more important to show as much data as you can that is relevant, to orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed, and to know when fact-checking is not enough. When narrowing focus, clarify what is important and essential to know, justify and explain why one story is being told rather than another. Polarization decreases to the extent that public culture is characterized by intelligent voices that are earnestly seeking out and articulating the views of all relevant groups as part of leading to understanding." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=it%20is%20possible,leading%20to%20understanding.)
