> "The brain has hundreds of bugs, which we call [cognitive biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). But you can classify them as a bunch of fun little bugs and one monster: confirmation bias. It’s the tendency to quickly adopt new information that supports your beliefs and to quickly discount the new information that undermines them. This is among the biggest hindrances to human development, since it’s so hard to correct people’s erroneous beliefs, and so our society carries them forward for ages." - [How to Change Beliefs, by Tomas Pueyo](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/how-to-change-beliefs#:~:text=The%20brain%20has,forward%20for%20ages.)

> "Now what we know unfortunately as true is that that intelligence - while so impressive - is only very weakly predictive of rationality. You take all the standard measures for intelligence - they all strongly predict each other - you take standard measures for rationality - this is the work of Stanovich and others - they all strongly predict each other, so two strong positive manifolds, but the measure for general intelligence and the measure for general rationality are only correlated at 0.3. Intelligence is necessary but nowhere near sufficient for rationality. Why is that? Because think about what I said: you're intelligent by ignoring most of the information. Remember my example of your interaction with the woman: sometimes the information you ignore is exactly the information you need to solve your problem. You realize that in a moment of insight, but the opposite is also constantly possible for you - you don't realize, you don't realize that you've misframed the situation - you're finding the wrong things salient you and therefore you're judging the wrong things to be relevant or important. And we live in a world that is exacerbating that - Harry Frankfurt called that bullshit and I don't mean to be offensive - that's the term of his famous essay. The liar cares about your concern for the truth and tells you something and tries to get you to believe it to be true because of your commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist does something different - they try to make something salient to you and have you not care about whether it's true or false - all advertising works this way." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1390)

> "Across time, history, culture, environment - you see people coming up with sets of practices for ameliorating that self-deception and enhancing that cognitive fittedness. The name that's most usually used for those practices is wisdom. See, knowledge deals with ignorance, but wisdom deals with foolishness and those are not the same thing - you can be very intelligent and very foolish and there is no contradiction there at all." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1567)

> "We bashed out a consensus paper about what we think are the important features in wisdom. The dominant feature is perspectival metacognition. What does that mean? This is the ability to take multiple perspectives, to be able to shift perspectives. Shifting perspectives is one of the most powerful ways - I'm using my glasses like my mental frame - to get out of my mental framing. When I'm in a perspective what I typically can't see is the way the perspective is biasing me - I can't also take on interests and goals that are outside my perspective. But if I can take on his perspective or his perspective - that I can then look through them back on my perspective - I can actually overcome misframing. We depend on the dialogue between us to generate the multi-perspectival ability that can enhance the collective intelligence towards collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1621)

> "You can see the myths as enacting relevance realization on the collective intelligence of distributed cognition trying to educate us into wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1866)

> "I'm proposing to you that we should understand democracy as opponent processing within the collective intelligence of distributed cognition that is trying to self-organize that collective intelligence into a more proper orientation to the World." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1900)

> "But there are ways in which the collective intelligence can be subject to self-organizing foolishness - the bullshit can overwhelm us. And are we not now in a world in which the bullshit is overwhelming us more and more and more? How can the opponent processing of democracy degenerate? Well it can break down into polarization in which the emphasis on differentiation overtakes the opponent processing, or it can break down in group think, in echo chambers and bubbles that over emphasize the integration. We lose the complexification that allows us to deal with the complexity of the world and we stupefy ourselves into a kind of collective foolishness. When you have polarization the opponent processing breaks down into adversarial processing: one side is trying to destroy at all costs the other. And the problem with this of course is that debate depends on shared orientation - if we do not have a shared normativity we can't engage in debate. Groupthink also destroys the opponent processing because it reduces the multi-perspectival nature that is needed for collective wisdom - we're all thinking from the same perspective, we all have the same orientation. So either we don't have any orientation or we all have exactly the same one and the whole machinery breaks down." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=1925)

> "I've been arguing at length that the West - whatever that is supposed to point to ultimately - is suffering from a meaning crisis or another way of understanding it is a wisdom famine. I will ask my students "Where do you go for information?" - they hold up the phone. "Where do you go for knowledge?" - science, the university. "Where do you go for wisdom?" - deafening silence. deadly silence. If our democracy is not educating us towards wisdom and alleviating the meaning crisis by understanding the embodied, enacted, embedded, extended nature of our cognition - it will not survive, because the meaning crisis - the wisdom famine - will overwhelm it. Debate presupposes a common unity, a community. It presupposes distributed cognition running collective intelligence that's being educated towards the wisdom of enhancing our connectedness, our meaning in the world. Without that, what we have is degenerate adversarial processing or echo chambering that is not addressing but in fact exacerbating the meaning crisis and the wisdom famine within propositional tyranny so all we have is endemic endless ideological warfare and the tsunami of bullshit that it generates. What is needed is a way of accessing collective intelligence and transforming it into collective wisdom." - [John Vervaeke: Democracy and the Relevance Realization of Distributed Cognition](https://youtu.be/8U2caURO-d4?t=2272)


> "In giving humans reason at all, evolution took a huge risk. Surely it must have wished there was some other way, some path that made us big-brained enough to understand tradition, but not big-brained enough to question it. Maybe it searched for a mind design like that and couldn’t find one. So it was left with this ticking time-bomb, this ape that was constantly going to be able to convince itself of hare-brained and probably-fatal ideas." - [Book review: The Secret of Our Success, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/#:~:text=In%20giving%20humans,probably%2Dfatal%20ideas.)

> "There’s a monster at the end of this book. Humans evolved to transmit culture with high fidelity. And one of the biggest threats to transmitting culture with high fidelity was Reason. Our ancestors lived in Epistemic Hell, where they had to constantly rely on causally opaque processes with justifications that couldn’t possibly be true, and if they ever questioned them then they might die. Historically, Reason has been the villain of the human narrative, a corrosive force that tempts people away from adaptive behavior towards choices that “sounded good at the time”.

> "What reason does, rather, is help us justify our beliefs and actions to others, convince them through argumentation, and evaluate the justifications and arguments that others address to us. In other words, reason helps humans better exploit their uniquely rich social environment. This interactionist interpretation explains why reason may have evolved and how it fits with other cognitive mechanisms. It makes sense of strengths and weaknesses that have long puzzled philosophers and psychologists―why reason is biased in favor of what we already believe, why it may lead to terrible ideas and yet is indispensable to spreading good ones." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32336635-the-enigma-of-reason?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=KRXjn7mFzN&rank=1#:~:text=What%20reason%20does,spreading%20good%20ones.)

> "Reason is flawed, but how badly? How should success or failure in reasoning be assessed? What are the mechanisms responsible? In spite of their often bitter disagreements, parties to these polemics have failed to question a basic dogma. All have taken for granted that the job of reasoning is to help individuals achieve greater knowledge and make better decisions. If you accept the dogma, then, yes, it is quite puzzling that reason should fall short of being impartial, objective, and logical. It is paradoxical that, quite commonly, reasoning should fail to bring people to agree and, even worse, that it should often exacerbate their differences. But why accept the dogma in the first place?" - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027487-reason-is-flawed-but-how-badly-how-should-success-or)

> "Whereas reason is commonly viewed as the use of logic, or at least some system of rules to expand and improve our knowledge and our decisions, we argue that reason is much more opportunistic and eclectic and is not bound to formal norms. The main role of logic in reasoning, we suggest, may well be a rhetorical one: logic helps simplify and schematize intuitive arguments, highlighting and often exaggerating their force. So, why did reason evolve? What does it provide, over and above what is provided by more ordinary forms of inference, that could have been of special value to humans and to humans alone? To answer, we adopt a much broader perspective. Reason, we argue, has two main functions: that of producing reasons for justifying oneself, and that of producing arguments to convince others. These two functions rely on the same kinds of reasons and are closely related." - [The Enigma of Reason](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9027493-whereas-reason-is-commonly-viewed-as-the-use-of-logic)


> "Sperber and Mercier see reason as an evolved module within the brain which specializes in producing reasons for our behavior. These reasons serve to justify our behavior to ourselves and others. It also enables us to evaluate the reasons proposed by others for their behavior. As such, it serves a primarily social role, one of coordination and cooperation, rather than an intellectual one of abstract problem solving... For Sperber and Mercier, what is important is that there is nothing unique about reason per-se, it simply operates on meta-level representations rather than low level primitives as most other inference mechanisms such as visual perception do.
>
> The authors propose that reason leads us astray in the pursuit of objective knowledge not because it is flawed, but because that is simply not what it evolved to do in the first place... Rather than reflecting some sort of transcendent capacity for pure abstract logic, human reason is often messy, and relies more on context and perceived relevance rather than stone-cold rules of logical deduction. Chief among these is the so-called myside bias (a generalization of confirmation bias), where humans produce reasons which reinforce their previously held beliefs. The myside bias ironically often leads people to become more wrong after thinking deeply about a problem than if they had to make a decision on the spur of the moment.
>
> ... If the hypothesis put forward by Sperber and Mercier is correct though, human reason isn’t even for problem solving, let alone for some hypothetical context-agnostic problem solving. Rather, it is for justification and explanation of behavior and decisions reached implicitly within an embodied social context. In this view, the so-called flaws in human reasoning which a superhuman intelligence would supposedly correct for are not even flaws, but rather the features of the mechanism working as they evolved to...
>
> All hope is not lost however, as the authors do discuss the conditions within which reason does in fact aid in the obtaining of objective truth or knowledge, and those are primarily social. For Sperber and Mercier, it is when reason is placed within its proper context, and humans are forced to justify and explain themselves to others, that reason does more than simply serve a social function. This is because critically, humans are better at evaluating reasons than we are at producing them. As a result, the bias towards producing reasons which justify our implicit decisions and the ability of others to find flaws in our reasons end up working together. These two abilities make possible open argumentation and debate to produce reasons which are better tuned to reality, and can thus ultimately drive better problem solving in the future." - [Thoughts on “The Enigma of Reason”, by Arthur Juliani](https://awjuliani.medium.com/thoughts-on-the-enigma-of-reason-11983c90cb75)

> "UTOK's [Justification Systems Theory](https://www.unifiedtheoryofknowledge.org/8-key-ideas/justification-systems-theory) posits that there was an important tipping point in human evolution when our ancestors started talking in sentences. Sentences, in the form of propositions, carry meanings that can be questioned. This “question-answer dynamic” reinforces the process by which humans form networks of beliefs and values. UTOK calls these networks “justification systems” because they link together to develop a coordinated sense among people of what is and what ought to be the case. As such, they provide the structure for legitimizing how people think about the world and how they should behave." - [Religion: Why We Need to Regain a Mythos, by Gregg Henriques](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/theory-of-knowledge/202403/religion-why-we-need-to-regain-a-mythos#:~:text=UTOK%27s%20Justification%20Systems,they%20should%20behave.)

And in some complex chaotic systems we might even understand the dynamics and trends and yet we might not be able to predict. And yet, being able to predict is a useful signal for competence/understanding and in the cases when it's impossible - that's why we also be rating (good - a.k.a. hard to vary - all the parts of it should serve a purpose such that none of them are arbitrary and if any one of them is changed that would break the explanation - see The Beginning Of Infinity) explanations. Also if someone got some prediction right but their explanation is obviously (to us) wrong we might rule out their prediction in our subjective evaluation of their performance - we can simply discard it and not give them any credit.

we can even give more weight to recent successful predictions and discount the earliest ones - when someone was still learning to think probabilistically and knew little about the world

Prediction markets are not necessarily for telling you what's true - they're for separating the winners from the losers. A constant influx of new entrants enables the aggregate to be skewed. We can have something like prediction markets that are non-financial but tied around identity

on prediction markets...
Involving money & futures contracts on any outcome might put skin in the game but has proven controversial (especially when it comes to terrorist attacks & assassinations):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrade
We can reward with reputation/status/influence - not money. Also we can have prediction markets and simply vote which topics would be covered and which would not.
Involving money requires fixing the oracle problem - we can avoid that and simply choose fact databases and decide how to calculate reputation.
Financial contracts might probably also require syncing with these folks:
Not using financial futures contracts avoids problems and dealings with these folks:

<!-- QUOTES THAT SHOULD PROBABLY STAY HIDDEN:

> "The brain is a multi-layer prediction machine. All neural processing consists of two streams: a bottom-up stream of sense data, and a top-down stream of predictions. These streams interface at each level of processing, comparing themselves to each other and adjusting themselves as necessary.
>
> The bottom-up stream starts out as all that incomprehensible light and darkness and noise that we need to process. It gradually moves up all the cognitive layers that we already knew existed – the edge-detectors that resolve it into edges, the object-detectors that shape the edges into solid objects, et cetera.
>
> The top-down stream starts with everything you know about the world, all your best heuristics, all your priors, everything that’s ever happened to you before – everything from “solid objects can’t pass through one another” to “e=mc^2” to “that guy in the blue uniform is probably a policeman”. It uses its knowledge of concepts to make predictions – not in the form of verbal statements, but in the form of expected sense data. It makes some guesses about what you’re going to see, hear, and feel next, and asks “Like this?” These predictions gradually move down all the cognitive layers to generate lower-level predictions. If that uniformed guy was a policeman, how would that affect the various objects in the scene? Given the answer to that question, how would it affect the distribution of edges in the scene? Given the answer to that question, how would it affect the raw-sense data received?
>
> Both streams are probabilistic in nature. The bottom-up sensory stream has to deal with fog, static, darkness, and neural noise; it knows that whatever forms it tries to extract from this signal might or might not be real. For its part, the top-down predictive stream knows that predicting the future is inherently difficult and its models are often flawed. So both streams contain not only data but estimates of the precision of that data. A bottom-up percept of an elephant right in front of you on a clear day might be labelled “very high precision”; one of a a vague form in a swirling mist far away might be labelled “very low precision”. A top-down prediction that water will be wet might be labelled “very high precision”; one that the stock market will go up might be labelled “very low precision”.
>
> As these two streams move through the brain side-by-side, they continually interface with each other. Each level receives the predictions from the level above it and the sense data from the level below it. Then each level uses Bayes’ Theorem to integrate these two sources of probabilistic evidence as best it can. This can end up a couple of different ways.
>
> First, the sense data and predictions may more-or-less match. In this case, the layer stays quiet, indicating “all is well”, and the higher layers never even hear about it. The higher levels just keep predicting whatever they were predicting before.
>
> Second, low-precision sense data might contradict high-precision predictions. The Bayesian math will conclude that the predictions are still probably right, but the sense data are wrong. The lower levels will “cook the books” – rewrite the sense data to make it look as predicted – and then continue to be quiet and signal that all is well. The higher levels continue to stick to their predictions.
>
> Third, there might be some unresolvable conflict between high-precision sense-data and predictions. The Bayesian math will indicate that the predictions are probably wrong. The neurons involved will fire, indicating “surprisal” – a gratuitiously-technical neuroscience term for surprise. The higher the degree of mismatch, and the higher the supposed precision of the data that led to the mismatch, the more surprisal – and the louder the alarm sent to the higher levels.
>
> When the higher levels receive the alarms from the lower levels, this is their equivalent of bottom-up sense-data. They ask themselves: “Did the even-higher-levels predict this would happen?” If so, they themselves stay quiet. If not, they might try to change their own models that map higher-level predictions to lower-level sense data. Or they might try to cook the books themselves to smooth over the discrepancy. If none of this works, they send alarms to the even-higher-levels.
>
> All the levels really hate hearing alarms. Their goal is to minimize surprisal – to become so good at predicting the world (conditional on the predictions sent by higher levels) that nothing ever surprises them. Surprise prompts a frenzy of activity adjusting the parameters of models – or deploying new models – until the surprise stops.
>
> All of this happens several times a second. The lower levels constantly shoot sense data at the upper levels, which constantly adjust their hypotheses and shoot them down at the lower levels. When surprise is registered, the relevant levels change their hypotheses or pass the buck upwards. After umpteen zillion cycles, everyone has the right hypotheses, nobody is surprised by anything, and the brain rests and moves on to the next task. As per the book:
>
> "To deal rapidly and fluently with an uncertain and noisy world, brains like ours have become masters of prediction – surfing the waves and noisy and ambiguous sensory stimulation by, in effect, trying to stay just ahead of them. A skilled surfer stays ‘in the pocket’: close to, yet just ahead of the place where the wave is breaking. This provides power and, when the wave breaks, it does not catch her. The brain’s task is not dissimilar. By constantly attempting to predict the incoming sensory signal we become able – in ways we shall soon explore in detail – to learn about the world around us and to engage that world in thought and action."
>
> The result is perception, which the PP theory describes as “controlled hallucination”. You’re not seeing the world as it is, exactly. You’re seeing your predictions about the world, cashed out as expected sensations, then shaped/constrained by the actual sense data." - [Book Review: Surfing Uncertainty, by Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/#:~:text=the%20brain%20is,actual%20sense%20data.)

> "The free energy principle might be the most all-encompassing idea since the theory of natural selection." - [Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=Karl%20Friston%E2%80%99s%20free%20energy%20principle%20might%20be%20the%20most%20all%2Dencompassing%20idea%20since%20the%20theory%20of%20natural%20selection)

> "The free energy principle is a theoretical framework suggesting that the brain reduces surprise or uncertainty by making predictions based on internal models and updating them using sensory input. It highlights the brain's objective of aligning its internal model and the external world to enhance prediction accuracy. This principle integrates Bayesian inference with active inference, where actions are guided by predictions and sensory feedback refines them. It has wide-ranging implications for comprehending brain function, perception, and action." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle#:~:text=The%20free%20energy,and%20action.)

> "The FEP states that living organisms are dynamical systems that are separated from their environment by an interface. We will refer to these living organisms as ‘agents’ for the sake of convenience going forward, since all living organisms sense their environment and act in response to those sensations... Crucially, this interface separates both the environment from the agent and the agent from its surroundings, allowing it to exist as a self-contained and autonomous entity. Agents therefore always necessarily receive sensory information and act through this interface. They never have unmediated access to what is going on in the environment, and as a result always have to guess (or infer) what is the true state of the world based on the information they have access to. According to the FEP, all agents act, as best as they can, to minimize the errors in their guesses about the environment. These errors can be quantified by a metric called ‘free energy,’ and the better an agent can minimize it over time, the better chance the agent has of staying alive and maintaining itself. To understand it intuitively, think of free energy as a measure of surprise or uncertainty." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "The minimization of free energy is not an end in itself. It is ultimately in service of the maintenance of the agent as an individual separated from its environment. Agents do this by attempting to remain in a state of homeostasis. All living agents have some sense of what that homeostasis for them should be, even if it is only represented implicitly within the structure of the agent itself. In the same way that sensory prediction errors increase free energy, so do deviations from the desired homeostasis of the agent, as the homeostatic set points of an agent itself are another kind of prediction about the world." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "An interesting aspect of the FEP is that it can often produce behavior which paradoxically doesn’t seem like error minimization, at least in the short-term. Let’s imagine that someone moves to a new neighborhood they are unfamiliar with. They could choose to stay inside their new home, which would indeed allow them to minimize any prediction errors that would arise from the novel environment. On the other hand, they could go outside and explore their new surroundings. Doing the latter will produce many more short-term prediction errors. In the long run though it will allow them to avoid even bigger surprises in the future. It is this dynamic of long-term free energy minimization that can account for various forms of exploration, adventure, and industry which we are motivated to engage in." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)

> "We humans distinguish ourselves from other living agents by our ability to not only react to the environment but also establish goals and then set out to accomplish them. This might seem to be a challenge for a theory which suggests that all behavior is in the service of entropy minimization, but the FEP accounts for this quite elegantly as well. In this view, when we set a goal for ourselves, we are making a special kind of prediction about the world. This prediction is one that we know goes against the current sensory evidence, thus increasing free energy. Instead of updating our beliefs to account for the world (and in essence give up on the goal), what we do instead is to set out to act in the world in order to ensure that the sensory evidence corresponds to our prediction, and minimize the free energy in the process... We make a prediction about how we would like the world to be, and then act in order to make that prediction come true." - [A Gentle Introduction to the Free Energy Principle](https://awjuliani.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-free-energy-principle-03f219853177)


> "The free energy principle is a law of life that emerged from Karl Friston’s “Bayesian brain hypothesis,” but it applies to brainless organisms as well. In fact, it presumably applies to every complex adaptive system in nature, societies included. The free energy principle is a framework for understanding how self-organized systems maintain themselves in a world that abides by the second law. Here we will focus on its applications for humans.
>
> The principle proposes that the brain is an organ that is designed to reduce uncertainty about the world around us and make predictions about future events. This is accomplished by generating internal predictions and comparing them to incoming sensory information. The brain then uses this comparison to update the beliefs of its model. In other words, the free energy principle suggests that the brain is constantly trying to minimize the difference between its internal model and reality. When the brain receives new information that contradicts its predictions, it experiences a state of "free energy" which drives it to update its beliefs and reduce its ignorance. To be clear, this is not thermodynamic free energy, but information-theoretic free energy, a term used in the field of machine learning. Performing this function allows us to make more accurate predictions, and makes us better adapted to nature." - [Introducing Three of the Teleological Stance's Tools for Self-Optimization and Self-Actualization, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/introducing-three-of-the-teleological#:~:text=The%20free%20energy%20principle%20is,us%20better%20adapted%20to%20nature.)

> "What is active inference? It’s a theory that describes how self-organizing biological systems maintain internal order by minimizing uncertainty about the world. Think of living systems as “bubbles of order” actively & dynamically persisting in the face of entropy, the natural tendency to disorder. This is represented by a “Markov blanket” - a statistical formalism for “identity” that partitions internal and external states. Internal order is maintained through exchanges of information between internal states, beliefs in a world model, and external states, the raw environment beyond immediate perception. This intermediation occurs via two “blanket” states: sensory states, the subset of external states that are perceived, and active states that represent actions taken to alter external states and thus sensory states.

So, these cows get sick very easily. And so what happens? The cattlemen have to give the cows shots of antibiotics. So, virtually all of the CAFO-treated meat that we consume in this country is all antibiotic laden. So, what are those antibiotics doing? Does that carry over into our gut microbiome and disrupt it? Absolutely. And it disrupts the cow's microbiome. So, it kills off the good beneficial bacteria in the cow's microbiome and allows the methanogens, the methane-producing bacteria to basically take over. So, each cow today is making six times the methane than they did in 1968." - [Robert Lustig](https://youtu.be/onVqjZOYlQs?t=3599)

But the debate on Twitter is very linear: all the responses to a tweet are nested into the first tweet, ranked mostly by recency, which doesn’t invite for thoughtful conversation, but rather fast conversation. You can’t have thoughtful and fast conversations at the same time, so conversations on Twitter tend to quickly descend into chaos.

For Retweets, you want soundbites that people feel good about endorsing with their own identity. That is great to spur identity politics, for example. Lots of Responses also get your tweet distribution: another way to incentivize debate and polarization. Getting only likes is the weakest of the 3. Meanwhile, Likes don’t get you as much distribution. But Likes are by far the thing that people do most when they want to show compassion, for example.

our current systems optimize for efficiency (attention capture) - not the evolvability of ideas
the host-centric model hinders our ability to develop the tools for integration - for interlinking & coming to consensus - we're given one-size-fits-all lowest common denominator functionality in the race to the bottom of the brain stem

there should be something like twitter's community notes for any kind of media - not just tweets

anyone should be able to construct graph narratives by selecting "facts" which can be observed & pointed at

just like we have a mental model when doing searches that we can request results only from the last month, the same way we'll learn to think in terms of filters & slices

we have a distorted view of reality because of the vocal and dominant minority - what if we allowed people to express themselves in aggregate without the consequences?

representative polititians are packages and are full of compromises

what if we could submit all our views & morals and feed that through aggregation algorithms that then score different policies to determine which ones should be chosen? And what if all this data was anonymized and yet public so anyone can re-do the aggregates?
What if we could pull ZK credentials for different criteria from our real identity and input those (in some anonymized fashion) into the aggregation algorithm?

This algorithm can be public & open source



The third attractor is bottom-up emergent order

> "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." - [Melvin E. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)

We’ve never had a true social network
A true social network allows data, events and identities to be linked in any way imaginable - today’s platforms are a lowest common denominator with hard constraints on how they can be extended

a bottom-up global governance system can only be built on top of a shared identity layer, trust, reputation & immutable history

boosting the competent through ranking their public information & track record objectively & transparently
we need to build the public introspection tool





all intelligence is collective intelligence

> "The collective cognition and decision-making of the colony is determined by the interactions between the individuals, resembling mobile neural networks, and the algorithms that determine their output." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The evolution of brains is a story of increasingly coordinated collective behavior, driven by the emergence of more efficient forms of intercellular communication, increasing differentiation and specialization of cell types, increasing interdependence, and progressive refinement of organization. At each stage, the benefits achieved through cooperation must have outweighed the costs of increased competition for resources that comes with sharing territory. Thus, we view brains as one end of a continuum of collective behavior wherein the collective has become especially coordinated and complex in organization." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Neural structure is not hard-coded into the genes — indeed, there couldn’t possibly be enough information in the human genome to encode neural structure — but instead is robustly reproduced time and again through these competitive dynamics. Malfunction of these processes (i.e., overproduction of neurons or lack of pruning) is associated with a number of brain disorders. Along these lines, proponents of “Neural Darwinism” and related views suggest that brain development, and intelligence more generally, can be understood as analogous to the evolution of a species through variation and selection." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Competitive dynamics are crucial both in brain development and in “online” cognition and behavior. We suggest that it is the precise parameterization of such competition dynamics that contributes to the intelligence of the brain. As such, we believe these mechanisms are best understood as a form of collective decision-making." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Functional networks are known to form and dissipate rapidly — on the order of milliseconds in visual processing, or on the timescale of minutes in skill acquisition — in a process that is often called “soft-assembly”. This process is best understood as a form of selforganization, in that the best functional network for a task or context comes online through distributed interactions, rather than by virtue of a central executive that assembles the best neural partners after assessing a situation." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "We suggest that the dynamic reorganization of functional subnetworks in the brain and the massive interactivity of the brain is best understood through the lens of collective intelligence, akin to a crowd that efficiently forms an effective committee for each task on the fly." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The intelligence of brains is due not to precisely designed neural circuits that implement specific computations, but instead due to an intrinsic capacity for collections of neurons to spontaneously organize in service of survival of the group." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "The structure and development of the brain is characterized by highly efficient and robust mechanisms of competition, cooperation, consensus building, and dynamic reconfiguration of neural coalitions." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Humans may have much to learn from neurons about constructing harmonious societies." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Collective intelligence in humans actually has little to do with how intelligent we are as individuals, and instead to the extent to which we are evolutionarily prepared for spontaneous interpersonal coordination." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "Any question about adaptation on a population level becomes one of collective intelligence." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "In a formulation of the “local knowledge problem,” Hayek argued that local, dispersed, and incomplete knowledge held by individuals within a market system allow for the rapid adaptation of the market to inputs and outputs in the economy. Hayek saw the emergence of a central intelligence, in the form of the price system, as being one way in which distributed systems create the appearance of a central actor." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "There is little reason to expect collective intelligence to be restricted to any particular species or spatio-temporal scale of activity." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

> "A brain is a collection of living cells struggling for survival. By virtue of mechanisms of competition, such as synaptogenesis/pruning and mutual inhibition, and mechanisms of cooperation, such as energysharing through spiking behavior, these collections of cells are able to rapidly self-organize into different patterns of functional connectivity that are adaptive at the group level with respect to a current task and context." - [All Intelligence is Collective Intelligence](https://psyarxiv.com/jhrp6)

Why Democracy Is Mathematically Impossible - Veritasium
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7ws2DF-zk

"Liquefying Democracy"

aggregation: the societal mirror - a chapter about signaling of public preferences & poll opinions
why are twitter polls only for 24 hours? and we can't see how specific people voted?
abstract polling: count & filter the results from any poll using any KYC filter or whatever ban list (so include/exclude for groups of people)
Reputation page and the message types that polls could be

empowerment - voter apathy is best explained by the disbelief that their vote would matter or that the pool of options is constrained and nothing is good enough. Also the complexity and cost of actually having a well informed opinion and the lack of ability to delegate automatically to someone they trust

> "When you think about it, our current political architecture is way out of date. Every few years, people play this odd game of selecting from among a handful of individuals some (one) person to “represent” them on a wide variety of issues, at some distant location, for years at a time. Two hundred fifty years ago, when hand written notes delivered by horses was cutting edge, this approach made a lot of sense.

liquid democracy can be used to inform how recommender systems work for any field - not just for political questions. Even content moderation

> "- Base-100 Vote: Voters have 100 points that they can cast for any voting issue, they can distribute those points arbitrarily in the network; this allows voters to express “partial agreement” or “partial disagreement votes” with issues and/or particular nodes, giving an unprecedented capacity of plasticity, specificity, self-organization, malleability, resiliency and robustness to the network. Example: A voter wants to automatically issue 50 of his 100 Points for Health-related issues to his doctor, 20 points to a family member that has knowledge in a related field, and keep 30 points for himself.
>
> - Negative Voting: Voters can use their points to subtract representational power from other individuals or groups who they feel are gathering too much weight in the system or that represent interests contrary to their stance. Example: A voter wants to use some of the points to mitigate the perceived excessive influence of an individual, while also issuing some of the points in favor of someone who holds a position that is considered to deserve more weight in the system.
>
> - Embedded Preference: Voters can propagate their points to their selected representatives with an embedded preference, so the representatives can know what is the personal intention of their representees, and might or might not choose to follow their recommendation. Example: A voter indicates that he is in favor of a certain level of tax, but his representative might choose to cast a vote that is different to that initial preference (The latency system will always offer the owner of the points the chance to certify the use of their voting power)
>
> - Divided Voting: Voters might want to vote for individuals or issues that are inherently in opposition to each other, maybe as a way to express their recognition for good political work on different individuals or groups holding different stances, or simply because there is an actual indecision or ambiguity, or because they want to leverage the playing field by making a certain decision more contested. This confers the system a virtually infinite capacity of self-correction and nuanced complexity. Example: A voter might want to use some of the points to support “Individual A” while also recognizing the validity of argument presented by “Individual B”
>
> - Transparent or Secret Voting: Voters might chose to cast their points in a public or private way, they can even hide their points from the recipients, to avoid them from playing into populist positions. This quality of the system also reduces strategies of preference falsification that is intrinsic to a scheme that only allows for secret voting, as no user has any evidence of what a certain voter really stands for; by having public voting as an option, individuals can confirm what are the actual positions of other nodes in the network. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Vote History: Voters have total control over the historical use and current holders of their representational power. Example: A voter might want to cast some votes publicly in favor of a certain group or individual, but other voters would not be able to see what other votes have been issued by the same individual if he/she opt for such.
>
> - Boolean & Gradient Voting: The community can vote on boolean (binary) and gradient-ed (nuanced) issues, as the total amount of votes can indicate not only if a decision should be made, but also how much of that decision should be implemented. Example: Should drones fly at +30000 feet with commercial planes? (Yes/No) ? Once the community has voted for “No”, then a vote can be issued about what is the maximum flight at which drones would be allowed to fly (0 ft. to 29 999 ft.) in which case a Bell-Shaped curve of votes would probably result on drones maximum fly height to be set at ~15 000 ft." - [Competency-Based Propagative Democracy](https://ernestoeduardo.medium.com/propagative-democracy-c00e5d327194#:~:text=Base%2D100%20Vote,15%20000%20ft.)

> "Advertising is legitimised lying." - [H. G. Wells](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/37198-advertising-is-legitimised-lying)


Its not advertising thats the problem - its the lack of negative reputation and the lack pf an immune system

Signaling slot machine tactics through negative reputation

we need to counteract market failures and negative externalities but currently we don't have the means to do so - we can't come to a consensus and organize

wealth leads to power over regulation which leads to making more money in the market - a positive feedback loop that doesn't have a counteracting force - such systems are unstable and self-terminate

> "The adaptive immune system is a complex system involving different immune cells, signaling molecules and cytokines, however, the importance of different feedback and feedforward loops (FFLs) and the underlying crosstalks are often overlooked. In particular, negative feedback loops are very important in regulating the response that determines immunity vs. tolerance." - [Importance of Feedback and Feedforward Loops to Adaptive Immune Response Modeling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202469/#:~:text=The%20adaptive%20immune%20system,determines%20immunity%20vs.%20tolerance.)

Today's economy driven by advertising is mostly comprised of positive feedback loops but we also need to develop channels for negative feedback loops
a positive feedback loop: advertising tricks us into buying processed food which makes us sicker which takes a toll on our finances and happiness which leads to going back to food for pleasure
positive feedback loops in the economy are way stronger than negative feedback loops because of the disproportionate influence of money and advertising over us

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtxV5AyWcAA3itz?format=jpg

what if you value funding fundamental science and want to signal that more than 0.1% of the GDP should go towards it?

what if instead of caring if someone liked your nonsense tweet you had cast a vote and can see if others vote the same way as you - not liking a textual comment of yours, but you influencing them to vote the same way you did

what if we could signal-boost anything - like "ppl with large following all endorse X futuristic and hopeful movie"
chapter: signal-boosting

"here are the 5 things that have made the biggest impression on me (or are the most underrated): "and actually list them! MC course, Carl Sagan's cosmos, Naval, Fall of civilizations. We can signal values and from that public info later decide which people to join/partner with towards a common cause. We can make a heatmap of the global (& local!) causes that people care about, and to what degree

not only sensemaking but also meaningmaking - collective progress and transparency through immutability, identity, deduplication & connectedness


we're currently screaming out our beliefs in comments of the culture war when instead we could express our view only once and have it fed through the algorithms where it would actually be taken into account

shifting social media goals from engagement to impact

Putting individuals in the drivers seat

https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1641134999406780417
TODO: how to transform this and turn it into a global "top 7" dashboard/chart? and in the semantic web?

What if we could all signal our top X biggest concerns?

One of the biggest drawbacks of language-based communication is the inability to aggregate & analyze sentiment unambiguously and throughout time.


A data network in which your input matters in an uncountable number of ways
Expressivity!

what if we could downregulate/influence the use of things in the real world such as fast foods brands? what if negative reputation is a feature - not a bug? The physical world is now downstream of the digital. Sunlight is the best disinfectant

> "Every time users like, upvote, heart, link or retweet content they are signaling a preference that serves a feedback loop generating better recommendations for them. But the action won’t go any further: it’s a fake vote that lacks institutional implications." - [The Social Smart Contract](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper#user-content-231_Liquid:~:text=Every%20time%20users%20like%2C%20upvote%2C%20heart%2C%20link%20or%20retweet%20content%20they%20are%20signaling%20a%20preference%20that%20serves%20a%20feedback%20loop%20generating%20better%20recommendations%20for%20them.%20But%20the%20action%20won%E2%80%99t%20go%20any%20further%3A%20it%E2%80%99s%20a%20fake%20vote%20that%20lacks%20institutional%20implications.)


what if we could gauge the trustfulness of a brand? or how much it is being recommended? What if we could see that healthy & successful people explicitly downregulate fast food - how might that impact us the next time we see a commercial with someone healthy-looking promoting cheap chicken fries?

our current culture is of consumerism - what if we could shift that? How would we shift that?

> "Citizen journalism is vital to the future of civilization" - [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1615461396313178115)

Many social networks have polls about preferences & beliefs - we've filled so much questionnaires but none of them have been truly meaningful

What if we could signal our values and then be held accountable according to them? Like "being considerate instead of tribal" or "considering both sides of an argument"

Vernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere and described as the planetary "sphere of reason". The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, that of humankind's rational activities.

As mankind organizes itself in more complex social networks, the higher the noosphere will grow in awareness. This concept extends Teilhard's Law of Complexity/Consciousness, the law describing the nature of evolution in the universe. Teilhard argued the noosphere is growing towards an even greater integration and unification, culminating in the Omega Point - an apex of thought/consciousness - which he saw as the goal of history." - [Noosphere, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere#:~:text=For%20de%20Chardin,goal%20of%20history.)

We can use LLMs to annotate long-form media and link to all the claims

LLMs can help craft a propositional claim with structured data
^^ THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR HURDLE FOR THE ADOPTION OF A SEMANTIC WEB - THE INACCESIBILITY for normal people to express themselves in such a way and to consume such data. LLMs fix this.

We can have approved LLMs for tagging data and use zk-ml to prove that the specific model was used
ZK-ML alternatives: optimistic fraud proofs & cryptoeconomics
https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/dont-trust-verify-an-overview-of-decentralized-inference-c471a9f7a586

how do we express "I don't want fast food in my neightbourhood"?
What if you could ask an LLM "what does my neightbourhood want to change?"

Use LLMs to contribute annotations and structured data and use LLMs to speak back at you what the aggregate thinks

LLMs will be the global brain interpreters and narrators

We could have a specialized LLM trained specifically to "talk" in the language of this system (construct structured data with the right ontologies)

We can use LLMs to generate the headlines/summaries to combat clickbait

LLMs are the gate/bridge to structure, aggregation, and integration

imagine talking with the aggregate sentiment and knowledge of the world with the help of an LLM and exploring humanity in real time through any lens you wish - not with some pre-trained model without a clue how the sausage was made

what if AI alignment is the process of turning up the level of cooperation democratically and publically and then train LLMs to best extract the most accurate levels of values of society

we can rank different sources of signal differently and prioritize the weights of the LLM differently when "extracting" the compressed version of our collective conscience

> "Collective intelligence is a natural property of socially shared cognition, a natural enabler of collaboration. But there are also natural forces that challenge collective intelligence, forces that doom projects and make collaboration difficult or impossible. These are forces of fragmentation.
>
> The concept of fragmentation provides a name and an image for a phenomenon that pulls apart something which is potentially whole. Fragmentation suggests a condition in which the people involved see themselves as more separate than united, and in which information and knowledge are chaotic and scattered. The fragmented pieces are, in essence, the perspectives, understandings, and intentions of the collaborators. Fragmentation, for example, is when the stakeholders in a project are all convinced that their version of the problem is correct. Fragmentation can be hidden, as when stakeholders don’t even realize that there are incompatible tacit assumptions about the problem, and each believes that his or her understandings are complete and shared by all. The antidote to fragmentation is shared understanding and shared commitment." - [Wicked Problems & Social Complexity, by Jeff Conklin](https://cognexus.org/wpf/wickedproblems.pdf)

> "The antidote for fragmentation is coherence. How, then, do we create coherence? In organizations and project teams – in situations where collaboration is the life blood of success – coherence amounts to shared understanding and shared commitment. Shared understanding of meaning and context, and of the dimensions and issues in the problem. Shared commitment to the processes of project work and to the emergent solution matrix. Coherence means that stakeholders have shared meaning for key terms and concepts, that they are clear about their role in the effort, that together they have a shared understanding of the background for the project and what the issues are, and that they have a shared commitment to how the project will reach its objectives and achieve success. Coherence means that the project team understands and is aligned with the goals of the project and how to reach them. Coherence means that a wicked problem is recognized as such, and appropriate tools and processes are constantly used to ‘defragment’ the project. With increased coherence, more collective intelligence becomes available to deal with change and complexity." - [Wicked Problems & Social Complexity, by Jeff Conklin](https://cognexus.org/wpf/wickedproblems.pdf)

> "This practice **of presenting a plausible hypothesis as if true** ranks as one of the most common problems within current media. Sometimes this is done accidentally, when claims are made in haste or with an honest misunderstanding of the data. However, the practice of presenting a plausible hypothesis as if true is also undertaken intentionally, as a technique of informational and narrative warfare.
>
> One classic technique is the use of leading questions and insinuations: **“Couldn’t it be true that…” “How do you know for sure that they didn’t…” “Isn’t it convenient that…” “Isn’t it strange that that… “Sure seems to be quite a coincidence that…”** This often involves social shaming associated with not getting the correlation (even though unvalidated): **“You’d have to be an idiot (or member of some disliked “outgroup”) to not realize…”**" - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=This%20practice%20of,to%20not%20realize%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D)

> "**Presenting plausible hypotheses as if true** sets off a polarization dynamic that is hard to contain: different groups are able to claim “their own truths,” making the situation fundamentally irreconcilable.
>
> Best practice is to explicitly gauge and discuss the plausibility of a claim when presenting them. Hypotheses should ideally be ranked in terms of their plausibility, as the availability and quality of evidence dictates. This ranking itself is open for discussion and revision. Those claims that can be easily verified should be, and kept distinct from those that require more inquiry, and from those that are in the realm of what is unverifiable." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Presenting%20plausible%20hypotheses,what%20is%20unverifiable.)

> "**Frame control is a form of motivated reasoning where a political or ethical commitment is used to frame what is selected for discussion and presentation.** This can be done in haste, or unconsciously. But sometimes the work of frame control takes place intentionally. Instead of trying to accurately communicate a story that properly reflects known information, facts and evidence are cherry-picked to fit the preselected frame.
>
> ...
>
> Often frame control is much less concerned with logical persuasion or conveyance of particular facts than with controlling the interpretive framework in which the whole story can be understood. Rather than make a logical argument, particular ideas and images are selected (or excluded), these are juxtaposed in a suggestive manner, leaving an emotional or moral impression that important claims have been settled. This is often true, even though certain other important claims and evidence that were not mentioned remain unsettled.
>
> Best practices for media to avoid frame control include: **Show as much data as you can that is relevant; orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed; know when fact checking is not enough; clarify what is important and why to justify focus; share multiple frames; acknowledge what is not known and where there is no basis for certainty; argue counter narratives and share facts that seem to support an alternative hypothesis**" - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Frame%20control%20is,an%20alternative%20hypothesis)

> "**Competing unverifiable claims result in a situation of narrative deadlock in which irreconcilable views become entrenched.** There is no way out of deadlock until the competing narratives can be broken down into potentially verifiable elements, which can then become a focus of investigation by both parties. Absent an earnest assessment of the veracity of claims there is no way to resolve a dispute, and so the tactic of engagement often reverts into frame control rather than analysis and argumentation. Where the situation is such that we cannot verify or falsify key elements, then all parties should hold tentative beliefs with low enough confidence to not start “wars” over them. The ability to hold beliefs tentatively is important also for any person or group seeking to avoid confirmation bias." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Competing%20unverifiable%20claims,avoid%20confirmation%20bias.)

> "To avoid being captured by polarization there must be awareness of the negative impacts of the dynamic, as well as the means by which it takes effect. Polarization involves not doing synthesis; it means being wrong or at least problematically partial. Polarization dynamics also result in orienting towards “war” rather than coordination. The dynamics sometimes stem from actual, explicit political alliances, but almost always involve appealing to the biases and emotions of an in-group against an out-group. The speed bias forcing sloppy work, as soundbites force a narrowing of perspectives and advertising revenues demand more clicks and longer times on page, reinforces polarization." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=To%20avoid%20being,page%2C%20reinforces%20polarization.)

> "It is possible to act in ways that decrease polarization. The media should explicitly differentiate, gauge, and discuss the plausibility of claims when presenting them. As complexity and polarization increases it becomes more important to show as much data as you can that is relevant, to orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed, and to know when fact-checking is not enough. When narrowing focus, clarify what is important and essential to know, justify and explain why one story is being told rather than another. Polarization decreases to the extent that public culture is characterized by intelligent voices that are earnestly seeking out and articulating the views of all relevant groups as part of leading to understanding." - [Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=it%20is%20possible,leading%20to%20understanding.)

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.
