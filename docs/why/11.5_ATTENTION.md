> "Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system." - [Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/)

> "I have long said that attention is the cursor of consciousness. This means that whoever or whatever controls my attention controls my consciousness, and whoever or whatever controls my consciousness ultimately determines who I actually am.
>
> ... These reward stimuli affect our minds whenever we look at our phones. As a result, we’re being programmed to expect and desire a very unnatural state of immediacy. Compare this with how the brains of our species — which evolved in the material world — until very recently made use of our neuro-modulator-based psychological reward system. That system was called on far, far less frequently — certainly, not constantly.
>
> ... Today, things are different. We reach for our phones the instant the plane lands — or when we have 15 seconds of downtime in the grocery checkout line — not because our lives are so insanely fast that something actually needs our ATTENTION RIGHT NOW, but because we have been nonconsciously programmed to experience a neuromodulator reward whenever we take out our phone and get an inbound update, text message, email, or like. The same thing happens when we gain a false sense of “having found something useful” by scanning the news for what’s happening right this very minute with the dramatic political absurdities gripping our country.
>
> ... In short, the instincts of our social hunter-gatherer brains — to seek social interaction and be constantly scanning the environment for food and sources of danger — have been co-opted to instead hook us on yet another like or incoming text message about something that is usually trivial, or is otherwise consciously designed (with the help of cutting-edge cognitive science) to manipulate us.

We aren’t much more than trained lab rats when it comes to compulsively looking at our phones 80 to 300 times a day!" - [Reclaiming Our Cognitive Sovereignty, by Jim Rutt](https://medium.com/@memetic007/reclaiming-our-cognitive-sovereignty-f49f30eb26bb)

Kasparov is far better at chess than you are at controlling your attention, and he also knew he was playing a game." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://www.sloww.co/daniel-schmachtenberger/)

The importance of attention cannot be overstated. One of the most transformative papers in AI/ML is called `"Attention is all you need"` not by coincidence. Attention has opportunity costs. It is a resource and hence we "pay" attention. It also takes energy to process information.

> "What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it." - [Herbert A.

> "We have a really hard time distinguishing between “having attention” and “deserving attention;”
>
> ... When we look at our hardwired “attention allocation” functions, we discover that human beings use a pretty simple model: pay attention to the people who other people are paying attention to.
>
> ... As a society, we are obsessed with who has attention, and conspicuously less interested in whether it is deserved. Among many things, this deficit leads to the cultural consequence of “celebrity”. Since having attention is hard to separate from deserving attention, simply having the camera pointing at you implicitly confers upon you some of the power and credentials of authority. This is why we find ourselves in the situation where Hollywood entertainers and professional athletes are empowered to steward good opinion far beyond their actual expertise.
>
> ... In a broadcast world, merely being “on camera” is to be credentialed. Regardless of your actual capabilities, insight, or character, if you can somehow manage to get on camera you are granted actual audience *and* social authority (Kim Kardashian)." - [Understanding the Blue Church, by Jordan Hall](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5)

Attention redundancy：The opportunity cost of the social media distraction, by Ashley Hodgson
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oCL_-qK0bQ
opportunity costs of everyone's attention locked into the same things
- friends & family
- our professions
- system accountability
don't include the video but think about these things

How do we make a system where really egregious things don't have to become top of mind for everyone just to have them fixed? What if we could let people rank the importance of events, such that the need for a response is determined by importance, but even if something is important, if it is outside of my area of expertise that I don't have to even hear about it, and yet still there to be an incentive to actually identify really important things and have them fixed? What if those ranking the importance of events were on the hook for not accurately ranking the importance of something retroactively?
what if there were 2 types of importance signals: normal importance and one relevant to fraud for the system itself? what if we only drew attention to everyone (even those who can't do anything about it) only for fraud in the system of incentives?





> "They amplify the output of each individual, choosing broadcast by default. These apps don’t encourage individuals to explicitly address an audience... These antisocial defaults are by design. Social Media incentivizes individuals to produce as much content as possible, so that others get inundated and must use some type of filter. By intermediating every conversation, they gain an enormous amount of power." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627#:~:text=They%20amplify%20the,amount%20of%20power.)

> "For groups of people and society at large, what we actually have is an amplification problem.
>
> Amplification, at the scale we’ve achieved in modern society, creates a bulk scarcity of attention. That is actually the hard limit that is driving a sense of “censorship” when e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube decide to “de-platform” someone. We are now so used to an amplified media environment (ShoutBox), that the lack of amplification is equated to actual censorship.
>
> Thus, the historical principle enshrined in “freedom of the press” has now morphed into “access to amplification”. But since all the routes from pixel to eyeball are owned by private carriers (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), revocation of this access is total and absolute, and utterly controlled by private actors. Almost no corporate actor by itself has a total monopoly on broadcast and distribution, but taken together, the telecom+social media companies form a cartel whose control over attention is nearly absolute." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "A group’s attention becomes more scarce as it becomes more synchronized. In the business world, we all know that having too many meetings literally kills bandwidth to get anything done. But the same is true of any human organization, including the entirety of society.
>
> We must view individual attention as a societal good; and we should see society-wide “joint attention” as, in fact, a Commons, like fresh air or clean water. But unlike air or water, synchronous attention is a manufactured scarcity.
>
> Anyone who has ever been in a position of leadership knows how critically important it is for a group to “know a thing”, and to “know that everyone knows”. In a business, this could be the corporate mission or quarterly goals. It’s why we have regular status meetings to “get everyone on the same page”.
>
> A society is no different. Prior to Internet, we relied on broadcast technologies to be a memetic metronome, and to set a cadence of sense-making and norm-reinforcement for a very large and diverse tribe. The decoherence of this joint-attention erodes foundational intersubjective beliefs, and destroys society by allowing individuals to “spin off” into a thousand diverse little subjectivities.
>
> In the current environment of information warfare and accelerated fracturing into memetic tribes, how we apportion control over this Commons is the single most important question facing every country. This principle — that the sense-making environment should be a socially-governed Commons — is a new one. It is only apparent now, because tech has gotten so powerful that it can flood and clog the information environment at such massive scale.
>
> It is on this principle that we can establish a modernized version of the Fairness Doctrine, which strives to define a healthy information diet for all citizens. Furthermore, by recognizing that synchronicity is a key aspect of memetic power, tech companies may be able to engineer better solutions to balance amplification while mitigating potential harm, by modeling the temporal availability and spread of a particular piece of content." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "Attention is one of the most fundamental components of a conscious identity. When something hijacks or manipulates a person’s attention, it’s actively eroding their independent self-hood as a conscious individual. The giving and the receiving of attention are both intimate acts. These acts are the very basis of all human communications, and by extension, human societies. Any tools or technologies that mediate this act need to be designed with great care." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "McLuhan famously declared that “the medium is the message”. But few seem to recognize that Social Media isn’t a “medium” in any traditional sense. Because it transmits and amplifies different content in variable ways, responding to the content itself, it is an active participant. If it was merely a constant, static amplification, then we could apply our traditional tools for assessing accountability and limiting harm. These include libel laws and the (now-repealed) Fairness Doctrine.
>
> This variable amplification at the heart of “viral” social media isn’t an accident or a software bug. It is a necessary component of driving engagement for their business model. It creates a “Lottery of Fame” for every post, every image. Instead of everyone getting their 15 minutes of fame, social media apps seduce you with the possibility of getting 15 seconds of micro-fame: You could be an influencer, reaching millions, trending in the sidebar! This hijacks our primate-level desire for status. It’s especially toxic for young users, who become aware of status games among peers at a very early age.
>
> Social media apps mine attention from captive masses, and mint it into social capital. We are training entire generations of youth to treat their phones as digital slot machines — “One-finger bandits” that use dynamic amplification to provide the possibility of “going viral” to keep people swiping. This “manufactured scarcity” in social media is actually a specific instance of the broader principle around network effects, brilliantly articulated in this essay/podcast by James Currier and Eugene Wei: Status Games: Engineering Scarcity in a World of Abundance." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

Active inference needs attention to allocate exploitative, exploratory, or passive learning resources

> "**4.1. Active Inference Requires Attention** Active inference, at its most basic, is a trade-off between acting on the environment to meet expectations and learning from the environment to modify expectations. Even with only a single stimulus, and hence a single component for which environmental variational free energy (VFE) is measured, the importance—encoded in the theory as Bayesian precision—placed on input versus expected values affects the balance between expectation-meeting and expectation-updating. Action on the environment can, moreover, include both exploitative actions that meet current expectations and exploratory actions that increase the probability of learning. Enacting these distinctions requires a prioritization or attention system. Spreading VFE across multiple distinguishable stimuli increases the need for attention to allocate exploitative, exploratory, or passive learning resources. Even in E. coli, competition among chemoreceptors for control of flagellar motion implements a rudimentary form of attention." - [How Do Living Systems Create Meaning? by Chris Fields & Michael Levin](https://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/5/4/36)

TODO: look at ep 4 about cognition and the accompanying post on medium

> "Historically, there have been three main perspectives for defining consciousness...
>
> **Consciousness as functional awareness and responsivity**
>
> Tracing the evolutionary trajectory, we can observe the emergence and complexification of consciousness through different stages. With the jump from the Matter-Object dimension to the Life-Organism dimension, we say that, under the broad definition of consciousness, living organisms operating as complex adaptive systems are conscious to the extent they exhibit functional awareness and responsivity. However, there are no claims of subjective inner experience; just patterns of activity that are functionally organized.
>
> **Consciousness as subjective conscious experience**
>
> Consciousness in the form of subjective conscious experience begins to take shape in the context of neurocognitive activity in animals with brains and complex active bodies. UTOK posits that “flashes” of valence qualia emerge as sensory elements are yoked to energized motions and start to give rise to a unified perceptual experience. In other words, the interplay between external sensory input, internal perception, and the motivated action output forms the essence of the animal-environment feedback loop. These elements are bounded together to create a broadcast function to coordinate the animal’s attention and action. This then turns into a stage of working memory and ultimate forms an “inner mind’s eye” in creatures like crows and dogs.
>
> **Consciousness as reflective self-awareness**
>
> Finally, after evolving through the animal kingdom, consciousness takes up the form of reflective self-awareness. Proto self-awareness emerges in several animals. Explicit self-conscious reflective awareness emerges as our ancestors started to justify their experiences to themselves and others in the social stage.
>
> ... In sum, the concept of consciousness refers to a multilayered, evolved phenomenon that, when viewed through a UTOK lens, can be coherently organized. It helps us see clearly the broad and general definition of functional awareness and responsivity, and then homes in on the primary meaning as subjective conscious experience that likely started as flashes of sentience in early animals, and tracks that through the integration of sensations and perceptions into a cohesive witnessing experience, and ultimately into recursive self-awareness and reflective narration in humans." - [Now UTOKing: Consciousness, by Gregg Henriques](https://medium.com/unified-theory-of-knowledge/now-utoking-consciousness-df6cb156d62e)

> "Consciousness: Consciousness is the ability to monitor, examine and redirect mental processes. Most processes in the human brain are subconscious: they happen immediately and automatically, in the background, without any possibility for the self to intervene. Examples are reex reactions, recognition of objects and understanding of language. For conscious processes, such as acting, thinking, or speaking, on the other hand, we can conceive different possibilities, and choose between them. We can also correct the process if it does not go as desired." - [Glossary of Concepts, Human Energy](https://www.humanenergy.io/glossary)

## Consciousness as Awareness and as Experience

> "What is consciousness? We use the term “consciousness” to refer to a number of distinct phenomena. On the one hand, we use it to refer to a set of phenomena related to **awareness**, and on the other hand, we use it to refer to a set of phenomena related to **experience**. We need to begin by disambiguating those two uses of the term; I will do so following the account in Chalmers.
>
> On the **awareness** side, we say that someone is “conscious” of a given fact or piece of information to indicate that he or she is cognitively aware of that fact or information, meaning roughly that he or she knows it or believes it explicitly and is able to access it cognitively. Similarly, we speak of someone’s “conscious state” when we wish to refer to everything that he or she is currently aware of, especially everything that currently falls under the scope of his or her attention. And we say that someone is “conscious” to indicate that he or she is not asleep or comatose, but “awake” and cognitively aware of his or her situation. Awareness is a functionalist notion. It can be explicated in ordinary, third-personal scientific terms. We can devise functional tests for awareness and attention, for instance by considering a subject’s behavioural responses to certain cognitive tasks and by observing his or her interactions with the environment...
>
> On the **experience** side, by contrast, we speak of someone’s “consciousness” to refer to what he or she subjectively experiences: what it is like to be that agent, from the first-personal point of view. This includes “the felt quality of redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field”, “the sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs”, bodily sensations such as pleasures and pains, the subjective quality of emotions, and so on. Philosophers also use the terms “phenomenal experience” or “qualia” to refer these subjectively experienced, first-personal states. Unlike awareness, phenomenal experience is not a functionalist notion and does not easily lend itself to an ordinary, third-personal scientific analysis...
>
> Nagel put his finger on something that later led to Chalmers’s distinction between the “easy” and “hard” problems of consciousness. The “easy” problems are to explain the structure of awareness and the various phenomena related to it, for instance “the ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli; the integration of information by a cognitive system; the reportability of mental states; the ability of a system to access its own internal states; the focus of attention; the deliberate control of behavior; the difference between wakefulness and sleep”.
>
> What makes the “easy” problems easy is not that it does not take time, patience, hard work, and ingenuity to explain the phenomena in question. Of course, it does, and scientists deserve to win major prizes for relevant discoveries. What makes them easy is that, being essentially functional phenomena, they are amenable to an ordinary scientific analysis, using the tools of a broadly physicalist science.
>
> The “hard” problem, by contrast, is to explain phenomenal experience itself. We need to explain the following: why are we not merely functional systems which, for example, form beliefs about red objects, say for distinguishing ripe from unripe tomatoes, so that we can eat the former but not the latter? Why is there something it feels like to experience the bright red of a perfectly ripe tomato? In short, we need to explain why there is something it is like to be us, why we have phenomenal states at all, as opposed to merely functional states.
>
> As Chalmers notes, “[w]hat makes the hard problem hard and almost unique is that it goes beyond problems about the performance of functions”. While most other phenomena studied in the sciences are of a functionalist kind, a purely functionalist account of an agent cannot explain, even in principle, why certain phenomenal states accompany the functional ones. There seems to be no logical contradiction involved in postulating an agent who is functionally indistinguishable from an ordinary human being, who is even indistinguishable with respect to everything that has to do with awareness, but who lacks any phenomenal experience. Such an agent is called a zombie. The point is that the notion of a zombie is logically coherent, even if it turns out that there are no zombies in the actual world. And the very coherence of that notion is enough to illustrate that the phenomenal facts about an agent, if there are any, are not simply subsumed by the functional facts, but go beyond them.

## Group Consciousness as Awareness Only

> "... when I investigate whether there is such a thing as group consciousness I do not refer to the conscious experiences of the individual members of a group, nor to the experiences that might go along with participating in joint action... My focus here is on the question of whether the group as a whole can have such a thing as consciousness.
>
> ... group agents can certainly have consciousness as awareness. We can meaningfully talk about which pieces of information a group agent such as the FBI is aware of in an investigation; and we can give an ordinary functionalist analysis of what we mean by awareness here. For instance, something on which the group agent holds an explicit belief, and which is accessible and reportable, falls under the umbrella of its awareness. We can also meaningfully talk about which things a group agent attends to or fails to attend to. For instance, an organization that has been struck by some scandal might give its attention to this issue and act so as to become clean; this could involve organizationally endorsing and enacting a new policy or code of conduct. We can even make sense of the idea of perceptual awareness in a group agent. As an information processing system, a group agent has various routes of epistemic access to the world. These are mediated through its individual members and its procedures, just as an individual agent’s perception is mediated through its sense organs and cognitive processes. And they may be sensitive to some features of the environment but not to others. Just as we humans are sensitive to sounds at certain frequencies but not to sounds outside that range, so a group agent may be perceptually sensitive to some environmental features but not to others.
>
> It should be evident that all of these phenomena can be analysed in ordinary functionalist terms. And the awareness capacities listed by Chalmers, such as “the ability to discriminate, categorize, and react to environmental stimuli”, “the integration of information by a cognitive system”, “the focus of attention”, and “the deliberate control of behavior”, can in principle be found in group agents as much as they can be found in individuals.
>
> Even the notions of “wakefulness and sleep” make sense in the context of a group agent. My university goes on vacation from time to time, which means that all offices and institutional activities are closed, all email servers go into vacation-response mode, and all official business is put on hold until the end of the break. The group agent will “wake up” and respond during that break only in a real emergency, such as a scandal suddenly uncovered by the press. This parallels the way in which a sleeping person or animal may wake up in a threatening situation.
>
> My claim that group agents can have consciousness as **awareness** is not just metaphorical. Rather, we can be realists about a group’s awareness, using the resources of functionalism about agency...
>
> ... Let me close by returning to my original question: what is it like to be a group agent? Although my argument is tentative and conditional, it seems that the answer may well be: (close to) nothing." - [What is it like to be a group agent? by Christian List](https://philarchive.org/rec/LISWII)

## Attention Schema Theory (AST)

Michael Graziano - A Conceptual Framework for Consciousness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDBYAJ1oUw

> "Awareness is the brain's way of describing to itself what it means to focus attention on something." - [Michael Graziano](https://youtu.be/H8twgvcA-Ko?t=349)

> "The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’ ... The heart of the attention schema theory is that there is an adaptive value for a brain to build the construct of awareness: it serves as a model of attention... The attention schema theory accounts in a natural way for one of the most puzzling and mysterious aspects of awareness, the fact that we can become aware of both external and internal events.
>
> ... The ‘biased competition’ theory characterizes attention as a signal competition within the brain. Signals compete in order to be more deeply processed and ultimately to influence and guide behavior. This signal competition emerges at the earliest stages of processing in the nervous system and is present at every stage... As signals progress through the nervous system, they are increasingly subject to the influence of top–down, biasing signals. By this method, attention can be internally directed, slanting the outcome of this signal competition in a goal-directed manner based on the demands of the current task. Signals that correspond to current goals can be boosted and irrelevant signals can be suppressed.
>
> ... The body schema appears to be a simplified, and therefore sometimes inaccurate, model of the body’s configuration. Converging evidence from both psychology and neurophysiology suggests that the brain relies on a set of relatively robust, but ultimately limited, tricks in order to compute the configuration of the body. Though these tricks tend to work well under normal circumstances, laboratory scenarios can be devised that result in the dissociation of the body schema and the actual configuration of the body... To enter a car without hitting your head requires the body schema to include an accurate model of the shape of your head. Women who wore feathered hats would develop an altered body schema to incorporate the hat, and would avoid hitting the feathers.
>
> ... We argue that this relationship – between a real thing, the brain’s representation of that thing, and the successful control of that thing – can be fruitfully applied to understanding the relationship between attention and awareness. In this perspective, awareness is an internal model of attention useful for the control of attention.
>
> ... What you attend to, you are more likely to react to. What you do not attend to, you are very unlikely to react to. Therefore a model of attention could help in predicting one’s own behavior. For example, if you have any intuitive understanding of attention, of its dynamics and consequences for behavior, and if you are concerned about your diet, then you know not to stand all night next to the dessert tray at a party. Out of sight, out of mind – this maxim is essentially about the dynamics of attention.
>
> ... We argue that because attention is such a complex and variable process, because a brain must control its own attention, and because an internal model is essential for efficient control, the brain is almost certain to have an attention schema – an internal model of attention... The attention schema would not depict synapses, neurons, lateral inhibition, or electrochemical signals. The brain has no need to model its own processes in that kind of physical detail. Instead, the attention schema would depict something physically incoherent, a process without a physical manifestation – a mental possession or experience of something that empowers one to react to the item.
>
> ... Why would the brain compute such an incomplete model of its own processes? Because that is all that is needed for the model to be useful. Just as the body schema does not need to represent the mechanistic and cellular details of the body in order to keep track of its general structure and current configuration, a detailed, complete, neuroscientific account of attention is not necessary for keeping track of the current state and general dynamics of attention.
>
> ... Awareness is part of the control mechanism for attention. Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise... In the absence of awareness of a stimulus, the effects of that stimulus on attention and therefore on behavior cannot be regulated in line with goals or task demands as well as when the stimulus is consciously perceived... Things go on under the surface of consciousness. And in that condition, when you react unconsciously, you have no control over that reaction. It just pops out. How can you control it, if you’re not conscious of it? Everyone knows this to be true. It is intuitively obvious.
>
> ... It is folk psychology in which, with some circularity, consciousness is the thing in me that, when conscious of something, allows me to consciously choose how to react to that thing. The present theory provides a specific, underlying explanation for these common folk intuitions. At the root of these effects is awareness as a model of attention. Without awareness, without that model of attention, the control of attention and therefore of behavioral reaction is poor... It is tempting to conclude that attention is a universal feature of brain function, acting within and between any dimensions in which the brain can process information.
>
> ... The complex phenomenon of a stimulus being selectively processed by the brain, attention, is represented in a simplified model, an attention schema. This model leaves out many of the mechanistic details of the actual phenomenon of attention, and instead depicts a mysterious, physically impossible property – awareness. The brain reports the presence of awareness of the stimulus because it is reporting the contents of its internal models. The brain can report only the information available to it through its internal models." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full)

awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.

## Global Workspace Theory

> "Consciousness is like fame in the brain." - Daniel Denett

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.
>
> ... It serves as a central information exchange, rather than a locus of cognition itself, enabling different specialized brain networks to interact and supporting integrated and adaptive responses." - [Global workspace theory, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory#:~:text=GWT%20analogizes%20the,and%20adaptive%20responses.)

This whole thing should be optional - not visible by default. Very long, and not part of the core.

> "2. What is a Hivemind Society?
>
> For our purposes, we can distinguish two kinds of hiveminds. In the broad sense, a hivemind society is one in which individual agents together form a further agent of some moral significance (the “collective” or, as we prefer, the “hivemind”). As we will see, in this broad sense, we are all plausibly already participating in many such minor hiveminds. In the narrow sense, a hivemind society is one in which what otherwise might have been independent agents have no moral value of their own; the agents have “dissolved” into the collective, and are not recoverable as separate entities from the collective. Though it is useful to separate these notions, we are inclined to think there is not in fact a sharp line between these types of hiveminds. The question is really one of degree: to what extent are potentially independent agents merged with a collective, and to what extent has the moral emphasis shifted from the merging agents to the merged agent? The idea that the distinction between a hivemind society and an individualist society is not a sharp or precise one might strike some readers as frustratingly vague or imprecise but we believe that this emphasis on degrees of difference is both metaphysically accurate and, as will become clear, something that can be used to encourage people to take a different perspective on the axiology of hivemind societies: because some of us are, in the broad sense, already tending towards or participating in hivemind-ish societies we can at least be open to the possibility of going further in this direction...
>
> 3. Why we Should be Open to the Hivemind Society
>
> The first argument can be thought of as a warm-up. It is not intended to prove the desirability of a hivemind society. It is, rather, intended to loosen the imaginative constraints that typically confront people when thinking about the idea of a hivemind society. One of those constraints, felt particularly strongly in Western liberal societies, is that we are currently committed to a kind of individualist moral framework, one in which individuals are the primary and most important locus of moral significance. This is not to say that we are ideologically pure individualists. As we shall point out below, there are anti-individualist, pro-hivemind features of our current moral views, and there are communities and cultures around the world that embrace a more communitarian, anti-individualist outlook. Nevertheless, individualism does seem to be dominant in Western, liberal societies, and the commitment to individualism is often reflected in both moral practices and legal norms of those communities. To free us from the constraints of an individualist outlook, the first argument encourages us to first adopt a principle of axiological openness, i.e. a willingness to consider and experiment with different moral possibilities, and then apply that principle to the possibility of a hivemind society.
>
> The principle of axiological openness is a form of historical common sense. We know that moral norms and preferences have shifted many times over the course of human history. If you were a white man living in a European society in the late 1700s it is likely that you would have endorsed slavery and colonialism, thought that women should be denied the legal rights of men, favoured capital punishment and legal torture, and judged homosexuality to be morally abhorrent. While the remnants of these attitudes linger to this day, the radical shift in the moral consensus on these matters since the late 1700s has been remarkable. Very few people openly endorse any of these beliefs today. And this is just a single example of a radical moral shift over time. If we look to other societies and countries, and look deeper into antiquity, the fact of moral change seems undeniable. This should encourage greater humility and uncertainty when it comes to our commitment to our currently favoured set of axiological possibilities...
>
> ... The second reason is that, in the full scope of human history and cultural variation, the centrality of individualism to our axiological worldview is a relatively recent, and somewhat localised development. In his history of European moral philosophy, The Invention of Autonomy (1998), JB Schneewind carefully and meticulously documents how the current Western commitment to the moral importance of the individual is something that evolved slowly, over the course of several centuries, not something that was always present. Larry Siedentop, in his book Inventing the Individual tells a similar story, describing in particular how Ancient (pre-Socratic) Greek societies did not place the individual at the centre of their morality, instead giving pride of place to the family and the state. These are not unfamiliar worldviews to us even today: various forms of nationalism and communitarianism still strive for our attention. Furthermore, there is at least one major world religion—Buddhism—which is known to favour the view that there is no self in the sense traditionally conceived by Western individualist thought (Flanagan 2017), and which sees the denial of the self as a pathway to Enlightenment. Although there are different interpretations of exactly what the ‘No Self’ doctrine means, Monima Chadha argues that one leading version of it (the Abhidharma tradition) rejects both the idea of an extended narrative self and a self with any degree of agency and ownership over its actions (Chadha 2017 & 2018). All of these examples suggest that humans are not welded to an individualistic ethos, and so we should be at least open to the possibility of axiological alternatives to individualism...
>
> 4. Why the Hivemind is Desirable
>
> ... ‘Desirability’ must be interpreted appropriately. There is a danger that we impose too high an axiological standard on the hivemind society and so rule it out of bounds forever. This could happen if we insist that, in order for it to be desirable, the hivemind society must satisfy important human goods or values and must not sacrifice or undermine any other goods or values. This would be an unfair standard. After all, no way of life that is currently deemed desirable meets that standard. Every choice we make involves compromises and tradeoffs. In choosing to be a committed and doting parent, you may have to sacrifice some success in your career. We might prefer it if such compromises could be avoided—and perhaps there are ways to reform social institutions so as to minimise them—but given both finite time and finite resources, some degree of compromise in seeking the good life is inevitable. The same will, necessarily, be true if we favour the hivemind over a more individualistic mode of existence. This does not mean that the hivemind is not desirable. It is enough if we can show that pursuing this ideal satisfies some goods and compensates for significant losses. With that clarification out of the way, we can proceed to the argument we wish to defend, which consists of four distinct sub-arguments in favour of the transition to the hivemind society.
>
> The **first** sub-argument has to do with the good of intimacy. Achieving an intimate connection with another human being is generally thought to be a core part of the well-lived life. The Aristotelian virtue of friendship, for example, celebrates a bond between friends that involves two people engaging with each other with near-perfect equality and mutuality. Similarly, the ideal of romantic attachment is typically thought to require strong forms of physical and mental mutuality. Our current physical and mental separateness prevents us from achieving near perfect intimacy. There is always some barrier between us. Even in the case of sexual intimacy—where there is some ‘melting’ of the physical barriers—the mental barriers remain... Building the hivemind society, particularly by following the path to high degrees of phenomenological unity, would provide an obvious means for overcoming the mental barriers between us and achieving a more perfected form of intimacy. Furthermore, this is an ideal that could be achieved at different scales and in different forms, depending on both the number of people with whom one forms a hivemind, and the degree of phenomenological sharing it entails.
>
> One might object to this on the grounds that intimacy requires separateness. In other words, one might argue that in order for someone to be intimate with another person, that person and the other person must retain their separate identities. Indeed, it could be that this is what makes intimacy good in the first place. It is like a form of phenomenological ‘edging’: we must be brought to the precipice of complete merger with another but never fall over the edge. The worry might be that the hivemind ideal thrusts us into the abyss. We no longer retain the separateness that makes intimacy such an ecstasy. Two things can be said in response to this. First, for hiveminds in the broad sense, pursuing the hivemind ideal need not undermine the separateness of individuals. It could itself just be an extreme form of phenomenological edging: humans in hiveminds might still retain some sense of individuality, but this is suppressed or dominated by the sense of merger. Second, even if it does undermine separateness, it is at least disputable as to why this separateness is essential to the good of intimacy. When we talk about achieving intimacy with another we usually focus on melting the boundaries between us, i.e. on trying to peer beneath the exterior mask and get at the person’s true identity. Pursuing that ideal to its logical extreme leads us to the narrow hivemind model. There is nothing in the inner logic of intimacy that rules this out.
>
> The **second** sub-argument has to do with problem-solving and goal achievement. Both of these things are thought to be a core part of the good life... achievement is only a good if the goals or ends pursued themselves have value, i.e. that the states of affairs brought about through problem-solving and achievement enable us to flourish and thrive. The success of modern, industrialised societies is built on the back of its immense problem-solving capacity, particularly in how we harness energy toward the production of food, clothing, shelter, entertainment and culture. It has long been known that individual humans are not that impressive when it comes to their problem-solving and goal achievement abilities... Humans depend on the existence of a ‘group mind’—a cultural repository of tools, techniques and tricks—to survive. Henrich documents this at length giving numerous examples of how important ‘collective intelligence’ is to human flourishing. What’s more, it seems like collective intelligence is becoming more and more important to our flourishing in the modern era. Numerous studies suggest that our capacity for research and innovation is subject to diminishing marginal returns. We see this very clearly in the sciences. Where once a lone genius could make radical breakthroughs and define an entire field of study, we now require large interdisciplinary and international research teams to make the breakthroughs. Indeed, modern scientific papers frequently seem to require what Daniel Dennett calls “distributed comprehension”, in which no one person understands the entirety of the paper. What all of this means is that achieving greater degrees of rational unity across a human population has always been essential to our survival and flourishing and has become more essential now. This, again, provides support for the hivemind idea, particularly in its rational unity form. If we want to achieve things through our actions -- for example, maintain the same levels of material wealth and success in the future -- and if we want to retain our problem-solving, achievement-oriented society, stronger degrees of rational unity will be required, up to and including degrees that deserve the label ‘hivemind’... the hivemind ideal may, in any event, be compatible with some lingering individualism that allows for individuals to experience some degree of satisfaction and accrue some benefit from problem-solving and goal achievement. Even if these experiences are not had by an individual human, and instead belong to a collective mind or agent, there is still some value to them: it is still good for certain goals to be achieved and associated experiences to be experienced, irrespective of who exactly is experiencing and achieving the goals...
>
> The **third** sub-argument takes a more direct aim at the citadel of individualism and argues that we should favour the hivemind because our commitment to individualism actually undermines truly moral and virtuous behaviour. Impartiality, altruism and selflessness are all usually taken to be hallmarks of moral behaviour. Indeed, a key desideratum in many metaethical theories is the extent to which they warrant impartiality in decision-making... Individualism is an impediment to impartiality. Individualism favours partiality, self-serving bias, and illusions of responsibility and virtue. It is because so many of us are trapped inside an individualistic bubble that we cannot act with true impartiality. Derek Parfit argues that our belief that we are separate, persistently existing individuals is, to a large extent, a conventional illusion, not a deep metaphysical truth. If we cast off the illusion we can live more open, altruistic lives... Parfit echoes millennia of Buddhist thought, which also emphasises the profound universal empathy that is possible through self-abandonment. In addition to believing that it is a fact that there is no separate, unique, narrative self, members of the Abhidharma Buddhist tradition also think that there are good practical, moral reasons for rejecting an individualistic ethos. As Chadha puts it, they argue that attachment to an individualistic view opens us up to certain “moral defilements” including “greed, conceit, pride, jealousy and so on”. We can rid ourselves of these defilements if we loosen the grip of individualism. Furthermore, it is claimed by members of this tradition that our belief in individualism is a source of much of our personal anxiety and suffering. Again, pursuing the hivemind ideal, in both of its forms, would help us to shatter the illusion of independent selfhood and live a more altruistic and enlightened life in the sense that eliminating the distinctions between different agents, and seeing everyone as part of a single unified hivemind, would be to achieve a perfected form of impartial altruism. It is important that this third sub-argument be fairly interpreted. Staunch anti-individualists and proponents of the No-Self doctrine may push the point too far. While it is undoubtedly true that our commitment to individualism is a source of some moral vice and defilement, it is also a source of moral virtue and good (e.g. responsibility, care, duty, courage, charity and so on). A person who is content with the ‘illusion’ of individualism can live a good life. The more modest, and in our view more reasonable, interpretation of the argument is simply to say that individualism is not the only game in town and that there are moral and flourishing modes of existence that are in tension with that paradigm and are best achieved by escaping from it. That is what is made evident by this third sub-argument...
>
> The **fourth** and final sub-argument in favour of the hivemind ideal is that pursuing that ideal is both compatible with, and possibly more conducive to, certain understandings of what it takes to live a meaningful life. This is an argument that has been made by Baptiste Le Bihan in relation to the Buddhist No-Self doctrine. As he notes, a typical reaction to that doctrine among Western thinkers is to argue that it lends itself to a form of nihilism. If the self does not exist, then what is the point of living? Life is only worthwhile if we, as individuals, live meaningful lives. But, as Le Bihan points out, there is nothing in traditional conceptions of what it takes to live a meaningful life that necessitates individualism. The one exception to this might be certain traditional religious understandings of meaning which insist upon the existence of a separate eternal soul in order for there to be meaning, but this is not a feature of all religious traditions and once you move to more secular understandings of meaning things become much more hospitable to anti-individualist views. The dominant secular understandings of meaning tend to be either subjectivist, objectivist or hybridist in nature (Metz 2013; Danaher 2014 & 2017; Campbell and Nyholm 2015). They claim that in order to live a meaningful life you must either (a) experience some subjective state of well-being (e.g. desire satisfaction or pleasure); or (b) bring about certain objectively valuable states of affairs (e.g. do good, find truth, create beauty); or (c) satisfy some combination of both subjective and objective states (e.g. be subjectively fulfilled by finding out the truth). At first glance, it might seem like each of these theories presupposes or requires the existence of a single self who experiences the relevant subjective states or brings about the relevant objective ends, but this is not necessarily true. There is nothing in subjectivism that insists that subjective pleasure must be felt by a unique, separate and persistent individual, and there is nothing in objectivism that insists that valuable ends must be brought about by a single individual. A collective agent, with high degrees of rational and phenomenological unity could satisfy these conditions of meaning too... Consequently, it is possible to pursue the hivemind ideal without giving up on living a meaningful life—the ideal is compatible with bringing about subjective pleasure and producing objectively valuable ends. It might even be better than this. There are certain conceptions of meaning in life that are not only compatible with the hivemind ideal but are actually only possible if we pursue it. For example, a common motif in theories of meaning is that a meaningful life is one that contributes to projects or ideals that are beyond that of the individual. The classic version of this is the religious ideal of contributing to God’s universal plan for salvation. One of the more unique secular variations of this ideal comes from Robert Nozick. Nozick argues that meaning comes from transcending our natural limits, where this requires some connection with larger external things. Nozick argues that there are two ways of forging this connection. You can connect with something that always remains external to you or you can integrate yourself with the external thing, forging some larger organic unity. He thinks the latter strategy is particularly conducive to meaning: it makes us fit as part of a larger pattern. Again, Le Bihan notes that this provides a lot of hope for the proponent of the No Self doctrine because they seek to erase the boundary between the individual human being and the external world. It also provides a lot of hope for the proponent of the hivemind ideal. After all, what is that ideal if not an attempt to transcend the limits of an individual human body and integrate it within a larger collective unit? Stepping away from this somewhat mystical doctrine, there is also the common motif that death and the fragility of human life somehow undermines or compromises meaning. Even among avowed naturalists, there is a belief that death makes life less meaningful and at the very least a longer lifespan would be more desirable... Perhaps by dissolving the individual and incorporating it into a larger collective agent, we have a more practical route to a longer life? After all, we already know that corporate agents can long outlive their original founders and managers. If we can make ourselves genuinely integrated parts of a unified collective entity we could participate in an extended, possibly even immortal lifespan. This is one thing that the hivemind ideal promises that is not as readily available to individuals...

So the next stage of evolution could be humanity beginning to link together—physically and mentally, beginning to work and function on many different levels as an integrated system." - [Peter Russell](https://www.organism.earth/library/document/global-brain#:~:text=We%20are%20beginning%20to%20share,levels%20as%20an%20integrated%20system.)

Reclaiming and directing attention

> "We need a system where urgent local news can be collected and amplified globally when necessary, and where the people of the world decide which news is important, not official news channels or celebrity nodes." - [Binding Chaos, by Heather Marsh](https://georgiebc.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/bindingchaos6x9.pdf)

> "If news requires no action, it is probably not the news we require in order to govern ourselves. If activism requires no analysis, it is probably not informed or effective." - [Heather Marsh](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10158316-if-news-requires-no-action-it-is-probably-not-the)

> "Problems of scarcity are fundamentally addressed by economics, which is the study of how scarce resources can be allocated most efficiently. At the most basic level, “economy” means simply the careful management of resources, so that as little as possible is wasted. From this point of view, **individuals should learn to optimally spend the limited amount of attention they have, by investing it only in the most worthwhile items.**" - [Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-overload.pdf)




## Attention Filtering - The End of Direct, Untrusted Information to Brain

> "Reading a tweet is a bit like downloading an (attacker-controlled) executable that you instantly run on your brain. Each one elicits emotions, suggests knowledge, nudges world-view. In the future it might feel surprising that we allowed direct, untrusted information to brain." - [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1766509149297189274)

> "In an ideal world, before I consume your content and allow your meme to pass through my brain, I should be able to configure my code to require that your packet meets certain provenance requirements. You don’t get my attention unless it meets that. It’s an implicit contractual protocol for attention." - [Peter Wang](https://github.com/pzwang/lostweb/blob/master/4%20The%20Root%20Problems.md)

information overload, decision-support, relevance, recommendations, collective feedback, causal networks, prediction and reaction

> "Such a global brain would **solve the problem of information overload at the most fundamental level. For the individual it would provide constant decision-support, presenting recommended choices in their apparent order of importance, as determined by the individual’s own preferences, the experience of all other agents, and the collective preferences of society.** Complemented by an in-depth teaching and implementation of the rules of information hygiene, such a system should be able to eliminate the stress of of not being able to cope with the number of available options, while minimizing the risk of bad decisions because of insufficient information being taken into account.
>
> Depending on the amount of attention or effort the individual is willing to invest in the decision, (s)he could either immediately accept the “default” recommendation, or examine a variable number of options in more depth, making a choice that is potentially very different from the one initially recommended by the system... The degree to which individuals actively participate in the decision-making will moreover depend on their own level of education and intelligence. **The smarter and the more experienced in the domain you are, the higher your chances to find a solution that is better than the default one, and the more the system can learn from your contribution. Thus, individual advances in knowledge and intelligence will directly or indirectly benefit the capacities of the collective.**
>
> On the level of society, **a global brain-like system should be able to tackle the problems associated with the complexity and sensitivity of causal networks. It should be able to take into account myriad events and their interactions, and intervene immediately, before any problem can snowball out of control.** Of course, even an intelligence of this supra-human order of magnitude will never be able to reliably predict the future behavior of a system that is in essence chaotic. Yet, **as cybernetics has taught us, detailed prediction (feedforward) is not necessary as long as the regulatory system can react quickly and adequately to any potentially dangerous perturbation (feedback).** Moreover, by modelling the effects of complex interactions such a system should be able to solve the productivity paradox, overcoming the socio-institutional inertia, the non-linear side-effects and bottlenecks that hold back productivity growth." - [Tackling Complexity and Information Overload: intelligence amplification, attention economy and the global brain, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/Info-overload.pdf)

## Designing self-regulation of attention

Aiding self-organizing communities of knowledge with better analysis (clustering, hubs, average distances). Detect what's currently most authoritative and what might be in the future. Consciously guide and influence the direction of the emergent self-regulation.

> "The emergence of a new scientific domain is a good example of the self-organization of such a community of knowledge, where people from initially diverse backgrounds find each other around a common interest, which gradually coalesces into a new paradigm. This process could be observed by mapping the network of authors, publications and keywords in a particular domain at regular intervals (e.g. every 2-5 years), and analyzing it in terms of clustering, hubs, average distances, etc. The change of these features over time may show processes of self-organization taking place. A good theory of the self-organization of knowledge communities would propose a number of processes and parameters that allow us to predict where, when and how such self-organization is most likely to take place. Such a theory would help us to find not only the presently most authoritative concepts, publications or authors (hubs), but those that are likely to become so in the future. This would provide a very powerful instrument to uncover emerging trends and to direct attention and investment towards the most promising people, ideas and information sources.

> ... While we cannot truly control a complex system, it tends to self-organize to a state where it regulates itself. This state tends to increase the utility or fitness of the system’s active components or agents, by coordinating their interactions so as to maximize synergy. The resulting organization is distributed over all the agents and their interactions, and thus much more robust and flexible than any centralized design. Moreover, it determines a number of emergent, global properties that cannot be reduced to the properties of the individual components. By understanding the underlying mechanisms, we may be able to facilitate and stimulate such self-organization, or to drive it in one direction rather than another." - [Complexity and Self-organization, by Francis Heylighen](http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/ELIS-complexity.pdf)
