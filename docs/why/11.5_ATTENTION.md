> "Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system." - [Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/)

Is it a coincidence that one of the most important papers in AI/ML that introduced transformers was called `"Attention is all you need"`?

> "Your periodic reminder that attention is power, and you should only give your attention to people or events you wish to empower. Attention drives intention, intention drives action, action creates your world." - [Emmett Shear](https://x.com/eshear/status/1900321229489529138)

The importance of attention cannot be overstated


Facebook is a government with a monopoly not on violence but on attention and they are unaccountable to anyone for who or what they put in attention jail

Our attentional arteries

Predatory tactics: inserting irrelevant entries along with search results with the aim of engagement

Attention has a cost - an opportunity cost. It is a resource and hence we "pay" attention
It also takes energy to process information and energy is just a resource as well


awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.
The phantom limb sensation is when the model is still operating according to the past - but the limb no longer exists. We still register the physical limb as present.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb


Humanity lacks a cohesive subjective awareness as a schematic model of itself - we lack an attention schema. We can't:
- control our attention
- model the attention of others and different groups of people

> ... These reward stimuli affect our minds whenever we look at our phones. As a result, we’re being programmed to expect and desire a very unnatural state of immediacy. Compare this with how the brains of our species — which evolved in the material world — until very recently made use of our neuro-modulator-based psychological reward system. That system was called on far, far less frequently — certainly, not constantly.
>
> ... Today, things are different. We reach for our phones the instant the plane lands — or when we have 15 seconds of downtime in the grocery checkout line — not because our lives are so insanely fast that something actually needs our ATTENTION RIGHT NOW, but because we have been nonconsciously programmed to experience a neuromodulator reward whenever we take out our phone and get an inbound update, text message, email, or like. The same thing happens when we gain a false sense of “having found something useful” by scanning the news for what’s happening right this very minute with the dramatic political absurdities gripping our country.

> ... In short, the instincts of our social hunter-gatherer brains — to seek social interaction and be constantly scanning the environment for food and sources of danger — have been co-opted to instead hook us on yet another like or incoming text message about something that is usually trivial, or is otherwise consciously designed (with the help of cutting-edge cognitive science) to manipulate us.

> "We have a really hard time distinguishing between “having attention” and “deserving attention;”
>
> ... When we look at our hardwired “attention allocation” functions, we discover that human beings use a pretty simple model: pay attention to the people who other people are paying attention to.
>
> ... As a society, we are obsessed with who has attention, and conspicuously less interested in whether it is deserved. Among many things, this deficit leads to the cultural consequence of “celebrity”. Since having attention is hard to separate from deserving attention, simply having the camera pointing at you implicitly confers upon you some of the power and credentials of authority. This is why we find ourselves in the situation where Hollywood entertainers and professional athletes are empowered to steward good opinion far beyond their actual expertise.
>
> ... In a broadcast world, merely being “on camera” is to be credentialed.

opportunity costs of everyone's attention locked into the same things
- friends & family
- our professions
- system accountability
don't include the video but think about these things

How do we make a system where really egregious things don't have to become top of mind for everyone just to have them fixed? What if we could let people rank the importance of events, such that the need for a response is determined by importance, but even if something is important, if it is outside of my area of expertise that I don't have to even hear about it, and yet still there to be an incentive to actually identify really important things and have them fixed? What if those ranking the importance of events were on the hook for not accurately ranking the importance of something retroactively?
what if there were 2 types of importance signals: normal importance and one relevant to fraud for the system itself? what if we only drew attention to everyone (even those who can't do anything about it) only for fraud in the system of incentives?





> "They amplify the output of each individual, choosing broadcast by default. These apps don’t encourage individuals to explicitly address an audience... These antisocial defaults are by design. Social Media incentivizes individuals to produce as much content as possible, so that others get inundated and must use some type of filter. By intermediating every conversation, they gain an enormous amount of power." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627#:~:text=They%20amplify%20the,amount%20of%20power.)

> "For groups of people and society at large, what we actually have is an amplification problem.
>
> Amplification, at the scale we’ve achieved in modern society, creates a bulk scarcity of attention. That is actually the hard limit that is driving a sense of “censorship” when e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Youtube decide to “de-platform” someone. We are now so used to an amplified media environment (ShoutBox), that the lack of amplification is equated to actual censorship.
>
> Thus, the historical principle enshrined in “freedom of the press” has now morphed into “access to amplification”. But since all the routes from pixel to eyeball are owned by private carriers (Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.), revocation of this access is total and absolute, and utterly controlled by private actors. Almost no corporate actor by itself has a total monopoly on broadcast and distribution, but taken together, the telecom+social media companies form a cartel whose control over attention is nearly absolute." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "A group’s attention becomes more scarce as it becomes more synchronized. In the business world, we all know that having too many meetings literally kills bandwidth to get anything done. But the same is true of any human organization, including the entirety of society.
>
> We must view individual attention as a societal good; and we should see society-wide “joint attention” as, in fact, a Commons, like fresh air or clean water. But unlike air or water, synchronous attention is a manufactured scarcity.
>
> Anyone who has ever been in a position of leadership knows how critically important it is for a group to “know a thing”, and to “know that everyone knows”. In a business, this could be the corporate mission or quarterly goals. It’s why we have regular status meetings to “get everyone on the same page”.
>
> A society is no different. Prior to Internet, we relied on broadcast technologies to be a memetic metronome, and to set a cadence of sense-making and norm-reinforcement for a very large and diverse tribe. The decoherence of this joint-attention erodes foundational intersubjective beliefs, and destroys society by allowing individuals to “spin off” into a thousand diverse little subjectivities.
>
> In the current environment of information warfare and accelerated fracturing into memetic tribes, how we apportion control over this Commons is the single most important question facing every country. This principle — that the sense-making environment should be a socially-governed Commons — is a new one. It is only apparent now, because tech has gotten so powerful that it can flood and clog the information environment at such massive scale.
>
> It is on this principle that we can establish a modernized version of the Fairness Doctrine, which strives to define a healthy information diet for all citizens. Furthermore, by recognizing that synchronicity is a key aspect of memetic power, tech companies may be able to engineer better solutions to balance amplification while mitigating potential harm, by modeling the temporal availability and spread of a particular piece of content." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "Attention is one of the most fundamental components of a conscious identity. When something hijacks or manipulates a person’s attention, it’s actively eroding their independent self-hood as a conscious individual. The giving and the receiving of attention are both intimate acts. These acts are the very basis of all human communications, and by extension, human societies. Any tools or technologies that mediate this act need to be designed with great care." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

> "McLuhan famously declared that “the medium is the message”. But few seem to recognize that Social Media isn’t a “medium” in any traditional sense. Because it transmits and amplifies different content in variable ways, responding to the content itself, it is an active participant. If it was merely a constant, static amplification, then we could apply our traditional tools for assessing accountability and limiting harm. These include libel laws and the (now-repealed) Fairness Doctrine.
>
> This variable amplification at the heart of “viral” social media isn’t an accident or a software bug. It is a necessary component of driving engagement for their business model. It creates a “Lottery of Fame” for every post, every image. Instead of everyone getting their 15 minutes of fame, social media apps seduce you with the possibility of getting 15 seconds of micro-fame: You could be an influencer, reaching millions, trending in the sidebar! This hijacks our primate-level desire for status. It’s especially toxic for young users, who become aware of status games among peers at a very early age.
>
> Social media apps mine attention from captive masses, and mint it into social capital. We are training entire generations of youth to treat their phones as digital slot machines — “One-finger bandits” that use dynamic amplification to provide the possibility of “going viral” to keep people swiping. This “manufactured scarcity” in social media is actually a specific instance of the broader principle around network effects, brilliantly articulated in this essay/podcast by James Currier and Eugene Wei: Status Games: Engineering Scarcity in a World of Abundance." - [Reframing the “Social Media” Problem As an Attention Crisis, by Peter Wang](https://medium.com/@pwang/reframing-the-social-media-problem-as-an-attention-crisis-52253dbfe627)

## Attention Schema Theory (AST)

Michael Graziano - A Conceptual Framework for Consciousness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDBYAJ1oUw

> "Awareness is the brain's way of describing to itself what it means to focus attention on something." - [Michael Graziano](https://youtu.be/H8twgvcA-Ko?t=349)

> "The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’ ... The heart of the attention schema theory is that there is an adaptive value for a brain to build the construct of awareness: it serves as a model of attention... The attention schema theory accounts in a natural way for one of the most puzzling and mysterious aspects of awareness, the fact that we can become aware of both external and internal events.
>
> ... The ‘biased competition’ theory characterizes attention as a signal competition within the brain. Signals compete in order to be more deeply processed and ultimately to influence and guide behavior. This signal competition emerges at the earliest stages of processing in the nervous system and is present at every stage... As signals progress through the nervous system, they are increasingly subject to the influence of top–down, biasing signals. By this method, attention can be internally directed, slanting the outcome of this signal competition in a goal-directed manner based on the demands of the current task. Signals that correspond to current goals can be boosted and irrelevant signals can be suppressed.
>
> ... The body schema appears to be a simplified, and therefore sometimes inaccurate, model of the body’s configuration. Converging evidence from both psychology and neurophysiology suggests that the brain relies on a set of relatively robust, but ultimately limited, tricks in order to compute the configuration of the body. Though these tricks tend to work well under normal circumstances, laboratory scenarios can be devised that result in the dissociation of the body schema and the actual configuration of the body... To enter a car without hitting your head requires the body schema to include an accurate model of the shape of your head. Women who wore feathered hats would develop an altered body schema to incorporate the hat, and would avoid hitting the feathers.
>
> ... We argue that this relationship – between a real thing, the brain’s representation of that thing, and the successful control of that thing – can be fruitfully applied to understanding the relationship between attention and awareness. In this perspective, awareness is an internal model of attention useful for the control of attention.
>
> ... What you attend to, you are more likely to react to. What you do not attend to, you are very unlikely to react to. Therefore a model of attention could help in predicting one’s own behavior. For example, if you have any intuitive understanding of attention, of its dynamics and consequences for behavior, and if you are concerned about your diet, then you know not to stand all night next to the dessert tray at a party. Out of sight, out of mind – this maxim is essentially about the dynamics of attention.
>
> ... We argue that because attention is such a complex and variable process, because a brain must control its own attention, and because an internal model is essential for efficient control, the brain is almost certain to have an attention schema – an internal model of attention... The attention schema would not depict synapses, neurons, lateral inhibition, or electrochemical signals. The brain has no need to model its own processes in that kind of physical detail. Instead, the attention schema would depict something physically incoherent, a process without a physical manifestation – a mental possession or experience of something that empowers one to react to the item.
>
> ... Why would the brain compute such an incomplete model of its own processes? Because that is all that is needed for the model to be useful. Just as the body schema does not need to represent the mechanistic and cellular details of the body in order to keep track of its general structure and current configuration, a detailed, complete, neuroscientific account of attention is not necessary for keeping track of the current state and general dynamics of attention.
>
> ... Awareness is part of the control mechanism for attention. Without awareness, attention is still possible, but the brain in essence lacks knowledge about its state of attention and therefore cannot properly regulate that attention. If attention is directed at stimulus X in the absence of awareness of stimulus X, the brain has no internal knowledge that it is attending to X and therefore the control mechanism cannot easily withdraw that attention from X, or take that attention on X into account when adjusting attention to a different stimulus Y. As a result, the top–down control of attention to X, to Y, or to other stimuli is not as efficient. In that situation, stimulus X has a less well-controlled effect on behavior than it would otherwise... In the absence of awareness of a stimulus, the effects of that stimulus on attention and therefore on behavior cannot be regulated in line with goals or task demands as well as when the stimulus is consciously perceived... Things go on under the surface of consciousness. And in that condition, when you react unconsciously, you have no control over that reaction. It just pops out. How can you control it, if you’re not conscious of it? Everyone knows this to be true. It is intuitively obvious.

> ... It is folk psychology in which, with some circularity, consciousness is the thing in me that, when conscious of something, allows me to consciously choose how to react to that thing. The present theory provides a specific, underlying explanation for these common folk intuitions. At the root of these effects is awareness as a model of attention. Without awareness, without that model of attention, the control of attention and therefore of behavioral reaction is poor... It is tempting to conclude that attention is a universal feature of brain function, acting within and between any dimensions in which the brain can process information.

> ... The complex phenomenon of a stimulus being selectively processed by the brain, attention, is represented in a simplified model, an attention schema. This model leaves out many of the mechanistic details of the actual phenomenon of attention, and instead depicts a mysterious, physically impossible property – awareness. The brain reports the presence of awareness of the stimulus because it is reporting the contents of its internal models. The brain can report only the information available to it through its internal models." - [The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness, by Michael Graziano](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500/full)

Link between AST (attention schema theory) and ashby’s law - to control our attention we need a model of it
combining the capacity to build models and pay attention.
also how we should collectively control our collective attention schema and individually our individual algorithms

## Global Workspace Theory

> "Consciousness is like fame in the brain." - Daniel Denett

> "GWT analogizes the mind to a theater, with conscious thought being like material illuminated on the main stage. The brain contains many specialized processes or modules that operate in parallel, much of which is unconscious. Attention acts as a spotlight, bringing some of this unconscious activity into conscious awareness on the global workspace. The global workspace is a functional hub of broadcast and integration that allows information to be disseminated across modules. As such it can be classified as a functionalist theory of consciousness.
>
> When sensory input, memories, or internal representations are given attention, they become part of the global workspace and can then be operated on by a variety of processes. As elements compete for attention, the ones that win are granted entry to the global workspace, allowing their information to be distributed and coordinated across the whole cognitive system.
>
> GWT resembles the concept of working memory and is proposed to correspond to a 'momentarily active, subjectively experienced' event in working memory. It facilitates top-down control of attention, working memory, planning, and problem-solving through this information sharing.
>
> In the 'theater of consciousness', a 'spotlight of selective attention' shines a bright spot on stage, revealing the contents of consciousness. Behind the scenes, in the dark, are the director (executive processes), stagehands, scriptwriters, scene designers, and the like. They shape the visible activities in the bright spot but are themselves invisible.

> ...It serves as a central information exchange, rather than a locus of cognition itself, enabling different specialized brain networks to interact and supporting integrated and adaptive responses." - [Global workspace theory, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory#:~:text=GWT%20analogizes%20the,and%20adaptive%20responses.)
