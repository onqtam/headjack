> "Nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish cooperation of many individuals." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1170750-nothing-truly-valuable-can-be-achieved-except-by-the-unselfish)

> "The competition between the two forces can be succinctly expressed as follows: Within groups selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, but groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals. Or, risking oversimplification, individual selection promoted sin, while group selection promoted virtue." - [Edward O. Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3233345-the-competition-between-the-two-forces-can-be-succinctly-expressed)

^^ but altruism & group selection are not stable - we need consequence capture & managers
cooperation does not evolve easily


> "It’s bullshit. Indiscriminate altruism, untainted by vanity, reciprocity, or partiality, cannot evolve. It just can’t. I’m sorry. Any altruism that wasn't laser-focused toward our families or our allies, or that wasn’t otherwise shrewdly calculated to increase our status, would be mercilessly selected against by evolution. Darwinian accounting is scrupulous: debts must be repaid, costs must be cut, investments must be recouped." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20bullshit.%20Indiscriminate,must%20be%20recouped.)

> "The impartial, unreciprocated, non-status-boosting sacrifice for the greater good—cannot evolve. People really do not like this. They try to wriggle out of it in all sorts of frantic ways." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=the%20impartial%2C%20unreciprocated,of%20frantic%20ways.)

> "You don’t need a desire for moral progress to get moral progress, any more than you need a desire for traffic to get traffic. Here are some of the best, cynically Darwinian explanations I’ve seen for moral progress:
>
> 1. It’s a side-effect of capitalism.
>
> a) If you only sell stuff to members of your tribe, you’re not going to make as much money as someone who sells stuff to everyone. The same thing goes for consumers. If you only buy from your tribe, you’re going to get crappier stuff. Ditto for workers. If you only work for your tribe, you’ll get fewer job offers. And if you reward workers based on tribal loyalty, instead of productivity, you’ll get lower productivity, and less profit. That’s how all these WEIRD ideas about “meritocracy” and “treating people equally” emerged. They were self-interested strategies for buyers, sellers, workers, and employers. But once the capitalist pro-tip of “treating people equally” spread (and got written into the constitution), people started to look like hypocrites for not, you know, treating people equally. Low-status groups used the hypocrisy to rally people to their side in political conflicts.
>
> b) In a market economy, status accrues to those who are most successful in providing desirable goods and services at affordable prices. So when low-status groups enter the labor market in greater numbers, they rise in status. For example, at the turn of the 20th century, women entered the labor market in greater numbers. Why? Because with the rise of automation, there was a decline in manual labor that advantaged humans with greater upper body strength and no uteruses (i.e., men), and a rise in other kinds of service-based labor that women were good at. Women’s status, accordingly, rose. They began to leverage their rising status to advance their self-interest, as humans are wont to do. No, they weren’t seeking moral progress for everyone: the suffragists excluded African Americans from protests and didn’t like the idea of black men voting.
>
> 2. It’s a side-effect of communication technologies (itself a side-effect of capitalism):
>
> a) We didn’t evolve to estimate a group’s formidability based on census statistics; we evolved to estimate it based on how big and well-coordinated they look. To our stone-age brains, a marching minority looks bigger and stronger than it really is, as a percentage of the population. Transportation moves far-flung minorities into the same space to flex their muscles, and television transmits the image to everyone in the nation. When marginalized groups create the illusion of collective formidability, we no longer want to mess with them.
>
> b) When tribes start to become equally powerful, or start to appear equally powerful due to mass media, it creates an intergroup stalemate, a kind of mutually assured destruction. Hot wars turn into cold wars. Cold wars turn into culture wars.
>
> 3. It’s a side-effect of democracy (itself a side-effect of capitalism)
>
> a) When marginalized groups flex their muscles and win the right to vote, savvy politicians compete to attract their votes, and the coalition that recruits them gains political power. The partisans who find themselves in a political coalition with the marginalized groups start to look upon them with fondness. We like our allies—they’re on our team. So you get performative allyship and a decline of overt racism among whichever political coalition joins up with ethnic minorities. If that happens among cultural elites, who shape social norms, then you might get some new social norms about “political correctness” or “wokeness” or whatever you want to call it. And you might get a backlash to these norms among the elites’ political rivals (i.e., the working class “populists”).
>
> This is all very interesting, but don’t miss the point: moral progress was an accident. In fact, it must have been it accident, because our motives were designed by natural selection, and a motive for “moral progress” makes no evolutionary sense. Which means we shouldn’t feel too proud of ourselves. We’re the same old primates we always were—selfish, nepotistic, and groupish. We have the same capacity for evil, and the same capacity to rationalize it, as our forebears." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20need,as%20our%20forebears.)

> "I'm saying it's more insightful, useful, and predictively powerful to focus on the deeper goal, because that is the lever we must pull if we want to shape the behavior, and that is the key to understanding and predicting when and where the behavior will be performed. We must choose insight over idealism." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/darwin-the-cynic?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=42426004)

> "I don’t think it really matters whether the motive is conscious or not. Worldviews help us predict and explain people’s behavior. That’s their job. If I’m trying to predict and explain behavior, cynicism is going to help me do that, regardless of whether the cynical motives are conscious or not. It doesn’t matter why people *think* they’re donating to charity. What matters is why they are *actually* donating to charity—the specific causal factors that are influencing their decision. Those factors are inevitably going to be reputational, status-driven, nepotistic, reciprocal, and/ or groupish in nature. If I’m trying to design institutions with incentives that promote charitable giving, I need to look at people’s *actual* motives, not the motives they say they have... Motives are the things that causally influence and explain our behavior across a range of situations, regardless of whether we’re aware of them or not. Motives (and psychological systems) are the things that natural selection selects—not behaviors. When you understand the process that created our motives, there is simply no other option than to say those motives are selfish, nepotistic, or groupish. If you can think of another way for a motive to evolve that doesn’t involve replicating the genes that built it, I’d love to hear it. But until then, I’m going with Darwinian cynicism as the best way to explain and predict people’s behavior." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/darwin-the-cynic?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=45901765)

As we shall see, sometimes the most selfish thing a gene can do is build a selfless brain.

The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy

In game theory, the price of stability (PoS) of a game is the ratio between the best objective function value of one of its equilibria and that of an optimal outcome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_stability

The concepts of price of anarchy and price of stability were introduced to capture the loss in performance of a system due to the selfish behavior of its participants. The price of anarchy captures the worst-case performance of the system at equilibrium relative to the optimal performance possible. The price of stability, on the other hand, captures the relative performance of the best equilibrium of the system.

> "Take the case of academic publishing, given as a classic coordination failure by Eliezer Yudkowsky in Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck. Academic journals publish research within a given field and charge for access to it, often at exorbitant rates. In order to get the best jobs and earn prestige within a field, researchers need to publish in the most respected journals. If they don’t, no one will take their work seriously.
>
> Academic publishing is broken in many ways. By charging high prices, journals limit the flow of knowledge and slow scientific progress. They do little to help researchers, instead profiting from the work of volunteers and taxpayer funding. Yet researchers continue to submit their work to them. Why? Because this is the Nash equilibrium. Although it would be better for science as a whole if everyone stopped publishing in journals that charge for access, it isn’t in the interests of any individual scientist to do so. If they did, their career would suffer and most likely end. The only solution would be a coordinated effort for everyone to move away from journals. But seeing as this is so difficult to organize, the farce of academic publishing continues, harming everyone except the journals." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=Take%20the%20case,except%20the%20journals.)

> "It’s possible to change things on a large scale if we are able to communicate on a much greater scale. When everyone knows that everyone knows, changing what we do is much easier.
>
> We all act out of self-interest, so expecting individuals to risk the costs of going against convention is usually unreasonable. Yet it only takes a small proportion of people to change their opinions to reach a tipping point where there is strong incentive for everyone to change their behavior, and this is magnified even more if those people have a high degree of influence. The more power those who enact change have, the faster everyone else can do the same.
>
> To overcome coordination failures, we need to be able to communicate despite our differences. And we need to be able to trust that when we act, others will act too. The initial kick can be enough people making their actions visible. Groups can have exponentially greater impacts than individuals. We thus need to think beyond the impact of our own actions and consider what will happen when we act as part of a group." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20possible%20to,of%20a%20group.)

People go all-in on these weird subcultures with plausible but false values. They think that if they push deeper into the aesthetic, it will give them somewhere to belong. But it doesn’t work, so they go even harder.

If your value instincts are good, the world rewards you with power and life. If you make the wrong bets on what to do with your life, you end up unsuccessful or dead. If someone else can influence your values for their own purposes, you can end up slaving your life away for something that has nothing to do with your own real interests. I think this is what happened to my friends, and what is happening to many of you.
>
> The self-destructive lifestyles that take our friends don’t just happen spontaneously; they are ideological subcultures sustained by the activities they teach. The parties bring in new people, the drugs are a sort of initiation, the clothes are a uniform that identifies you as bought in, and the music and media supply a steady stream of ideals and ingroup perspective. Even diets serve as ingroup markers and separate you from outsiders.
>
> The resulting alienation from friends and family removes you from countervailing influences. All of these contribute to the social reproduction of the subculture and whatever values it teaches. If a lifestyle of partying, drugs, and alienation finally turns deadly, that’s fine as long as the average participant has by that point initiated enough new blood to sustain that lifestyle. When I’ve tried to talk to people who are on these paths, their answers are bizarre. They think it’s all good for them, and anyone questioning it is an enemy. It’s like talking to someone in a cult.

> Likewise, behind the anxieties that drive America’s upper middle class are the employers, schools, lifestyle brands, and political causes that are only too happy to feed those fears. As soon as you get too much of your social perspective from the society you live in, you are in danger. Whatever institutions can get your ear will teach you whatever values most efficiently motivate you for their own purposes. They’ll gladly feed you suggestions that have nothing to do with your own real interests, as long as it’s useful to them to do so. It would be too real to pay you in actual power, actual freedom, and actual vitality, so instead you’ll be taught to accept payment in slavecoin.

> Slavecoin is anything that is apparently valuable from inside the spectacle, but in fact, offers no possible independence from it, and can’t be redeemed for hard vital power. Slavecoin is fake in its substance: think of all the prestige, credentials, career attainment, identity validation, pleasures, luxuries, and financialized wealth that no longer buys power. These things seem valuable and have extensive social narratives backing them up. But when viewed skeptically from outside the system, there is much less substance there than the trusted social consensus would lead you to think.

It contains not just bets on what is most important, but also all the practical life wisdom that supports and implements those values, and defensive responses to the various counterarguments life and critics will throw at you. This is too big for you to produce by yourself. It is too big to even maintain by yourself. Like any other product of industry, a sane social perspective requires an extensive and trustworthy supply chain of information, ideas, and values bringing together the work of many other people.

No matter how hard you try to be rational, you simply lack the logistical backing necessary for precision. Your social ideas will be crude and misfocused...
>
> The obvious solution is to rebuild real social fabric, or otherwise systematically provision trustworthy social perspective. This is easier said than done, but not exactly new technology either. Many churches pull off partial solutions every day, and we all have our networks of trusted friends. Besides, a large amount of power is sitting on the table for whoever can do it properly.
>
> The real problem is that there are many powerful and wealthy institutions in our society invested in the lies that keep people working for false value. Slavecoin is big business. Any effort to rebuild trustworthy social perspective would very quickly threaten these lies and thus find powerful enemies in these groups...

> Abraham rejected the cults and their false and unnatural values. Instead of valuing the socially constructed and overly entangled values of the societies around him, Abraham expected a reward in the values natural to living existence.

I will give them a great land, taken from those who sin against me. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you. Through you, all the peoples of the earth will be blessed.”

# SECTION: Make "Ought" Great Again
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "In the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance).
>
> Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations.
>
> ...
>
> Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate.
>
> We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.
>
> Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next – and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want. Some philosophers confine the term ‘moral’ to problems about how one should treat other people. But such problems are continuous with problems of individuals choosing what sort of life to lead, which is why I adopt the more inclusive definition. Terminology aside, if you were suddenly the last human on Earth, you would be wondering what sort of life to want. Deciding ‘I should do whatever pleases me most’ would give you very little clue, because what pleases you depends on your moral judgement of what constitutes a good life, not vice versa.
>
> This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. Trying to do so is the project of the influential moral philosophy known as utili tarianism, which played much the same role as empiricism did in the philosophy of science: it acted as a liberating focus for the rebellion against traditional dogmas, while its own positive content contained little truth.
>
> So there is no avoiding what-to-do-next problems, and, since the distinction between right and wrong appears in our best explanations that address such problems, we must regard that distinction as real. In other words, there is an objective difference between right and wrong: those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours...
>
> Beauty, right and wrong, primality, infinite sets – they all exist objectively. But not physically. What does that mean? Certainly they can affect you – as examples like Hofstadter’s show – but apparently not in the same sense that physical objects do. You cannot trip over one of them in the street. However, there is less to that distinction than our empiricism-biased common sense assumes. First of all, being affected by a physical object means that something about the physical object has caused a change, via the laws of physics (or, equivalently, that the laws of physics have caused a change via that object). But causation and the laws of physics are not themselves physical objects. They are abstractions, and our knowledge of them comes – just as for all other abstractions – from the fact that our best explanations invoke them. Progress depends on explanation, and therefore trying to conceive of the world as merely a sequence of events with unexplained regularities would entail giving up on progress." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

This theory describes the predictable emergence of higher levels of organization and control through transitions that he calls metasystem transitions, which involve independent systems coming together to form metasystems (systems made of systems). The emergence of life, multicellularity, and societies all represent major metasystem transitions, which were called major evolutionary transitions in the field of evolutionary biology. He argued that each of these transitions represents a qualitative shift in the complexity and organization of the system, with the higher-level system exhibiting properties and behaviors that cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts.

> Turchin’s theory and Teilhard de Chardin’s are basically one and the same, and make similar predictions for human civilization, but Turchin brings the science of cybernetics into the picture, which is the field of study that understands how systems use feedback processes to maintain a stable state of dynamic equilibrium, adapt, grow, and exercise control.
>
> According to Turchin’s theory, as societies evolve, they undergo periodic transitions that result in the creation of new, more complex systems that integrate and supersede the previous ones. These transitions are driven by the accumulation of knowledge, the development of new technologies, and the resolution of conflicts between competing interests. The agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the ongoing digital revolution can all be seen as examples of metasystem transitions.
>
> Based on his metasystem transition theory, Turchin made several predictions about the future evolution of human society and technology. He believed that humanity was on the cusp of a new metasystem transition, driven by the rapid advancement of information technology and artificial intelligence. He predicted that this transition would lead to the emergence of a global "superorganism" — a highly integrated and interconnected network of humans and machines that would exhibit collective intelligence and behavior. This idea is essentially indistinguishable from Teilhard de Chardin’s noosphere.
>
> Turchin also envisioned the development of advanced forms of artificial intelligence that would be capable of self-improvement and recursive self-modification. He argued that this could potentially lead to an "intelligence explosion," where AI systems would rapidly surpass human intelligence and transform the nature of civilization itself. This prediction has much in common with Kurzweil’s law of accelerating returns, and represents an early vision of the technological singularity.
>
> By applying these three laws in conjunction, we can begin to envision a future in which human civilization becomes increasingly interconnected, increasingly integrated with our technology, and increasingly organized on a global scale. The law of accelerating returns suggests that we will continue to develop powerful new technologies at an exponential rate, while the law of complexification indicates that these technologies will enable us to form more intricate and interdependent networks of communication and collaboration. At the same time, metasystem transition theory implies that we may be on the verge of a major societal transition that could result in the emergence of a global society characterized by unprecedented levels of cooperation, innovation, and sustainability.
>
> If this is true, and metasystem transitions work like [phase transitions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037843710600402X), then there is always a period of chaos and instability during the transition, because that chaos creates the flexibility in the system needed for it to transition to a new configuration. This could explain all the global chaos we are seeing right now, with two major wars and growing ideological polarization and division around the world. Ironically, leaps to greater cooperation involve greater chaos. Systems “scream for change” before a a major leap in progress, and knowledge of this fact should be built into the logic of our future forecasting." - [How to Predict the Future: The Law of Complexification is Science's Crystal Ball, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/how-to-predict-the-future-the-law#:~:text=Turchin%20lays%20out,our%20future%20forecasting.)

It also depends on whether people are aware that other people also receive it.” According to Suk-Young Chwe, for people to coordinate on the basis of certain information it must be “common knowledge,” a phrase used here to mean “everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows it, and so on.” The more public and visible the change is, the better." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=As%20Michael%20Suk,is%2C%20the%20better.)

“Submitting to a social or political authority is a coordination problem - each person is more willing to support an authority the more others are willing to support it” - quote from “rational ritual” book



> "How do individuals coordinate their actions? Here we consider "coordination problems," in which each person wants to participate in a group action but only if others also participate. For example, each person might want to take part in an antigovernment protest but only if there are enough total protesters to make arrests and police repression unlikely. People most often "solve" coordination problems by communicating with each other. Simply receiving a message, however, is not enough to make an individual participate. Because each individual wants to participate only if others do, each person must also know that others received a message. For that matter, because each person knows that other people need to be confident that others will participate, each person must know that other people know that other people have received a message, and so forth. In other words, knowledge of the message is not enough; what is also required is knowledge of others' knowledge, knowledge of others' knowledge of others' knowledge, and so on-that is, "common knowledge." To understand how people solve coordination problems, we should thus look at social processes that generate common knowledge. The best examples turn out to be "public rituals," such as public ceremonies, rallies, and media events.
>
> Public rituals can thus be understood as social practices that generate common knowledge. For example, public ceremonies help maintain social integration and existing systems of authority; public rallies and demonstrations are also crucial in political and social change. Social integration and political change can both be understood as coordination problems; I am more likely to support an authority or social system, either existing or insurgent, the more others support it. Public rituals, rallies, and ceremonies generate the necessary common knowledge. A public ritual is not just about the transmission of meaning from a central source to each member of an audience; it is also about letting audience members know what other audience members know." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "I then look at examples of people facing each other in circles, as in the kiva, a ritual structure found in prehistoric structures in the southwestern United States, the seating configuration of various U.S. city halls, and revolutionary festivals during the French Revolution. In each of these examples, the circular form was seemingly intended to foster social unity. But how? Our explanation is based on common knowledge generation. An inward-facing circle allows maximum eye contact; each person knows that other people know because each person can visually verify that others are paying attention." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Buying certain kinds of goods can be a coordination problem; for example, a person might want to see a movie more the more popular it is. To get people to buy these "coordination problem" goods, an advertiser should try to generate common knowledge." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "To understand public rituals, one should understand how they generate the common knowledge that the logic of rationality requires. To understand how rational individuals solve coordination problems, one should understand public rituals." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Common knowledge depends not only on me knowing that you receive a message but also on the existence of a shared symbolic system which allows me to know how you understand it.
>
> Because common knowledge generation is important for coordinated action, it is something people fight over; for example, censorship typically cracks down hardest on public communications." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Common knowledge not only helps a group coordinate but also, to some extent, can create groups, collective identities, "imagined communities" in which, for example, each newspaper reader is aware of millions of fellow readers." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Successful communication sometimes is not simply a matter of whether a given message is received. It also depends on whether people are aware that other people also receive it. In other words, it is not just about people's knowledge of the message; it is also about people knowing that other people know about it, the "metaknowledge" of the message.

> Say that when our acquaintance yells, I see you raise your head and look around for me, but I'm not sure if you manage to find me. Even though I know about the yell, and I know that you know since I see you look up, I still decide to stay on the bus because I do not know that you know that I know. So just one "level" of metaknowledge is not enough.
>
> Taking this further, one soon realizes that every level of metaknowledge is necessary: I must know about the yell, you must know, I must know that you know, you must know that I know, I must know that you know that I know, and so on; that is, the yell must be "common knowledge." The term "common knowledge" is used in many ways but here we stick to a precise definition. We say that an event or fact is common knowledge among a group of people if everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows it, and so on. Two people can create these many levels of metaknowledge simply through eye contact: say that when our acquaintance yells I am looking at you and you are looking at me. Thus I know you know about the yell, you know that I know that you know (you see me looking at you), and so on. lf we do manage to make eye contact, we get off the bus; communication is successful." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Changing the size or taste of the loaves is not the same public event as raising its price." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "I should make clear that a coordination problem is not a "free rider problem," also known as the "prisoners' dilemma." In a free rider problem, no person wants to participate under any circumstances: each person always prefers to "free ride" on the participation of others. We all want to keep the common field green, for example, but everyone has an incentive to let his herd overgraze. "Solving" free rider problems hence requires enlarging people's possible motivations, by for example legal or social sanctions against free riders or repeated contexts in which free riding now might make people not cooperate with you later. "Solving" coordination problems, however, does not require changing peoples' motivations: when everyone cooperates, each person wants to do so because everyone else is. Although the term "collective action problem" is often used to refer only to free rider problems (Olson 1971), some argue that collective actions such as political protest are better described as coordination problems (e.g., Chong 1991; see also Moore 1995). Also, even when solving free rider problems via sanctions, for example, there is the "prior" coordination problem of getting people to participate in a system of sanctions, because usually a person wants to participate in sanctioning only if others do also." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "The evolution of cooperation is central to all living systems. Evolutionary history can be defined by a series of major transitions in which replicating units came together, lost their independence and formed new levels of biological organization. As a consequence, life is organized in a hierarchy of cooperation: genes work together in genomes, genomes in cells, cells in multicellular organisms and multicellular organisms in eusocial groups." - [Enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41559-019-0907-1)

> "We define enforcement as an action that evolves, at least in part, to reduce selfish behaviour within a cooperative alliance.

> "All models identify conditions under which enforcement will evolve and increase cooperation. As is typical for evolutionary models, benefits and costs matter. In particular, high costs to enforcement can make it less likely to evolve, or less effective when it does evolve. Nevertheless, enforcement is predicted in every system, and importantly, this occurs over a wide range of parameters, which is consistent with the general importance of enforcement independently of both biological details and scale." - [Enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41559-019-0907-1)

> "There is now a large body of evidence that enforcement shapes cooperation across all levels of biology. This includes systems that have undergone a major transition, like some social insects, as well as those that have not, like many mutualisms... While high costs can be prohibitive, a given cooperative system may explore diverse enforcement strategies over evolutionary time until a low-cost solution arises. Low costs to enforcement are further facilitated by power asymmetries. Enforcement can be enabled by a single powerful individual, such as a host who exercises control over symbionts, or by majority rule, such as within an animal society. There is also a role for pre-adaptations: pre-existing features of the biology of a system can enable enforcement and promote its effectiveness. Systems in which enforcement is not possible will be less likely to see increases in cooperation over evolutionary time, or they may even see cooperation fall away. It is in those systems where enforcement does arise that we see the full extent, and wonders, of cooperative evolution." - [Enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41559-019-0907-1)

> "Maintaining punishment (and thereby policing) as a public good by natural selection requires that individuals producing the good obtain sufficient fitness benefits that compensate for the associated costs.

> "We thus define ‘punishment’ as ‘a behavior that inflicts a net cost on, or removes net benefits from, a target individual in response to a specific behavior by that target individual’. Under an inclusive fitness approach, we can make two assumptions about the evolution of punishment. First, the imposed costs or removed benefits should on average be high enough to make the target behavior unprofitable, and second, ... punishment should only evolve when it provides a punisher with net inclusive fitness benefits." - [Policing and punishment across the domains of social evolution](https://sci-hub.se/10.1111/oik.02064)

But given that incentive-based thinking lies at the heart of economics and much of social science (not to mention evolutionary biology), it seems like a pretty damn good metatheory and I don't know of a better one. I cannot even conceive a better one, to be honest." - [Incentives Are Everything, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/incentives-are-everything?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=51257762)

> "Scientific theories never dictate human values, but they can often cast new light on ethical issues. From a sexual selection viewpoint, moral philosophy and political theory have mostly been attempts to shift male human sexual competitiveness from physical violence to the peaceful accumulation of wealth and status. The rights to life, liberty, and property are cultural inventions that function, in part, to keep males from killing and stealing from one another while they compete to attract sexual partners." - [Geoffrey Miller](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/927979)

Random drift can lead to the takeover of the neutral mutant. Or, in other words, if birds go to an island where there are no predators, they lose their ability to fly. A biological trait, to be evolutionary stable, must be under selection. The retaliation, sometimes retaliation against defection goes out if nobody's trying to defect. So you've got to always cooperate by random drift. But if we'd always cooperate, now we can guess what happens next: we invite Always defect. You have oscillations here, you have a mathematical model of human history, of economic cycles, of ups and downs.

We have also played experimental games where people can purchase reputation, they can trade reputation if they have good reputation, so we can actually determine the price of a good reputation in experimental situations. This indirect reciprocity relies on gossip; some people might have an interaction and others observe it, and others talk about it. We are obsessed with gossip. We are obsessed with talking about others and how it would be to interact with them...

Neighbors form clusters, or you and your friends have many interactions and you cooperate, and you can even be an unconditional cooperator with your friends, and that can work out. This is an evolutionary graph theory where you have a social network and people interact with others on the graph. More recently, we also developed more a powerful mathematical approach that we call evolutionary set theory, where you belong to certain sets, for example, the Mathematics Department, the Biology Department, Harvard, or MIT, or the gym, or the tennis club, and I interact with people in that set. I cooperate with the people in the set and I try to join sets of successful individuals. So the extension to classical evolutionary game theory here is in classic evolutionary game theory, people imitate successful strategies. Here they imitate successful strategies in successful locations. They want to move into successful locations, and that can give rise to this clustering that allows evolution of cooperation." - [The Evolution of Cooperation Edge Master Class 2011 by Martin Nowak](https://www.edge.org/conversation/martin_nowak-the-evolution-of-cooperation-edge-master-class-2011#:~:text=Spatial%20selection%20is,evolution%20of%20cooperation.)

> Generous in the following sense: if I have a new interaction, now I realize (and this is I think where most people go wrong) that this is not a game where it's either the other person or me who is winning. Most of our interactions are not like a tennis game in the US Open where one person loses and one person goes to the next round.

> "In other words, cooperation in groups on a genetic basis tends to be self-destructive. This may be clarified by introducing the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy. The strategy of the altruists, helping others even if they do not reciprocate the help, may lead to an increased fitness for the group but it is not stable, since it can be easily invaded by egoistic strategies that take advantage of the altruists' sacrifice, but without giving anything in return. Though the selfish strategies will globally lead to a decrease of fitness for the group, they are locally stronger than the altruist strategies. This is another expression of the principle of suboptimization: genetic evolution works at the level of the subsystem (the individual or the individual together with his kin), and what is optimal at that level will be selected, even though it is far from optimal at the level of the group. Campbell has summed up this predicament by the phrase "genetic competition among the cooperators": on the level of the genes rivalry continues, and that will eventually erode any cooperation on the level of the group." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Selection for reciprocal altruism
>
> The characteristics of "tit for tat" (and of the other more successful strategies) can be summarized by three concepts: 1) the strategy is "nice": this means that it will never be the first to defect; 2) the strategy is "provocable": if the opponent defects, it retaliates by defecting too; 3) the strategy is "forgiving": as soon as the opponent cooperates again, the strategy forgets about the previous defection, and cooperates.
>
> Niceness is advantageous because it opens the way to mutually beneficial cooperation. Retaliation is necessary in order to avoid being invaded by selfish profiteers. Forgivingness has the advantage of avoiding mutual rounds of retaliation. Indeed, suppose that an individual because of distrust, by way of test or just because of a misunderstanding would defect just once, then a non- forgiving strategy would continue to defect in reaction, and mutual cooperation could never emerge or be restored.
>
> In a second study Axelrod generalized his game theoretic simulation to an evolutionary setting. In this setting, fitness was explicitly introduced by giving a strategy an amount of offspring proportional to the number of points it got in the previous tournament. The tournament was then repeated by playing all members of the new population of strategies (in which more successful strategies were now more numerous) against each other. Again the points of this tournament were used to produce a second generation of offspring. This generation played a following tournament, and so on. After many generations the less successful strategies would have been eliminated by natural selection, while the most successful ones would become more and more numerous. This setting is not equivalent to the previous one, since the fitness of the strategies depends on the opponents against which they play, and the field of opponents changes in the course of the simulated evolution. Hence a strategy that is successful in the original field of opponents may no longer be fit after the field has drastically changed. Yet Axelrod found out that it was still "tit for tat" that was most successful.
>
> However, "tit for tat" does not turn out to be an evolutionary stable strategy in the strict sense. Indeed, once the field is dominated by "tit for tat", other strategies that are less retaliatory (or more forgiving) become as fit as "tit for tat" since there are no longer cheaters to take advantage from their unconditional altruism. However, once a sufficient percentage of strategies becomes too altruistic, selfish strategies can again gain in fitness by exploiting their altruism. The end result seems to be some kind of equilibrium mixture of strategies in which reciprocal altruists such as "tit for tat" dominate, but in which there may also appear small amounts of "nasty" (the opposite of "nice") strategies together with non-retaliating altruists.
>
> In how far can these simulation results be generalized to real evolution? The most important restriction in the experiment seems to be that opponents interact with each other for a long, consecutive sequence of exchanges. This may be true for two individuals engaged in a close and stable relation. Reciprocal altruism may thus explain how a symbiotic relationship between two organisms can develop (e.g. a hermit crab and the sea anemone living on its shell) (cf. Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). In the kind of situations involving a large number of individuals that interest us, on the other hand, it seems more likely that opponents will encounter each other only once, or now and then with long interruptions and exchanges with different opponents in between.
>
> "Tit for tat" is only successful in an indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. If there is only one transaction, no retaliation is possible afterwards, and rationality dictates that you should defect. If there is a finite number of transactions, it pays to defect during the last one, but if you expect your opponent to defect at the last one, you should also defect at the last-but-one, and hence your opponent would be wise to already defect at the last-but-two, and so on. Hence games with a fixed number (known by the participants) of transactions would lead to continuous defection. In practice, that does not seem to be the problem, since normally opponents do not know how often they will meet each other again.
>
> However, the basic practical limitation is that of memory: the reciprocal altruist should not only remember how his opponent treated him during the last transaction (which may be a long time ago) he should also be able to recognize and distinguish all opponents with whom he has ever had transactions. This requirement does not seem to be realistic in large groups, such as human societies. Moreover, in such large systems, many encounters will take place for the first (and perhaps the last) time. In such cases reciprocal altruism does no good, and the "nice" individual who starts by cooperating may be cheated most of the time by others he will never see again. When I buy something in a shop in a city where I will never come back again, I do not expect to be cheated (though that is possible of course), even though I have no power to retaliate. In conclusion, reciprocal altruism seems still insufficient to explain the ultrasociality of human society." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The basic weakness of reciprocal altruism in explaining ultrasociality is that it starts from dyadic relationships, of the type "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine". It is difficult to imagine how such one-to-one exchanges could be enlarged in order to form the basis for large collective organizations. Therefore we would like to see some evolutionary stable strategy that directs behaviour towards groups rather than towards other individuals.
>
> It has been proposed that one such strategy is moralism, that is to say behavior that rewards or reinforces altruistic behavior by others, and punishes or inhibits cheating or defection. For example, Trivers (1971) has postulated selection for "moralistic aggression", and Lorenz (1975) speaks about "innate ethical sense". The advantage of moralism compared to pure altruism is that the costs of moralizing towards others are clearly less than those of being altruistic yourself (Campbell, 1983). However, if everybody around you is continuously moralizing, and ready to ostracize or even kill you if you do not behave altruistically, it becomes quite difficult to behave in a selfish way. Hence groups consisting of moralizing individuals will also tend to be altruistic, though the individuals are not motivated to be altruistic on their own. Moralism is also more stable than real altruism because cheaters will find it very difficult to invade a population that tends to make their life as difficult as possible. A disadvantage of moralism is that it encourages hypocrisy, that is to say behavior that does everything to look altruistic but is in fact selfish.
>
> A basic weakness of the argument is that it is difficult to imagine how something as complicated as an "ethical sense" might develop through genetic evolution. It seems quite difficult to put down rules distinguishing moral or altruistic behavior from selfish behavior that are applicable to all situations and all individuals. We might perhaps imagine the evolution of simple behavior patterns such as aggressive reactions against the selfish wolf who does not want the others of the pack to share in the food, but that does not seem sufficient to explain ultrasociality.
>
> Another weakness of the moralistic selection argument, is that moralism mainly functions to maintain an already functioning cooperation system, by reducing the fitness of those who do not obey the rules. However, the argument does not explain how the cooperative pattern, and the moralistic attitude that maintains it, may have developed from selfish behavior in the first place." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The theory of natural selection on the basis of fitness is in principle applicable to all replicating systems, not only to genes. Recently, a new type of replicator has been proposed as a unit of cultural evolution. Memes are defined as cognitive or behavioral patterns that can be transmitted from one individual to another one by learning and imitation (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz, 1991). Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society, almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language, fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts, conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any replication at the level of the genes. Storing a concept or a habit in memory after having encountered it through another individual, does not require any change of the DNA." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Though that process will be subjected to the same basic principles of blind variation and natural selection on the basis of fitness, memetic evolution is basically a much more flexible mechanism. Genes can only be transmitted from parents (or parent in the case of asexual reproduction) to offspring. Memes can in principle be transmitted between any two individuals (though it will become more difficult the larger the differences in cognitive mechanisms and language are).
>
> For genes to be transmitted, you typically need one generation, which for higher organism means several years. Memes can be transmitted in the space of hours. Meme spreading is also much faster than gene spreading, because gene replication is restricted by the rather small number of offspring a single parent can have, whereas the amount of individuals that can take over a meme from a single individual is almost unlimited. Moreover, it seems much easier for memes to undergo variation, since the information in the nervous system is more plastic than that in the DNA, and since individuals can come into contact with much more different sources of novel memes. On the other hand, selection processes can be more efficient because of "vicarious" selection: the meme carrier himself does not need to be killed in order to eliminate an inadequate meme; it can suffice that he witnesses or hears about the troubles of another individual due to that same meme.
>
> The conclusion is that memetic evolution will be several orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than genetic evolution. It should not surprise us then that during the last ten thousand years, humans have almost not changed on the genetic level, whereas their culture (i.e. the total set of memes) has undergone the most radical developments. In practice the superior "evolvability" of memes would also mean that in cases where genetic and memetic replicators are in competition, we would expect the memes to win in the long term, even though the genes would start with the advantage of a well- established, stable structure." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Meme fitness will depend basically on three factors: 1) survivability of the carrier; 2) individual learnability of memes; 3) tendency of memes to spread or to be transmitted. The first criterion is similar to the one determining gene selection, so we won't go into much detail about it. Basically it states that, all other things being equal, memes leading to decreased probability of a carrier's survival, e.g. because they are bad for the health, or lead to dangerous or suicidal behavior, will tend to be eliminated. However, we must add that survival is to be interpreted on the level of the group of all carriers, rather than on the level of the individual." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is this contagiousness that most strikingly differentiates meme selection from gene selection. Genes, indeed, are not contagious. You can never get a gene, that you did not already have, from someone else. At most you can produce a child that shares some of your genes with some genes of another person." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "All memes have the implicit goal of making their carriers more fit, since an increased number of carriers signifies that there will be more memory space available for meme replication. If, as we have argued previously, cooperation among the carriers tends to increase the overall fitness of the group of carriers, it will be in the interest of memes to promote that cooperation. Moreover, since cooperation requires communication, and since meme spreading critically depends on communication, the "motivation" of memes to bolster cooperation should be even stronger than that of genes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The selective advantage does not mean that the less fit group will be physically eliminated during the competition with the cooperative group. On the level of memes, elimination can happen when the selfish group gives up its belief in the meme for selfishness and adopts the meme for altruism from the other group. This conversion of one group by another one may happen by direct physical force, for example because the altruist group is better organized to win a war between the groups, and can thus subdue the other one. It can also happen in a peaceful way because the less successful group simply imitates the more successful one.
>
> The basic argument against group selection is that group strategies can be easily invaded. However, that is not the case for memetic strategies. Indeed, suppose that a "mutant" meme promoting selfishness would appear in an altruist group. According to genetic reasoning, its carrier would be more fit than an altruist one, since he can profit from the altruism of the other carriers without paying the corresponding costs. However, the fitness of a meme is different from the fitness of its carrier. Though the selfish carrier might have enhanced fitness in the sense that he gets more food or other resources, the fitness of the meme he carries depends on how easily other members of the group can be converted to it.
>
> Now memes are selfish, which means that they have the implicit goal of thwarting all rival memes that compete for the same memory space. Hence the majority meme in the group will tend to consolidate the memory space it already occupies in the majority of carriers. A likely mechanism for that might be that the different carriers continuously reinforce each other's belief by communication and imitation. The carrier of the mutant meme, on the other hand, is alone and does not get any reinforcement from his fellows. He will find it very difficult to convert any of them to his non-conformist ideas, since the influence on any individual of a majority of conformists will be much stronger than that of a single dissident. This tendency of the majority meme to impose itself on minorities leads to intra-group homogeneity, as confirmed by Boyd and Richerson's (1985) mathematical model of cultural evolution" - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Memes will even succeed in transcending the problem of the genetic competition between the cooperators... Our criticism of the argument on the basis of moralism, namely that a complete ethical system seems too complex to evolve by genetic selection, does not apply to memetic evolution, which is much faster, and which adapts more readily to abstract models of the world." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "When two individuals, after sufficient interactions, have reached a stable cooperative relationship or pact, based on reciprocity, that agreement or convention can be viewed as a meme with two carriers. If there is communication, that same meme can be transferred to a third and a fourth carrier, and so on, who would thus come to join the convention. Indeed, an individual who observes an existing reciprocal relationship between two other individuals, and who notices the advantages following from their mutual cooperation, would be tempted to imitate their behavior. If a certain behavioral pattern tends to be imitated, that makes it a meme by definition. If that meme, in addition to it being contagious, also furthers the genetic fitness of its carriers, we may conclude that it has a high memetic fitness, and thus will tend to replace rival memes with a lower fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The limitations on memory that make reciprocity difficult for large groups, can also be evaded by memetic mechanisms. Indeed, a meme can easily evolve mechanisms for making members of the same cultural group easy to recognize. Individuals belonging to the same culture or ethnical group will usually distinguish themselves by clearly perceivable attributes or behavior... If such signs allow you to identify a member of your group, you can expect that he will also follow the group's agreement on reciprocity, and hence you can trust that he will cooperate, without you having to renegotiate a pact. If he does not, you can still alarm the other members of your group, and he will be subjected to moralistic aggression. In that sense it is to the advantage of both the group and separate individuals to wear the appropriate attributes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Many ethical systems explicitly refer to the ideal of "fraternity", and sometimes members of the same cultural group (e.g. monks or Freemasons) are supposed to call each other "brother". Though these are not brothers in the biological sense, the meme attempts to harness the innate tendency to behave altruistically towards kin and to use it for purposes different from the increase of genetic inclusive fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is possible to discern a clear progression from pure selfishness, to kin-restricted limited altruism, to "tit for tat" based dyads, to multi-individual reciprocal agreements, to moralism and group ideologies, and finally to the complex ultrasocial systems of cooperation characterizing present society." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "With the capacity for language appears the capacity to rapidly spread complex memes, and that gives memes a definite advantage over genes in directing further evolution. In recent times, the memes that seem to be dominating are those that tend to make the ideal of altruism or brotherliness universal, ignoring the distinctions created by older memes such as languages or religions. We will not go into detail about why that is happening but note that the evolutionary tendency towards more and more far-reaching or inclusive cooperation seems to continue, albeit with many ups and downs. Such an evolution towards stronger integration of subsystems, allowing optimization at the global level, is exemplified by Turchin's concept of a metasystem transition. Such an evolutionary transition is characterized by the appearance of a control system at the metalevel, steering and optimizing the actions of the subsystems at the level below." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "A basic conclusion of our general analysis is that you need communication before you can have cooperation, that is to say information must be shared. In organisms cooperating because of kin selection, the medium of communication is sexual reproduction: genetic "messages" are transmitted through special cells (sperm or egg cells) that cannot survive or develop independently of the process of sexual reproduction. It is this shared information that creates the connection between parents and offspring or, indirectly, between relatives. In primitive multicellular organisms, such as algae, the "communication" might be based on simple spatial contiguity (sharing of the same location). In complex organisms where there is differentiation of functions among cells, you need special chemical signals to coordinate the different cells (this can be modelled by "genetic networks", Kauffmann, 1991). In sociocultural systems, the basic medium supporting cooperation is meme spreading." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The complete evolutionary sequence would be something of the following form: competition, communication, stable interaction patterns, internal models of pattern, shared models, shared replicators, cooperation promoted by shared replicators, integration with the shared replicators as coordinators. In Turchin's terminology, the shared information will become a control for the systems of the level below, coordinating, monitoring and directing their cooperation. Hence the process of development of cooperation between initially competing subsystems through the development of shared replicators can be seen as a true metasystem transition." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is clear that the whole issue of how competing subsystems can start to cooperate and thus become (partly or completely) integrated into a globally optimizing supersystem is very complex. Many questions about cooperation, shared information, and higher levels of control still have to be answered. Yet I think it is equally obvious that these problems are of the utmost importance if we wish to understand our own further evolution, as individuals, as a species, as a culture, or as parts of the global world system." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)
