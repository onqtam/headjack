> "Altruism is not an improbable achievement against the individualizing forces of natural selection; rather, it is an integral part of the social lives of all beings that live with others interdependently—up to a (mathematical) point." - [Michael Tomasello](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10710208-altruism-is-not-an-improbable-achievement-against-the-individualizing-forces)

> "Nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish cooperation of many individuals." - [Albert Einstein](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1170750-nothing-truly-valuable-can-be-achieved-except-by-the-unselfish)

> "The competition between the two forces can be succinctly expressed as follows: Within groups selfish individuals beat altruistic individuals, but groups of altruists beat groups of selfish individuals. Or, risking oversimplification, individual selection promoted sin, while group selection promoted virtue." - [Edward O. Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3233345-the-competition-between-the-two-forces-can-be-succinctly-expressed)

^^ but altruism & group selection are not stable - we need consequence capture & managers
cooperation does not evolve easily


> "It’s bullshit. Indiscriminate altruism, untainted by vanity, reciprocity, or partiality, cannot evolve. It just can’t. I’m sorry. Any altruism that wasn't laser-focused toward our families or our allies, or that wasn’t otherwise shrewdly calculated to increase our status, would be mercilessly selected against by evolution. Darwinian accounting is scrupulous: debts must be repaid, costs must be cut, investments must be recouped." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20bullshit.%20Indiscriminate,must%20be%20recouped.)

> "The impartial, unreciprocated, non-status-boosting sacrifice for the greater good—cannot evolve. People really do not like this. They try to wriggle out of it in all sorts of frantic ways." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=the%20impartial%2C%20unreciprocated,of%20frantic%20ways.)

> "You don’t need a desire for moral progress to get moral progress, any more than you need a desire for traffic to get traffic. Here are some of the best, cynically Darwinian explanations I’ve seen for moral progress:
>
> 1. It’s a side-effect of capitalism.
>
> a) If you only sell stuff to members of your tribe, you’re not going to make as much money as someone who sells stuff to everyone. The same thing goes for consumers. If you only buy from your tribe, you’re going to get crappier stuff. Ditto for workers. If you only work for your tribe, you’ll get fewer job offers. And if you reward workers based on tribal loyalty, instead of productivity, you’ll get lower productivity, and less profit. That’s how all these WEIRD ideas about “meritocracy” and “treating people equally” emerged. They were self-interested strategies for buyers, sellers, workers, and employers. But once the capitalist pro-tip of “treating people equally” spread (and got written into the constitution), people started to look like hypocrites for not, you know, treating people equally. Low-status groups used the hypocrisy to rally people to their side in political conflicts.
>
> b) In a market economy, status accrues to those who are most successful in providing desirable goods and services at affordable prices. So when low-status groups enter the labor market in greater numbers, they rise in status. For example, at the turn of the 20th century, women entered the labor market in greater numbers. Why? Because with the rise of automation, there was a decline in manual labor that advantaged humans with greater upper body strength and no uteruses (i.e., men), and a rise in other kinds of service-based labor that women were good at. Women’s status, accordingly, rose. They began to leverage their rising status to advance their self-interest, as humans are wont to do. No, they weren’t seeking moral progress for everyone: the suffragists excluded African Americans from protests and didn’t like the idea of black men voting.
>
> 2. It’s a side-effect of communication technologies (itself a side-effect of capitalism):
>
> a) We didn’t evolve to estimate a group’s formidability based on census statistics; we evolved to estimate it based on how big and well-coordinated they look. To our stone-age brains, a marching minority looks bigger and stronger than it really is, as a percentage of the population. Transportation moves far-flung minorities into the same space to flex their muscles, and television transmits the image to everyone in the nation. When marginalized groups create the illusion of collective formidability, we no longer want to mess with them.
>
> b) When tribes start to become equally powerful, or start to appear equally powerful due to mass media, it creates an intergroup stalemate, a kind of mutually assured destruction. Hot wars turn into cold wars. Cold wars turn into culture wars.
>
> 3. It’s a side-effect of democracy (itself a side-effect of capitalism)
>
> a) When marginalized groups flex their muscles and win the right to vote, savvy politicians compete to attract their votes, and the coalition that recruits them gains political power. The partisans who find themselves in a political coalition with the marginalized groups start to look upon them with fondness. We like our allies—they’re on our team. So you get performative allyship and a decline of overt racism among whichever political coalition joins up with ethnic minorities. If that happens among cultural elites, who shape social norms, then you might get some new social norms about “political correctness” or “wokeness” or whatever you want to call it. And you might get a backlash to these norms among the elites’ political rivals (i.e., the working class “populists”).
>
> This is all very interesting, but don’t miss the point: moral progress was an accident. In fact, it must have been it accident, because our motives were designed by natural selection, and a motive for “moral progress” makes no evolutionary sense. Which means we shouldn’t feel too proud of ourselves. We’re the same old primates we always were—selfish, nepotistic, and groupish. We have the same capacity for evil, and the same capacity to rationalize it, as our forebears." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://www.everythingisbullshit.blog/p/darwin-the-cynic#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20need,as%20our%20forebears.)

> "I'm saying it's more insightful, useful, and predictively powerful to focus on the deeper goal, because that is the lever we must pull if we want to shape the behavior, and that is the key to understanding and predicting when and where the behavior will be performed. We must choose insight over idealism." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/darwin-the-cynic?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=42426004)

> "I don’t think it really matters whether the motive is conscious or not. Worldviews help us predict and explain people’s behavior. That’s their job. If I’m trying to predict and explain behavior, cynicism is going to help me do that, regardless of whether the cynical motives are conscious or not. It doesn’t matter why people *think* they’re donating to charity. What matters is why they are *actually* donating to charity—the specific causal factors that are influencing their decision. Those factors are inevitably going to be reputational, status-driven, nepotistic, reciprocal, and/ or groupish in nature. If I’m trying to design institutions with incentives that promote charitable giving, I need to look at people’s *actual* motives, not the motives they say they have... Motives are the things that causally influence and explain our behavior across a range of situations, regardless of whether we’re aware of them or not. Motives (and psychological systems) are the things that natural selection selects—not behaviors. When you understand the process that created our motives, there is simply no other option than to say those motives are selfish, nepotistic, or groupish. If you can think of another way for a motive to evolve that doesn’t involve replicating the genes that built it, I’d love to hear it. But until then, I’m going with Darwinian cynicism as the best way to explain and predict people’s behavior." - [Darwin the Cynic, by David Pinsof](https://open.substack.com/pub/everythingisbullshit/p/darwin-the-cynic?r=7omg8&utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=45901765)

The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is a general notion that can be extended to diverse systems and notions of efficiency.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy

In game theory, the price of stability (PoS) of a game is the ratio between the best objective function value of one of its equilibria and that of an optimal outcome.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_stability

The concepts of price of anarchy and price of stability were introduced to capture the loss in performance of a system due to the selfish behavior of its participants. The price of anarchy captures the worst-case performance of the system at equilibrium relative to the optimal performance possible. The price of stability, on the other hand, captures the relative performance of the best equilibrium of the system.

> "Take the case of academic publishing, given as a classic coordination failure by Eliezer Yudkowsky in Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck. Academic journals publish research within a given field and charge for access to it, often at exorbitant rates. In order to get the best jobs and earn prestige within a field, researchers need to publish in the most respected journals. If they don’t, no one will take their work seriously.
>
> Academic publishing is broken in many ways. By charging high prices, journals limit the flow of knowledge and slow scientific progress. They do little to help researchers, instead profiting from the work of volunteers and taxpayer funding. Yet researchers continue to submit their work to them. Why? Because this is the Nash equilibrium. Although it would be better for science as a whole if everyone stopped publishing in journals that charge for access, it isn’t in the interests of any individual scientist to do so. If they did, their career would suffer and most likely end. The only solution would be a coordinated effort for everyone to move away from journals. But seeing as this is so difficult to organize, the farce of academic publishing continues, harming everyone except the journals." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=Take%20the%20case,except%20the%20journals.)

> "It’s possible to change things on a large scale if we are able to communicate on a much greater scale. When everyone knows that everyone knows, changing what we do is much easier.
>
> We all act out of self-interest, so expecting individuals to risk the costs of going against convention is usually unreasonable. Yet it only takes a small proportion of people to change their opinions to reach a tipping point where there is strong incentive for everyone to change their behavior, and this is magnified even more if those people have a high degree of influence. The more power those who enact change have, the faster everyone else can do the same.
>
> To overcome coordination failures, we need to be able to communicate despite our differences. And we need to be able to trust that when we act, others will act too. The initial kick can be enough people making their actions visible. Groups can have exponentially greater impacts than individuals. We thus need to think beyond the impact of our own actions and consider what will happen when we act as part of a group." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20possible%20to,of%20a%20group.)

Thomas Aquinas
The rational polities - practical virtues - 4
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues
Temperance - internal regulation - self control
Fairness/justice
Goal rationality, prudence
Exploitation vs exploration - corush?
3 more: (the divine virtues) - required for a multi agent system to merge into a next level agent
Faith - willing to submit and project this next level agent
Love - discovery of a shared purpose
Hope - Willingness to invest in it before it is there
Logically derived for forming a coherent next level system

Alexander Bard is right that from a certain perspective the separation of church and state has been a mistake (just one perspective !!!)

- integrity
- sharing
ends in themselves that end up promoting other good stuff we want

> "I used to make fun of my friends for their obsessions with clothing brands, lifestyle aspirations, music subcultures, and social performances. It didn’t work. People think of social failure just in terms of drugs, mental illness, and suicide. But in practice, there are years of desperate attempts to fit in somewhere before that. People go all-in on these weird subcultures with plausible but false values. They think that if they push deeper into the aesthetic, it will give them somewhere to belong. But it doesn’t work, so they go even harder. It’s the classic pattern in cults of all kinds, and it leads only to misery." - [Don’t Learn Value From Society, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/13/dont-learn-your-values-from-society/)

> "Your values are a bet on what is best in life. There are multiple answers that work, but this is not a subjective question. If your value instincts are good, the world rewards you with power and life. If you make the wrong bets on what to do with your life, you end up unsuccessful or dead. If someone else can influence your values for their own purposes, you can end up slaving your life away for something that has nothing to do with your own real interests. I think this is what happened to my friends, and what is happening to many of you.
>
> The self-destructive lifestyles that take our friends don’t just happen spontaneously; they are ideological subcultures sustained by the activities they teach. The parties bring in new people, the drugs are a sort of initiation, the clothes are a uniform that identifies you as bought in, and the music and media supply a steady stream of ideals and ingroup perspective. Even diets serve as ingroup markers and separate you from outsiders.
>
> The resulting alienation from friends and family removes you from countervailing influences. All of these contribute to the social reproduction of the subculture and whatever values it teaches. If a lifestyle of partying, drugs, and alienation finally turns deadly, that’s fine as long as the average participant has by that point initiated enough new blood to sustain that lifestyle. When I’ve tried to talk to people who are on these paths, their answers are bizarre. They think it’s all good for them, and anyone questioning it is an enemy. It’s like talking to someone in a cult.
>
> Likewise, behind the anxieties that drive America’s upper middle class are the employers, schools, lifestyle brands, and political causes that are only too happy to feed those fears. As soon as you get too much of your social perspective from the society you live in, you are in danger. Whatever institutions can get your ear will teach you whatever values most efficiently motivate you for their own purposes. They’ll gladly feed you suggestions that have nothing to do with your own real interests, as long as it’s useful to them to do so. It would be too real to pay you in actual power, actual freedom, and actual vitality, so instead you’ll be taught to accept payment in slavecoin.
>
> Slavecoin is anything that is apparently valuable from inside the spectacle, but in fact, offers no possible independence from it, and can’t be redeemed for hard vital power. Slavecoin is fake in its substance: think of all the prestige, credentials, career attainment, identity validation, pleasures, luxuries, and financialized wealth that no longer buys power. These things seem valuable and have extensive social narratives backing them up. But when viewed skeptically from outside the system, there is much less substance there than the trusted social consensus would lead you to think.
>
> When I look at the things my friends were into before they destroyed themselves, this is what I see: false value sold to them by institutions and subcultures that have no structural reason to care about their real interests. But this applies to far more people than just the few that didn’t make it. Almost everybody is trapped in some kind of propaganda complex, wasting their lives working for effectively nothing.
>
> ... everyone was caught up in false neuroses taught to them by systems of extraction...
>
> Your social perspective, which includes your values, is a complex living system. It contains not just bets on what is most important, but also all the practical life wisdom that supports and implements those values, and defensive responses to the various counterarguments life and critics will throw at you. This is too big for you to produce by yourself. It is too big to even maintain by yourself. Like any other product of industry, a sane social perspective requires an extensive and trustworthy supply chain of information, ideas, and values bringing together the work of many other people.
>
> ... Trustworthy social perspective formation is what is missing in our society, and it is this that explains our strange social problems. For a variety of historical reasons, our social fabric is substantially weaker than it should be.
>
> Without being able to triangulate to a trustworthy shared social perspective, you are stuck between getting taken for a ride by propagandists and collecting kooky conspiracy theories. No matter how hard you try to be rational, you simply lack the logistical backing necessary for precision. Your social ideas will be crude and misfocused...
>
> The obvious solution is to rebuild real social fabric, or otherwise systematically provision trustworthy social perspective. This is easier said than done, but not exactly new technology either. Many churches pull off partial solutions every day, and we all have our networks of trusted friends. Besides, a large amount of power is sitting on the table for whoever can do it properly.
>
> The real problem is that there are many powerful and wealthy institutions in our society invested in the lies that keep people working for false value. Slavecoin is big business. Any effort to rebuild trustworthy social perspective would very quickly threaten these lies and thus find powerful enemies in these groups...
>
> This makes both social fabric and trustworthy social perspective intensely political problems. It also gives some clues as to how the whole social apocalypse is locked in. If the fundamental crisis is one of low trustworthiness in social perspective formation, and if powerful groups and institutions are taking advantage of that crisis with their own cults of false value, then we have a vicious feedback loop. Those powers will reinforce the conditions that degrade trustworthiness.
>
> ...
>
> Well-grounded values, which is to say values that actually serve and accelerate life rather than deplete it, come from only one source: hard engagement with reality, where you can form an experience-building feedback loop of trial, error, and vitality. Call it evolution, science, revelation, or just clear seeing—that’s the only way real knowledge gets built about anything." - [Don’t Learn Value From Society, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/13/dont-learn-your-values-from-society/)

> "We now translate the thing that called Abraham forward as “the LORD” or “God almighty,” but thousands of years of built-up ontological baggage do not necessarily help us understand what the authors of Genesis were getting at. The original word is closely related to a verb meaning simply “to exist” or “to cause.” It later identified itself to Moses as “I am.” In a more familiar cosmology, we might understand it as the living will of existence as such, the fundamental power behind all nature and contingent life.
>
> ...
>
> Abraham rejected the cults and their false and unnatural values. Instead of valuing the socially constructed and overly entangled values of the societies around him, Abraham expected a reward in the values natural to living existence. The various revelations he heard amounted to “I will make you a great nation. I will make your offspring as numerous as the dust on the ground and the stars in the sky. I will give them a great land, taken from those who sin against me. I will make your name great. I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you. Through you, all the peoples of the earth will be blessed.”
>
> The values invoked are significant: multiplication of biological kin, sovereign control of living space, eternal fame, rewards to friends and punishments to enemies, a universal benevolent impact, and harmony with the plans and laws of God and nature. These are things that, unlike slavecoin, have a very hard material existence outside of any particular symbolic social system. They are not the product of moralism, propaganda, or symbol manipulation. They are the fruits and substance of true life and true independence. This is the ball that Abraham kept his eye on in all his dealings." - [Don’t Learn Value From Society, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/13/dont-learn-your-values-from-society/)

> "There is nothing that can be done for those who have already fallen. Our neighbors that are currently caught in the false value vortex can only be helped on the margin. But for ourselves and the next generation, we have options.
>
> Our most important low-hanging fruit is to recognize the problem: most of the values we learn from the institutions around us are fake and exploitative. They do not represent our real interests.
>
> The issue isn’t just individual, either. A society overrun with these kinds of false value cults eventually has a very hard time sustaining even its own interests in real terms either. This problem is a symptom and cause of overall decline. No society where even the elites are hopped up on a previous generation’s manipulative propaganda can survive...
>
> In contrast to these false values, what we can do is recognize and orient ourselves more rigorously to Abraham’s hard natural values. Are you winning at a biological level? Are you getting more territory at a more sovereign level of control? Are you living rigorously in contact with natural law? Are you working on something that will achieve eternal fame? Are your enemies being cursed and your friends blessed? Does your winning at these things serve any great and higher plan of blessing for all creation and all peoples?" - [Don’t Learn Value From Society, Palladium Magazine](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/07/13/dont-learn-your-values-from-society/)

# SECTION: Make "Ought" Great Again
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "In the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’. That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not just ignorance).
>
> Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in criticizing moral explanations.
>
> ...
>
> Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual, scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole, has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate.
>
> We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong values with false theories.
>
> Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next – and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want. Some philosophers confine the term ‘moral’ to problems about how one should treat other people. But such problems are continuous with problems of individuals choosing what sort of life to lead, which is why I adopt the more inclusive definition. Terminology aside, if you were suddenly the last human on Earth, you would be wondering what sort of life to want. Deciding ‘I should do whatever pleases me most’ would give you very little clue, because what pleases you depends on your moral judgement of what constitutes a good life, not vice versa.
>
> This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy. For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer, because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. Trying to do so is the project of the influential moral philosophy known as utili tarianism, which played much the same role as empiricism did in the philosophy of science: it acted as a liberating focus for the rebellion against traditional dogmas, while its own positive content contained little truth.
>
> So there is no avoiding what-to-do-next problems, and, since the distinction between right and wrong appears in our best explanations that address such problems, we must regard that distinction as real. In other words, there is an objective difference between right and wrong: those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours...
>
> Beauty, right and wrong, primality, infinite sets – they all exist objectively. But not physically. What does that mean? Certainly they can affect you – as examples like Hofstadter’s show – but apparently not in the same sense that physical objects do. You cannot trip over one of them in the street. However, there is less to that distinction than our empiricism-biased common sense assumes. First of all, being affected by a physical object means that something about the physical object has caused a change, via the laws of physics (or, equivalently, that the laws of physics have caused a change via that object). But causation and the laws of physics are not themselves physical objects. They are abstractions, and our knowledge of them comes – just as for all other abstractions – from the fact that our best explanations invoke them. Progress depends on explanation, and therefore trying to conceive of the world as merely a sequence of events with unexplained regularities would entail giving up on progress." - [The Beginning of Infinity, by David Deutsch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity)

Metasystem transition - the emergence, through evolution, of a higher level of organization or control.

> "Metasystem transition theory (MST) is a general systems-level approach to understand the control of a higher level of complex organization and also a potential future singularity towards controlling a global superorganism. According to MST, higher levels of control organization can emerge from the coordination of less ordered subsystems. This type of higher coordination is hypothesized to emerge from the selection for more advanced information processing and communications, which enables previously disparate entities to synergistically coordinate their activities. Consequently, such systemic transitions change the relationship between the parts they are composed of, and (if successful) lead towards new emergent and stable characteristics of the whole, through the exploration of (in our context) new (sociotechnological) connections, new (sociotechnological) distinctions, and consequently, new (sociotechnological) possibility spaces." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "We must fundamentally rethink the nature of human controls: without the courage to acknowledge that nation-states are inadequate structures, globalization is ‘just a sham’. Part of the problem is that the psychology of the modern mind has been so fundamentally shaped by the nation-state that it is difficult for most to imagine the structure of a different world. However, remaining symbolically faithful to the nation-state, when its function as a structural control is so clearly endangering socioeconomic and ecological progress is dangerous as many of our most pressing problems related to economics, ecology and social space do not have borders (i.e. they are global, with an earth-space boundary only)." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "The emergence of the internet has created the foundations for an increasingly global world. In this context we must consider ways to approach a new form of globalization that is shaped by the whole of humanity. This will require a metasystem transition toward a higher level of systems complexity by reinventing the established control hierarchy. This reinvention could allow for the establishment of controls that maximize distributed intelligence and direct democracy within a digital medium that functions from ‘local to global’. Of course, this will require massive control innovation and a cultural revolution committed to radical distribution of concentrated power. Here we can learn from the founders of enlightenment if we have the daring to actually realize their transcendent dreams. There is no reason why control needs to possess a specific physical location in a truly mature information age. Instead, power could be distributed among all interconnected citizens in a multipolar Global Village. Such an organization should allow us to safely navigate the next frontier metasystem of humanity’s evolutionary experiment." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)

> "In the monarchical form one or a small group of agents defines all problems relevant to the system as a whole, and explores opportunities unavailable to other agents in the system as a whole. In the democratic form a small group of agents still defines problems and explores opportunities but must undergo constant change and replacement, and also must be subjected to constant feedback processes from the populous as a whole. In the theoretical commons form the center loses its ‘agential dimension’ and instead emerges from the collective interaction of agential consciousness. In this sense the center gains its coherence only from the distributed problem definition and opportunity exploration of the network of agential consciousness in-itself." - [Global Brain Singularity, by Cadell Last](https://cadelllast.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/phd-thesis-articles-pdf.pdf)




> "The emergence of new levels of organization has occurred within the human system three times, and has resulted in three broadly defined levels of higher control, producing three broadly defined levels of group selection (e.g., band/tribe, chiefdom/kingdom, nation-state/international). These are “Human Metasystem Transitions” (HMST). Throughout these HMST several common system-level patterns have manifested that are fundamental to understanding the nature and evolution of the human system, as well as our potential future development. First, HMST have been built around the control of three mostly distinct primary energy sources (e.g., hunting, agriculture, industry). Second, the control of new energy sources has always been achieved and stabilized by utilizing the evolutionary emergence of a more powerful information-processing medium (e.g., language, writing, printing press)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "Metasystems separate two qualitatively different levels of organization. The new level of organization must emerge from the coordination of new controls utilizing a new information medium for the integration of previously disparate subsystems." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "The stabilization of a new HMST appears to compress spatial and temporal restrictions on human action, both within the control system and within society as a whole. The highest metasystem controls display an ever-broader extension of control over larger regions of space, and they can accomplish this spatial feat in shorter durations of time (i.e., physical space-time barriers to human action are consistently and progressively reduced). Consequently, there is a trend toward accelerated metasystem emergence, as the space-time reach of human action progressively increases. The hunting transition occurred over a period of hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years, the agricultural transition occurred over a period of thousands of years, and the industrial transition has been occurring over a period of centuries. This metasystem process has resulted in more complex human organizations directly and coherently controlling more of the Earth’s surface, faster. For individuals, the consequence is the emergence of systems that increasingly allow for action that is global (spatial) and instant (temporal). Therefore, in regards to both space and time, higher metasystem controls appear to facilitate a culturally and technologically mediated conquest of dimensionality." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "Nation-states currently represent the highest control systems, and thus, the highest human metasystems. However, it is unlikely that these organizational structures represent the pinnacle of human evolution, or cosmic evolution for that matter, as cultural and technological processes could allow for the production of higher complexity in the future: a fourth human metasystem." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "This next metasystem may not be too far from fundamentally disrupting modern control structures, as radically new energy and information systems are developing and could form higher collective synergies than current information-energy systems." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "But that is not to say that the Internet is fully mature, in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Quantitatively, most humans still do not have Internet access (although access is increasing quickly, and the selection pressures for truly global access are strong). Qualitatively, Internet experience itself is likely to change dramatically, as advances in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and semantic web technologies will likely alter the way humans interact with each other, and with computers. These quantitative and qualitative developments combined could result in an Internet at full maturity that acts as a self-organizing “planetary nervous system” or “global brain”, facilitating all intelligent agent interaction all the time." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

Will the next system be a transition to higher levels of state cooperation, similar to what is currently occurring in the European Union? Will the next system experience fragmentation to stronger local governance? Or will the next system develop a wholly new type of control structure utilizing emergent information technology related to artificial intelligence and collective intelligence? In other words: what will be the nature of subsystem integration and higher organization?" - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "The emergence of a fundamentally new information medium and energy structure could suggest the beginnings of a metasystem transition towards a higher level of control. If true the first half of the twenty-first century could be characterized by a fundamental disruption to the operations of the nation-state and the stabilization of new higher forms of human organization. What we can learn from previous human metasystem transitions is that new controls will likely be organized utilizing the highest emergent information medium (in this case, the Internet as medium should play a crucial organizing role)." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

> "The fourth human metasystem would allow us to enter a world as different from the industrial world as the industrial world is from the agricultural world, or as different from the agricultural world as the latter was from the hunting world. But to enter such a world would be to challenge and successfully replace, fundamentally, the current structure of our world. Such a transition would be unprecedented, although the idea of higher global integration has a long and complex history." - [Human Metasystem Transition (HMST) Theory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284157238_Human_metasystem_transition_HMST_theory)

These terms typically refer to events where organisms come together, through cooperative evolution, to form a larger organism—a superorganism that has a collective intelligence that is greater than the intelligence of any of its members.  
>
> One such transition occurred when single-celled organisms formed a multicellular organism. Another occurred when multicellular organisms came together to form societies. Ant colonies are a popular example, but human civilization is another, although we don’t typically think of the global population of humans as forming a superorganism. But what we are collectively is a global brain, in which humans and their devices and AIs form something like a neural network that spans the planet. The body of the superorganism that supports the global brain is the entire biosphere, and the processes of life make up its physiology." - [The Purposeful Universe: Why the Emergence and Continual Evolution of Life and Intelligence are Inevitable Products of Cosmic Complexification, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/the-purposeful-universe-why-the-emergence#:~:text=The%20other%20major,up%20its%20physiology.)

> "Turchin lays out his [metasystem transition theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasystem_transition). This theory describes the predictable emergence of higher levels of organization and control through transitions that he calls metasystem transitions, which involve independent systems coming together to form metasystems (systems made of systems). The emergence of life, multicellularity, and societies all represent major metasystem transitions, which were called major evolutionary transitions in the field of evolutionary biology. He argued that each of these transitions represents a qualitative shift in the complexity and organization of the system, with the higher-level system exhibiting properties and behaviors that cannot be reduced to the sum of its parts.
>
> Turchin’s theory and Teilhard de Chardin’s are basically one and the same, and make similar predictions for human civilization, but Turchin brings the science of cybernetics into the picture, which is the field of study that understands how systems use feedback processes to maintain a stable state of dynamic equilibrium, adapt, grow, and exercise control.
>
> According to Turchin’s theory, as societies evolve, they undergo periodic transitions that result in the creation of new, more complex systems that integrate and supersede the previous ones. These transitions are driven by the accumulation of knowledge, the development of new technologies, and the resolution of conflicts between competing interests. The agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the ongoing digital revolution can all be seen as examples of metasystem transitions.
>
> Based on his metasystem transition theory, Turchin made several predictions about the future evolution of human society and technology. He believed that humanity was on the cusp of a new metasystem transition, driven by the rapid advancement of information technology and artificial intelligence. He predicted that this transition would lead to the emergence of a global "superorganism" — a highly integrated and interconnected network of humans and machines that would exhibit collective intelligence and behavior. This idea is essentially indistinguishable from Teilhard de Chardin’s noosphere.
>
> Turchin also envisioned the development of advanced forms of artificial intelligence that would be capable of self-improvement and recursive self-modification. He argued that this could potentially lead to an "intelligence explosion," where AI systems would rapidly surpass human intelligence and transform the nature of civilization itself. This prediction has much in common with Kurzweil’s law of accelerating returns, and represents an early vision of the technological singularity.
>
> By applying these three laws in conjunction, we can begin to envision a future in which human civilization becomes increasingly interconnected, increasingly integrated with our technology, and increasingly organized on a global scale. The law of accelerating returns suggests that we will continue to develop powerful new technologies at an exponential rate, while the law of complexification indicates that these technologies will enable us to form more intricate and interdependent networks of communication and collaboration. At the same time, metasystem transition theory implies that we may be on the verge of a major societal transition that could result in the emergence of a global society characterized by unprecedented levels of cooperation, innovation, and sustainability.
>
> If this is true, and metasystem transitions work like [phase transitions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037843710600402X), then there is always a period of chaos and instability during the transition, because that chaos creates the flexibility in the system needed for it to transition to a new configuration. This could explain all the global chaos we are seeing right now, with two major wars and growing ideological polarization and division around the world. Ironically, leaps to greater cooperation involve greater chaos. Systems “scream for change” before a a major leap in progress, and knowledge of this fact should be built into the logic of our future forecasting." - [How to Predict the Future: The Law of Complexification is Science's Crystal Ball, by Bobby Azarian](https://roadtoomega.substack.com/p/how-to-predict-the-future-the-law#:~:text=Turchin%20lays%20out,our%20future%20forecasting.)



> "Humans are undergoing what biologists call a major transition. Such transitions occur when less complex forms of life combine in some way to give rise to more complex forms. Examples include the transition from independently replicating molecules to replicating packages called chromosomes or, the transition from different kinds of simple cells to more complex cells in which these once-distinct simple cell types came to perform critical functions and become entirely mutually interdependent, such as the nucleus and mitochondria in our own cells. Our species’ dependence on cumulative culture for survival, on living in cooperative groups, on alloparenting and a division of labor and information, and on our communicative repertoires mean that humans have begun to satisfy all the requirements for a major biological transition. Thus, we are literally the beginnings of a new kind of animal. By contrast, the wrong way to understand humans is to think that we are just a really smart, though somewhat less hairy, chimpanzee. This view is surprisingly common. Understanding how this major transition is occurring alters how we think about the origins of our species, about the reasons for our immense ecological success, and about the uniqueness of our place in nature. The insights generated alter our understandings of intelligence, faith, innovation, intergroup competition, cooperation, institutions, rituals, and the psychological differences between populations. Recognizing that we are a cultural species means that, even in the short run (when genes don’t have enough time to change), institutions, technologies, and languages are coevolving with psychological biases, cognitive abilities, emotional responses, and preferences. In the longer run, genes are evolving to adapt to these culturally constructed worlds, and this has been, and is now, the primary driver of human genetic evolution." - [Joseph Henrich](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10125274-the-case-i-ve-presented-in-this-book-suggests-that-humans)

# SECTION: Common knowledge
██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

> "Successful communication sometimes is not simply a matter of whether a given message is received. It also depends on whether people are aware that other people also receive it. In other words, it is not just about people's knowledge of the message; it is also about people knowing that other people know about it, the "metaknowledge" of the message... just one "level" of metaknowledge is not enough. Taking this further, one soon realizes that every level of metaknowledge is necessary... The term "common knowledge" is used in many ways but here we stick to a precise definition. We say that an event or fact is common knowledge among a group of people if everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows it, and so on. Two people can create these many levels of metaknowledge simply through eye contact: say that when our acquaintance yells I am looking at you and you are looking at me. Thus I know you know about the yell, you know that I know that you know (you see me looking at you), and so on. lf we do manage to make eye contact, we get off the bus; communication is successful." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "How do individuals coordinate their actions? Here we consider "coordination problems," in which each person wants to participate in a group action but only if others also participate. For example, each person might want to take part in an antigovernment protest but only if there are enough total protesters to make arrests and police repression unlikely. People most often "solve" coordination problems by communicating with each other. Simply receiving a message, however, is not enough to make an individual participate. Because each individual wants to participate only if others do, each person must also know that others received a message. For that matter, because each person knows that other people need to be confident that others will participate, each person must know that other people know that other people have received a message, and so forth. In other words, knowledge of the message is not enough; what is also required is knowledge of others' knowledge, knowledge of others' knowledge of others' knowledge, and so on-that is, "common knowledge." To understand how people solve coordination problems, we should thus look at social processes that generate common knowledge. The best examples turn out to be "public rituals," such as public ceremonies, rallies, and media events.
>
> Public rituals can thus be understood as social practices that generate common knowledge. For example, public ceremonies help maintain social integration and existing systems of authority; public rallies and demonstrations are also crucial in political and social change. Social integration and political change can both be understood as coordination problems; I am more likely to support an authority or social system, either existing or insurgent, the more others support it. Public rituals, rallies, and ceremonies generate the necessary common knowledge. A public ritual is not just about the transmission of meaning from a central source to each member of an audience; it is also about letting audience members know what other audience members know." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "To understand public rituals, one should understand how they generate the common knowledge that the logic of rationality requires. To understand how rational individuals solve coordination problems, one should understand public rituals." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Common knowledge depends not only on me knowing that you receive a message but also on the existence of a shared symbolic system which allows me to know how you understand it.
>
> Because common knowledge generation is important for coordinated action, it is something people fight over; for example, censorship typically cracks down hardest on public communications." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Common knowledge not only helps a group coordinate but also, to some extent, can create groups, collective identities, "imagined communities" in which, for example, each newspaper reader is aware of millions of fellow readers." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

collective action problems = free rider problems (prisoners' dilemma) + coordination problems
- solving free rider problems is about changing the motivations of actors through rules & incentives
- solving coordination problems is about forming common knowledge because the decisions of actors to participate aren't independent
solving a free rider problem could entail first solving a coordination problem about wanting to solve the free rider problem

> "Coordination Problems
>
> I should make clear that a coordination problem is not a "free rider problem," also known as the "prisoners' dilemma." In a free rider problem, no person wants to participate under any circumstances: each person always prefers to "free ride" on the participation of others. We all want to keep the common field green, for example, but everyone has an incentive to let his herd overgraze. "Solving" free rider problems hence requires enlarging people's possible motivations, by for example legal or social sanctions against free riders or repeated contexts in which free riding now might make people not cooperate with you later. "Solving" coordination problems, however, does not require changing peoples' motivations: when everyone cooperates, each person wants to do so because everyone else is. Although the term "collective action problem" is often used to refer only to free rider problems (Olson 1971), some argue that collective actions such as political protest are better described as coordination problems (e.g., Chong 1991; see also Moore 1995). Also, even when solving free rider problems via sanctions, for example, there is the "prior" coordination problem of getting people to participate in a system of sanctions, because usually a person wants to participate in sanctioning only if others do also.
>
> A coordination problem also does not require complete commonality of interest; all that is necessary is that each person's motivation to participate increases (or at least does not decrease) the more others participate. For example, in a political protest, there might be "militants" who want to take part even if only a few others do, "moderates" who want to participate only if many others participate and make it seem a reasonable thing to do, and "hangers-on" who simply want to be part of a big crowd experience and are indifferent about the protest's political aims. As long as for each person "the more the merrier," we have a coordination problem. What is ruled out in a coordination problem is each person not caring what others do, thus making each person's decision completely independent, or each person wanting to participate only if others do not - for example, wanting to go to the beach only when it is not crowded.
>
> In a coordination problem, each person wants to coordinate with others but there can be considerable disagreement about how to coordinate. For example, "many Ghanaians would prefer to rely on a common indigenous national language but differ as to which it should be" (Laitin 1994, p. 626). A given coordination might be very bad for a person, but she still might choose to participate because this undesirable coordination is better than the even worse possibility of non participation. For simplicity, we generally assume that the only issue is whether to participate; the issue of how people fight over how to coordinate is considered later." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

pluralistic ignorance - wrong beliefs about the beliefs of others and wrong perceptions of how widespread a belief is, possible due to the absence of common knowledge

> "Social psychologists developed the concept of "pluralistic ignorance," which refers to a situation in which people hold very incorrect beliefs about the beliefs of others, and is in this sense the absence of common knowledge. To take one of many examples, in a 1972 survey 15 percent of white Americans favored racial segregation, but 72 percent believed that a majority of the whites in their area favored segregation (O'Gorman 1979; see also Shamir 1993). Most see pluralistic ignorance as a distortion at the individual level (e.g., Mullen and Hu 1988; see O'Gorman 1986): a person reduces dissonance by thinking that her own view is the majority view, for example. Recently it has been applied to the Soviet Union and eastern European states, the idea being that dissatisfaction was widespread but that few people knew how widespread it was. These accounts focus on limited communication: criminal penalties for self-expression, a government-controlled press, and a lack of social ties. "The reduction of pluralistic ignorance," due to modern communication technology and increased foreign contacts, "led ... to a political wave of tremendous power" (Coser 1990, p. 182; see also Kuran 1991) and the collapse of these regimes." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

the role of common knowledge in submitting to authority, beliefs, systems, rules & institutions

> "... submitting to a social or political authority is a coordination problem: each person is more willing to support an authority the more others support it... This coordination problem can result not only from a desire to reach consensus but also from intimidation... Because submitting to an authority is a coordination problem, an authority creates ceremonies and rituals that form common knowledge.
>
> ... But changing weights, measures, and the calendar is particularly effective not simply because they change the way that a given individual thinks about the revolution or the physical world, but because they change how individuals interact with each other; they change what an individual knows about other individuals.
>
> ... But as Scott (1990, p. 49) notes, "the successful communication of power and authority is freighted with consequences insofar as it contributes to something like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If subordinates believe their superior to be powerful, the impression will help him impose himself and, in turn, contribute to his actual power." Hence the publicity of rituals, their "successful communication," can constitute power all by itself; association is helpful but not absolutely necessary.
>
> ... coordination problems include not only quite specific tasks such as group hunting but also overarching matters such as political and social authority. Earlier we considered authority simply in terms of each person's decision about whether to consent to a given regime, but authority generally includes much more, such as systems of social status, implicit and explicit rules of behavior, and the entire set of ideas and institutions that guide social interaction. A ritual should then make public, make common knowledge, in this case not a specific hunting plan, but a set of beliefs and rules." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

on structure, formalism & repetition in rituals to remove ambiguity and uncertainty

> "... each participant in a ritual can never be completely sure that the other participants are paying full attention. Formalization, the fact that once one phrase is said, the next automatically follows, assures each participant that even a person who momentarily loses attention or mentally drifts off for a while can still easily figure out what other people must have heard. With lots of repetition and structure, a person who is only paying attention at the end can still know what a person who only paid attention at the beginning heard. On a longer time scale, performing rituals the same way year after year gives a young person confidence that he hears what older people heard years ago, and an old person confidence that future people will know what he knows. The certainty of the ritual sequence generates authority not by enforcing responses but by helping generate common knowledge.
>
> ... a ritual employs several parallel ways of saying the same thing, and thus each person knows that even if another person might not "get it" in one way, she can in another. Audience participation - for example, call and response - helps create common knowledge: each person can see from the gestures or speech of others that they are in fact paying attention." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

Inward-Facing Circles

> "One specific way to generate common knowledge ... is eye contact. For larger groups the closest thing to eye contact is for everyone to face each other in a circle, which enables each person to see that everyone else is paying attention. Perhaps this is one reason why inward-facing circles help in coordination." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

<!-- > "I then look at examples of people facing each other in circles, as in the kiva, a ritual structure found in prehistoric structures in the southwestern United States, the seating configuration of various U.S. city halls, and revolutionary festivals during the French Revolution. In each of these examples, the circular form was seemingly intended to foster social unity. But how? Our explanation is based on common knowledge generation. An inward-facing circle allows maximum eye contact; each person knows that other people know because each person can visually verify that others are paying attention." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212) -->

examples: 1) common knowledge with cc vs bcc in email, 2) coming out as gay in 1 on 1 convos with everyone before making it public

> "For users of electronic mail, common knowledge is nicely described as the difference between cc: ("carbon copy") and bcc: ("blind carbon copy"). When one sends a message to several people at the same time via the To: address line or via carbon copy, each receiver gets the list of people to whom the message is sent. With blind carbon copy, however, each receiver gets a message such as "recipient list suppressed." In terms of the transmission of messages from one person to another, carbon copy and blind carbon copy are the same; they differ in whether they allow recipients knowledge of other recipients. Because carbon copy allows each recipient to have the email addresses of other recipients, it invites bulk email "spamming." But this disadvantage is sometimes outweighed by the need to generate common knowledge. For example, "Ms. Tadaki said having her e-mail list borrowed made her rethink how she addresses messages to a large list. 'Next time I send out a change of address, I will definitely do Bcc,' she said. Even so, Ms. Tadaki said there were still cases when she would use the To field for group messages-namely, an invitation to a party or some other social gathering. 'It allows people to see who else is coming or who is invited'" (Stellin 2000).

> ... Common knowledge is in some sense the opposite of a secret. George describes how he came out as a gay man: "I told Peter first ... then I told Fred ... and told them not to tell anyone else or talk about it with anyone else until I did .... After I talked with other people in our circles, then they did, so after a while everyone was talking with everyone else about it instead of having this big secret that everyone bottled up inside" (Signorile 1995, p. 76). Initially, George told other people individually; even though everyone knew that George was gay, for each person it was still a secret. Once Peter and Fred initiated conversation, people began to know that other people knew; the secret evaporated only after common knowledge was formed.

Much of the point of this book is that cultural practices must also be understood in terms of "publicity" or, more precisely, common knowledge generation." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

marketing and coordination problems around products

> "Buying certain kinds of goods can be a coordination problem; for example, a person might want to see a movie more the more popular it is. To get people to buy these "coordination problem" goods, an advertiser should try to generate common knowledge." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Buying a particular good might be a coordination problem for various reasons. Technological reasons include "network externalities" (Katz and Shapiro 1994): a person would be more likely to buy a Macintosh computer, fax machine, or DVD player if others buy it also, because a person's utility from buying it increases as the number of other people buying it increases. "When you go to Office Depot to buy a fax machine, you are not just buying a US$200 box. You are purchasing for $200 the entire network of all other fax machines" (Kelly 1997). Social reasons can be also quite strong: I might want to see the movie Titanic simply because I want to be able to talk about it with my friends and co-workers. I might be more likely to buy Miller Lite beer if it is popular, so that when friends come over, I can give them beer which I expect they will like. Coordination problems might exist for newly introduced goods, because of the fun or distinction in being part of a new popular trend, or simply because one doesn't feel as foolish when purchasing a new good if one knows that others are buying it too. "Pleasure from a good is greater when many people want to consume it, because a person does not want to be out of step with what is popular" (Becker 1991, p. 1110).
>
> ... Many have argued that advertising "creates needs" that people would not have cared about otherwise; for example, in the early 1900s "the visible application of cosmetics was deemed highly inappropriate by middle-class Americans" (Vinikas 1992, p. 57). But perhaps it is less a matter of creating individual isolated needs than of tapping into the deep and basic need of each individual to conform to community standards, an ever present coordination problem. Thus a mechanism for generating common knowledge, such as national magazine advertising, would have greatest advantage in matters over which existing common knowledge mechanisms, such as conversation among friends, are weakest: "delicate" and "taboo" issues such as personal hygiene and appearance. People fighting the external influence of modern advertising would thus try to reduce its advantage by generating common knowledge internally, "breaking the taboo" and speaking freely among themselves.
>
> ... In other words, people upgrade only if they think that others will too; upgrading is a coordination problem. According to Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, "you have to create a lot of excitement to overcome inertia" (Helm 1995). For coordination problem goods such as computer operating systems, you need more than just excitement: you need common knowledge.
>
> ... The Discover card is a nice example of a "network externality": consumers use them only if enough retailers accept them, and retailers accept them only if enough consumers use them. People might be more likely to buy a new model of car if they know that many other people will buy it: an unpopular car might be more difficult or expensive to service, for example. Purchasing goods like cars, clothing, shoes, beer, and soft drinks, which to some degree are consumed publicly, can be a coordination problem if people want to show that they are participating in what's popular.
>
> ... I call a good "social" if a person is more likely to buy it the more other people buy it; buying a social good is a coordination problem. If we assume that viewers generally know which shows are popular, we can say that when a product is advertised on a popular show, not only do many people see the ad, each viewer knows that many other people see the ad. Hence our argument would say that social goods should be advertised on popular shows." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

practical ways of thinking about common knowledge without falling into infinite recursion and impossible ideals

> "The most obvious problem with the concept of common knowledge is that it seems to require great cognitive abilities: can anyone think through, say, more than two or three layers of "I know that she knows that he knows ... "? Common knowledge thus seems to be an ideal, impractical concept. For example, Ariel Rubinstein (1989) gives an example in which two people have ninety-nine levels of metaknowledge but cannot coordinate because they do not have the hundredth. There are various ways of making the concept of common knowledge less strict and more plausible. Instead of requiring that I know that you know, one can require that I believe with 90 percent probability that you believe with 90 percent probability and so on (Monderer and Samet 1989; Morris, Rob, and Shin 1995; Morris 1999). One can also define common knowledge not as a condition on arbitrarily many levels, but on a recursive step, which is more plausible as an actual thought process (see Lewis 1969, p. 52; also, e.g., Milgrom 1981): assume that when we make eye contact, we both know that we are making eye contact. When we make eye contact, I know that we are making eye contact, and hence I know that you know that we are making eye contact, and so forth. Perhaps the most plausible way of dealing with this issue, as pointed out by Herbert Clark and Catherine Marshall (1992, p. 33), is to say that people recognize common knowledge and deviations from it heuristically: "if A and B make certain assumptions about each other's rationality, they can use certain states of affairs as a basis for inferring the infinity of conditions all at once." When we make eye contact, I don't have to think through anything; I can simply infer from past experience that usually when we make eye contact, common knowledge is formed... common knowledge is not just an ideal but a concept that is subject to emprical investigation, not only at the level of social practices but also at the levels of psychology, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "Common knowledge is often important for coordination. For example, a group of people might want to speak out about an issue, but only feel comfortable doing so if there’s enough of them speaking out at the same time that they have safety in numbers." [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html)

> "As Michael Suk-Young Chwe writes in Rational Ritual: Culture, Coordination, and Common Knowledge, “Successful communication sometimes is not simply a matter of whether a given message is received. It also depends on whether people are aware that other people also receive it.” According to Suk-Young Chwe, for people to coordinate on the basis of certain information it must be “common knowledge,” a phrase used here to mean “everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows it, everyone knows that everyone knows that everyone knows it, and so on.” The more public and visible the change is, the better." - [Coordination Problems: What It Takes to Change the World](https://fs.blog/coordination-problems/#:~:text=As%20Michael%20Suk,is%2C%20the%20better.)

partisanship as a coordination problem

> "... rates of partisan affiliation in the United States - measured by asking a person whether she considers herself to be a member of a political party, or whether she cares which party wins, for example - tend to be higher in states in which people can publicly register their party affiliation when they register to vote. This suggests that partisanship is a coordination problem; if partisanship were mainly about, for example, individual loyalty, then party registration laws should not make a difference." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

concluding remarks - game theory, rational choice theory

> "This book ... starts with a narrow, unadorned conception of rationality in the context of coordination problems and shows that the common knowledge required is substantially related to issues of intersubjectivity, collective consciousness, and group identity. It starts with isolated individuals facing real, practical problems of coordination and shows that transcending the "transmission" view of communication (first-order knowledge) and including the "ritual" view (common knowledge) is exactly what is required.
>
> ... The idea that rational choice theory, in particular game theory, might be helpful in looking at cultural practices might seem novel, but was in fact advocated more than thirty years ago by Erving GoHman (1969) in, among other books, Strategic Interaction, and Claude Levi-Strauss (1963, p. 298), who explicitly stated that game theory allowed the "increasing consolidation of social anthropology, economics, and linguistics into one great field, that of communication." The explicit application of game theory to symbolic action and culture, presaged by the work of Schelling, has recently been pursued in several directions... I argue that this development should not be considered a diversion or side application but rather a necessary step in game theory's own internal agenda. The argument is not that cultural practices are additional side topics that it would be nice for rational choice theory to look into. The argument is that the agenda of rational choice theory itself demands it.
>
> Game theory is often used simply because it can make some kind of prediction when other kinds of reasoning do not. The textbook example in economics, for instance, is that of oligopoly. When there is a monopoly (a single firm), a prediction can be made by assuming profit maximization; when there is a competitive market (numerous firms, each too small to influence the equilibrium price), a prediction can be made by assuming that supply equals demand. In oligopoly, in which several firms interdependently influence prices, game theory is called upon to find an equilibrium, to make a prediction.
>
> Sometimes, however, game theory is simply not good at prediction. Many game theoretic models have a large number of equilibria. For example, take the case of whether people drive on the right side of the road or on the left. Everyone driving on the right is an equilibrium in the sense that given that everyone else drives on the right, no one wants to "deviate" and drive on the left. Everyone driving on the left is also an equilibrium. Here there are two equilibria; we might be able to predict that everyone will drive on the same side, but we cannot predict whether that side will be the left or right. This is a very simple example, but, in general, the problem of indeterminacy can be severe, with many equilibria possible.
>
> There are several ways of responding to this problem, which is a fundamental one. One is to try to squeeze as much predictive power as possible from the game itself, assuming that the objective is to make a unique prediction in any game and developing axioms that allow one to do so (as exemplified by Harsanyi and Selten 1988). Another is to consider explicitly the social process, external to the game, by which people coordinate on an equilibrium. Broadly speaking, there are at least three kinds of models that do this.
>
> Much recent work in game theory models individuals in a game as learning, adapting, or being selected in an evolutionary process (e.g., Samuelson 1998, Young 1998). The idea is that some equilibria might be more likely than others to result from a dynamic process of adaptation. This approach, which typically assumes that people follow simple learning rules or adaptations, is also often intended to counter the common objection that game theory assumes hyperrationality. The second approach is focal points, as discussed earlier, which are often interpreted as an aspect of a society's culture; for example, New Yorkers are more likely to choose Grand Central Station as a place to meet while non-New Yorkers are more likely to choose the Empire State Building; the "focalness" of Grand Central Station can be understood as part of New York local culture.
>
> Both of these approaches are important, but assume that the coordination process is not purposeful. The adaptive or evolutionary approach is reminiscent of "invisible hand" explanations in that people do not purposefully coordinate; coordination "just happens" without anyone planning or even thinking about it. Focal points are usually understood as something given exogenously (e.g., Kreps 1990), despite Schelling's ([1960] 1980, p. 144; see also Calvert 1992) observation that "when there is no apparent focal point for agreement, [a person] can create one by his power to make a dramatic suggestion." The third approach, which we employ in this book, is to consider coordination as an active, purposeful process achieved through explicit communication (see Johnson 1993). Coordination is often achieved through adaptation and evolution, and implicit communication, but often people explicitly communicate...
>
> If we look at how people explicitly communicate in order to solve coordination problems, the issue of common knowledge immediately arises, from standard game theoretic reasoning as well as linguistic theories of meaning and strong commonsense intuitions. Looking at how common knowledge is formed in societies, one is necessarily drawn to communicative events that look like rituals: ceremonies, media events, and so forth. By associating common knowledge with cultural practices, this book suggests a close and reciprocal relationship between the perspectives of rationality and culture, which are often thought separate or even antagonistic. The idea of individual rationality, historically associated with atomistic market societies, can help in understanding cultural practices which seem to create social unity. The study of culture has long considered economic contexts; pursuing the logical consequences of "material" rationality, game theory finds culture." - [Rational Ritual, by Michael Suk-Young Chwe](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1116212)

> "All models identify conditions under which enforcement will evolve and increase cooperation. As is typical for evolutionary models, benefits and costs matter. In particular, high costs to enforcement can make it less likely to evolve, or less effective when it does evolve. Nevertheless, enforcement is predicted in every system, and importantly, this occurs over a wide range of parameters, which is consistent with the general importance of enforcement independently of both biological details and scale." - [Enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41559-019-0907-1)

> "There is now a large body of evidence that enforcement shapes cooperation across all levels of biology. This includes systems that have undergone a major transition, like some social insects, as well as those that have not, like many mutualisms... While high costs can be prohibitive, a given cooperative system may explore diverse enforcement strategies over evolutionary time until a low-cost solution arises. Low costs to enforcement are further facilitated by power asymmetries. Enforcement can be enabled by a single powerful individual, such as a host who exercises control over symbionts, or by majority rule, such as within an animal society. There is also a role for pre-adaptations: pre-existing features of the biology of a system can enable enforcement and promote its effectiveness. Systems in which enforcement is not possible will be less likely to see increases in cooperation over evolutionary time, or they may even see cooperation fall away. It is in those systems where enforcement does arise that we see the full extent, and wonders, of cooperative evolution." - [Enforcement is central to the evolution of cooperation](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41559-019-0907-1)

> "Exponential tech is inexorable. We cannot put it away. So, we either figure out anti-rivalry, or we go extinct. The human experiment comes to a completion. That’s the core thing." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://www.sloww.co/daniel-schmachtenberger/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAs%20technology%20is%20empowering%20our%20choices%20and%20we%20are%20getting%20something%20like%20the%20power%20of%20gods%2C%20you%20have%20to%20have%20something%20like%20the%20love%20and%20the%20wisdom%20of%20gods%20to%20wield%20that%20or%20you%20self%2Ddestruct.%E2%80%9D)


> "The concept of "multipolar traps" offers a fascinating and sobering lens through which to view certain aspects of human behavior and decision-making. It's a term rooted in game theory, yet it applies to a surprisingly broad array of real-world situations. So, what is a multipolar trap, and why is it so important? Imagine playing a game where everyone loses. Sounds bleak, doesn't it? Yet, that's precisely what a multipolar trap entails. Stemming from the principles of game theory, a multipolar trap is a scenario in which multiple actors, following their individual rational choices, inevitably end up in a collectively harmful situation. But why use the term 'multipolar'? At its core, 'polar' signifies direction. In the context of this concept, it refers to the multiple directions - or rational choices - pursued by different actors. It's these distinct paths that lead to the regrettable shared outcome.
>
> ... Tragedy of the Commons
>
> Consider a shared pasture, free for all local herdsmen. Each herdsman, acting on the rational instinct to maximize profit, adds more cattle to the field. The short-term benefits are appealing; each additional cow brings more milk, meat, or hide. However, as each herdsman follows this individualistic strategy, the pasture is overgrazed. The grass dies, and soon, the once fertile commons turn into a barren field. The rational actions of individuals lead to a collectively harmful outcome: the depletion of a shared resource, leaving everyone worse off.
>
> Economics
>
> Free-market economies often become multipolar traps. Every business aims to maximize profit and market share, leading to aggressive competition. While this competition can drive innovation and efficiency, it can also result in a race to the bottom in areas such as labor standards or environmental protection. Businesses that seek to behave ethically often find themselves at a disadvantage against those willing to cut corners, creating a collective race towards an unsustainable future.
>
> Politics
>
> The Cold War-era arms race provides a stark example. Both the United States and the Soviet Union, in pursuit of national security, amassed increasingly large and destructive arsenals. Each escalation, rational from a national defense perspective, heightened the overall threat to global peace. Resources that could have been used for public goods like healthcare or education were instead spent on nuclear weapons, showcasing a regrettable shared outcome from individual rational choices.
>
> Climate Change
>
> In our modern era, global climate change is arguably the most pressing multipolar trap. Every country seeks economic development, often fueled by carbon-intensive industries. While this can boost individual nations' prosperity, the collective cost in terms of rising global temperatures and environmental destruction is staggering.
>
> ... Navigating Multipolar Traps in the Modern World
>
> The irony of multipolar traps is stark. They epitomize how rational decisions, instead of leading us to beneficial outcomes, often lock us into undesirable situations. They demonstrate a harsh truth: our individual perspectives, when multiplied across society, can steer us toward collective harm. So, where does this leave us?It urges us to acknowledge that our decisions echo beyond our immediate circles. We're woven into a vast network of actions and consequences, each reverberating with the choices of others. Multipolar traps aren't merely a theoretical concept; they're a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of unchecked self-interest. They remind us that the pursuit of common good requires more than isolated rational choices - it necessitates collective wisdom, empathy, and cooperation. In summary, the term 'multipolar trap' paints a powerful picture of the sometimes paradoxical relationship between individual rationality and collective wellbeing. By understanding it, we're better equipped to recognize these traps in our lives and the broader world. And in doing so, we might just find a way to navigate these traps more wisely. After all, isn't the first step toward escaping a trap acknowledging that it exists?" - [Unseen Battles: How Multipolar Traps Drive Our World, by Miles Rote](https://www.milesrote.com/blog/unseen-battles-how-multipolar-traps-drive-our-world)

So you've got to always cooperate by random drift. But if we'd always cooperate, now we can guess what happens next: we invite Always defect. You have oscillations here, you have a mathematical model of human history, of economic cycles, of ups and downs.

I cooperate with the people in the set and I try to join sets of successful individuals. So the extension to classical evolutionary game theory here is in classic evolutionary game theory, people imitate successful strategies.

> "In other words, cooperation in groups on a genetic basis tends to be self-destructive. This may be clarified by introducing the concept of an evolutionary stable strategy. The strategy of the altruists, helping others even if they do not reciprocate the help, may lead to an increased fitness for the group but it is not stable, since it can be easily invaded by egoistic strategies that take advantage of the altruists' sacrifice, but without giving anything in return. Though the selfish strategies will globally lead to a decrease of fitness for the group, they are locally stronger than the altruist strategies. This is another expression of the principle of suboptimization: genetic evolution works at the level of the subsystem (the individual or the individual together with his kin), and what is optimal at that level will be selected, even though it is far from optimal at the level of the group. Campbell has summed up this predicament by the phrase "genetic competition among the cooperators": on the level of the genes rivalry continues, and that will eventually erode any cooperation on the level of the group." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Selection for reciprocal altruism
>
> The characteristics of "tit for tat" (and of the other more successful strategies) can be summarized by three concepts: 1) the strategy is "nice": this means that it will never be the first to defect; 2) the strategy is "provocable": if the opponent defects, it retaliates by defecting too; 3) the strategy is "forgiving": as soon as the opponent cooperates again, the strategy forgets about the previous defection, and cooperates.
>
> Niceness is advantageous because it opens the way to mutually beneficial cooperation. Retaliation is necessary in order to avoid being invaded by selfish profiteers. Forgivingness has the advantage of avoiding mutual rounds of retaliation. Indeed, suppose that an individual because of distrust, by way of test or just because of a misunderstanding would defect just once, then a non- forgiving strategy would continue to defect in reaction, and mutual cooperation could never emerge or be restored.
>
> In a second study Axelrod generalized his game theoretic simulation to an evolutionary setting. In this setting, fitness was explicitly introduced by giving a strategy an amount of offspring proportional to the number of points it got in the previous tournament. The tournament was then repeated by playing all members of the new population of strategies (in which more successful strategies were now more numerous) against each other. Again the points of this tournament were used to produce a second generation of offspring. This generation played a following tournament, and so on. After many generations the less successful strategies would have been eliminated by natural selection, while the most successful ones would become more and more numerous. This setting is not equivalent to the previous one, since the fitness of the strategies depends on the opponents against which they play, and the field of opponents changes in the course of the simulated evolution. Hence a strategy that is successful in the original field of opponents may no longer be fit after the field has drastically changed. Yet Axelrod found out that it was still "tit for tat" that was most successful.
>
> However, "tit for tat" does not turn out to be an evolutionary stable strategy in the strict sense. Indeed, once the field is dominated by "tit for tat", other strategies that are less retaliatory (or more forgiving) become as fit as "tit for tat" since there are no longer cheaters to take advantage from their unconditional altruism. However, once a sufficient percentage of strategies becomes too altruistic, selfish strategies can again gain in fitness by exploiting their altruism. The end result seems to be some kind of equilibrium mixture of strategies in which reciprocal altruists such as "tit for tat" dominate, but in which there may also appear small amounts of "nasty" (the opposite of "nice") strategies together with non-retaliating altruists.
>
> In how far can these simulation results be generalized to real evolution? The most important restriction in the experiment seems to be that opponents interact with each other for a long, consecutive sequence of exchanges. This may be true for two individuals engaged in a close and stable relation. Reciprocal altruism may thus explain how a symbiotic relationship between two organisms can develop (e.g. a hermit crab and the sea anemone living on its shell) (cf. Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). In the kind of situations involving a large number of individuals that interest us, on the other hand, it seems more likely that opponents will encounter each other only once, or now and then with long interruptions and exchanges with different opponents in between.
>
> "Tit for tat" is only successful in an indefinitely repeated prisoner's dilemma. If there is only one transaction, no retaliation is possible afterwards, and rationality dictates that you should defect. If there is a finite number of transactions, it pays to defect during the last one, but if you expect your opponent to defect at the last one, you should also defect at the last-but-one, and hence your opponent would be wise to already defect at the last-but-two, and so on. Hence games with a fixed number (known by the participants) of transactions would lead to continuous defection. In practice, that does not seem to be the problem, since normally opponents do not know how often they will meet each other again.
>
> However, the basic practical limitation is that of memory: the reciprocal altruist should not only remember how his opponent treated him during the last transaction (which may be a long time ago) he should also be able to recognize and distinguish all opponents with whom he has ever had transactions. This requirement does not seem to be realistic in large groups, such as human societies. Moreover, in such large systems, many encounters will take place for the first (and perhaps the last) time. In such cases reciprocal altruism does no good, and the "nice" individual who starts by cooperating may be cheated most of the time by others he will never see again. When I buy something in a shop in a city where I will never come back again, I do not expect to be cheated (though that is possible of course), even though I have no power to retaliate. In conclusion, reciprocal altruism seems still insufficient to explain the ultrasociality of human society." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The basic weakness of reciprocal altruism in explaining ultrasociality is that it starts from dyadic relationships, of the type "I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine". It is difficult to imagine how such one-to-one exchanges could be enlarged in order to form the basis for large collective organizations. Therefore we would like to see some evolutionary stable strategy that directs behaviour towards groups rather than towards other individuals.
>
> It has been proposed that one such strategy is moralism, that is to say behavior that rewards or reinforces altruistic behavior by others, and punishes or inhibits cheating or defection. For example, Trivers (1971) has postulated selection for "moralistic aggression", and Lorenz (1975) speaks about "innate ethical sense". The advantage of moralism compared to pure altruism is that the costs of moralizing towards others are clearly less than those of being altruistic yourself (Campbell, 1983). However, if everybody around you is continuously moralizing, and ready to ostracize or even kill you if you do not behave altruistically, it becomes quite difficult to behave in a selfish way. Hence groups consisting of moralizing individuals will also tend to be altruistic, though the individuals are not motivated to be altruistic on their own. Moralism is also more stable than real altruism because cheaters will find it very difficult to invade a population that tends to make their life as difficult as possible. A disadvantage of moralism is that it encourages hypocrisy, that is to say behavior that does everything to look altruistic but is in fact selfish.
>
> A basic weakness of the argument is that it is difficult to imagine how something as complicated as an "ethical sense" might develop through genetic evolution. It seems quite difficult to put down rules distinguishing moral or altruistic behavior from selfish behavior that are applicable to all situations and all individuals. We might perhaps imagine the evolution of simple behavior patterns such as aggressive reactions against the selfish wolf who does not want the others of the pack to share in the food, but that does not seem sufficient to explain ultrasociality.
>
> Another weakness of the moralistic selection argument, is that moralism mainly functions to maintain an already functioning cooperation system, by reducing the fitness of those who do not obey the rules. However, the argument does not explain how the cooperative pattern, and the moralistic attitude that maintains it, may have developed from selfish behavior in the first place." - [Evolution, Selfishness and Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The theory of natural selection on the basis of fitness is in principle applicable to all replicating systems, not only to genes. Recently, a new type of replicator has been proposed as a unit of cultural evolution. Memes are defined as cognitive or behavioral patterns that can be transmitted from one individual to another one by learning and imitation (Dawkins, 1976; Moritz, 1991). Examples of memes in the animal world are most bird songs, and certain techniques for hunting or using tools that are passed from parents or the social group to the youngsters (Bonner, 1980). In human society, almost any cultural entity can be seen as a meme: religions, language, fashions, songs, techniques, scientific theories and concepts, conventions, traditions, etc. The defining characteristic of memes as informational patterns, is that they can be replicated in unlimited amounts by communication between individuals, independently of any replication at the level of the genes. Storing a concept or a habit in memory after having encountered it through another individual, does not require any change of the DNA." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Though that process will be subjected to the same basic principles of blind variation and natural selection on the basis of fitness, memetic evolution is basically a much more flexible mechanism. Genes can only be transmitted from parents (or parent in the case of asexual reproduction) to offspring. Memes can in principle be transmitted between any two individuals (though it will become more difficult the larger the differences in cognitive mechanisms and language are).
>
> For genes to be transmitted, you typically need one generation, which for higher organism means several years. Memes can be transmitted in the space of hours. Meme spreading is also much faster than gene spreading, because gene replication is restricted by the rather small number of offspring a single parent can have, whereas the amount of individuals that can take over a meme from a single individual is almost unlimited. Moreover, it seems much easier for memes to undergo variation, since the information in the nervous system is more plastic than that in the DNA, and since individuals can come into contact with much more different sources of novel memes. On the other hand, selection processes can be more efficient because of "vicarious" selection: the meme carrier himself does not need to be killed in order to eliminate an inadequate meme; it can suffice that he witnesses or hears about the troubles of another individual due to that same meme.
>
> The conclusion is that memetic evolution will be several orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than genetic evolution. It should not surprise us then that during the last ten thousand years, humans have almost not changed on the genetic level, whereas their culture (i.e. the total set of memes) has undergone the most radical developments. In practice the superior "evolvability" of memes would also mean that in cases where genetic and memetic replicators are in competition, we would expect the memes to win in the long term, even though the genes would start with the advantage of a well- established, stable structure." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Meme fitness will depend basically on three factors: 1) survivability of the carrier; 2) individual learnability of memes; 3) tendency of memes to spread or to be transmitted. The first criterion is similar to the one determining gene selection, so we won't go into much detail about it. Basically it states that, all other things being equal, memes leading to decreased probability of a carrier's survival, e.g. because they are bad for the health, or lead to dangerous or suicidal behavior, will tend to be eliminated. However, we must add that survival is to be interpreted on the level of the group of all carriers, rather than on the level of the individual." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is this contagiousness that most strikingly differentiates meme selection from gene selection. Genes, indeed, are not contagious. You can never get a gene, that you did not already have, from someone else. At most you can produce a child that shares some of your genes with some genes of another person." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "All memes have the implicit goal of making their carriers more fit, since an increased number of carriers signifies that there will be more memory space available for meme replication. If, as we have argued previously, cooperation among the carriers tends to increase the overall fitness of the group of carriers, it will be in the interest of memes to promote that cooperation. Moreover, since cooperation requires communication, and since meme spreading critically depends on communication, the "motivation" of memes to bolster cooperation should be even stronger than that of genes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The selective advantage does not mean that the less fit group will be physically eliminated during the competition with the cooperative group. On the level of memes, elimination can happen when the selfish group gives up its belief in the meme for selfishness and adopts the meme for altruism from the other group. This conversion of one group by another one may happen by direct physical force, for example because the altruist group is better organized to win a war between the groups, and can thus subdue the other one. It can also happen in a peaceful way because the less successful group simply imitates the more successful one.
>
> The basic argument against group selection is that group strategies can be easily invaded. However, that is not the case for memetic strategies. Indeed, suppose that a "mutant" meme promoting selfishness would appear in an altruist group. According to genetic reasoning, its carrier would be more fit than an altruist one, since he can profit from the altruism of the other carriers without paying the corresponding costs. However, the fitness of a meme is different from the fitness of its carrier. Though the selfish carrier might have enhanced fitness in the sense that he gets more food or other resources, the fitness of the meme he carries depends on how easily other members of the group can be converted to it.
>
> Now memes are selfish, which means that they have the implicit goal of thwarting all rival memes that compete for the same memory space. Hence the majority meme in the group will tend to consolidate the memory space it already occupies in the majority of carriers. A likely mechanism for that might be that the different carriers continuously reinforce each other's belief by communication and imitation. The carrier of the mutant meme, on the other hand, is alone and does not get any reinforcement from his fellows. He will find it very difficult to convert any of them to his non-conformist ideas, since the influence on any individual of a majority of conformists will be much stronger than that of a single dissident. This tendency of the majority meme to impose itself on minorities leads to intra-group homogeneity, as confirmed by Boyd and Richerson's (1985) mathematical model of cultural evolution" - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Memes will even succeed in transcending the problem of the genetic competition between the cooperators... Our criticism of the argument on the basis of moralism, namely that a complete ethical system seems too complex to evolve by genetic selection, does not apply to memetic evolution, which is much faster, and which adapts more readily to abstract models of the world." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "When two individuals, after sufficient interactions, have reached a stable cooperative relationship or pact, based on reciprocity, that agreement or convention can be viewed as a meme with two carriers. If there is communication, that same meme can be transferred to a third and a fourth carrier, and so on, who would thus come to join the convention. Indeed, an individual who observes an existing reciprocal relationship between two other individuals, and who notices the advantages following from their mutual cooperation, would be tempted to imitate their behavior. If a certain behavioral pattern tends to be imitated, that makes it a meme by definition. If that meme, in addition to it being contagious, also furthers the genetic fitness of its carriers, we may conclude that it has a high memetic fitness, and thus will tend to replace rival memes with a lower fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The limitations on memory that make reciprocity difficult for large groups, can also be evaded by memetic mechanisms. Indeed, a meme can easily evolve mechanisms for making members of the same cultural group easy to recognize. Individuals belonging to the same culture or ethnical group will usually distinguish themselves by clearly perceivable attributes or behavior... If such signs allow you to identify a member of your group, you can expect that he will also follow the group's agreement on reciprocity, and hence you can trust that he will cooperate, without you having to renegotiate a pact. If he does not, you can still alarm the other members of your group, and he will be subjected to moralistic aggression. In that sense it is to the advantage of both the group and separate individuals to wear the appropriate attributes." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "Many ethical systems explicitly refer to the ideal of "fraternity", and sometimes members of the same cultural group (e.g. monks or Freemasons) are supposed to call each other "brother". Though these are not brothers in the biological sense, the meme attempts to harness the innate tendency to behave altruistically towards kin and to use it for purposes different from the increase of genetic inclusive fitness." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is possible to discern a clear progression from pure selfishness, to kin-restricted limited altruism, to "tit for tat" based dyads, to multi-individual reciprocal agreements, to moralism and group ideologies, and finally to the complex ultrasocial systems of cooperation characterizing present society." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "With the capacity for language appears the capacity to rapidly spread complex memes, and that gives memes a definite advantage over genes in directing further evolution. In recent times, the memes that seem to be dominating are those that tend to make the ideal of altruism or brotherliness universal, ignoring the distinctions created by older memes such as languages or religions. We will not go into detail about why that is happening but note that the evolutionary tendency towards more and more far-reaching or inclusive cooperation seems to continue, albeit with many ups and downs. Such an evolution towards stronger integration of subsystems, allowing optimization at the global level, is exemplified by Turchin's concept of a metasystem transition. Such an evolutionary transition is characterized by the appearance of a control system at the metalevel, steering and optimizing the actions of the subsystems at the level below." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "A basic conclusion of our general analysis is that you need communication before you can have cooperation, that is to say information must be shared. In organisms cooperating because of kin selection, the medium of communication is sexual reproduction: genetic "messages" are transmitted through special cells (sperm or egg cells) that cannot survive or develop independently of the process of sexual reproduction. It is this shared information that creates the connection between parents and offspring or, indirectly, between relatives. In primitive multicellular organisms, such as algae, the "communication" might be based on simple spatial contiguity (sharing of the same location). In complex organisms where there is differentiation of functions among cells, you need special chemical signals to coordinate the different cells (this can be modelled by "genetic networks", Kauffmann, 1991). In sociocultural systems, the basic medium supporting cooperation is meme spreading." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "The complete evolutionary sequence would be something of the following form: competition, communication, stable interaction patterns, internal models of pattern, shared models, shared replicators, cooperation promoted by shared replicators, integration with the shared replicators as coordinators. In Turchin's terminology, the shared information will become a control for the systems of the level below, coordinating, monitoring and directing their cooperation. Hence the process of development of cooperation between initially competing subsystems through the development of shared replicators can be seen as a true metasystem transition." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)

> "It is clear that the whole issue of how competing subsystems can start to cooperate and thus become (partly or completely) integrated into a globally optimizing supersystem is very complex. Many questions about cooperation, shared information, and higher levels of control still have to be answered. Yet I think it is equally obvious that these problems are of the utmost importance if we wish to understand our own further evolution, as individuals, as a species, as a culture, or as parts of the global world system." - ['Selfish' Memes and the Evolution of Cooperation, by Francis Heylighen](http://pcp.vub.ac.be/Papers/MemesCooperation.pdf)
