<p>Engelbart’s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time.”
https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart</p>
<p>on identity: “each time we go from one social network to another we do not need to restate who we are, what our interests are, or who we
know”
Note this article on the dangers of the possible commercial centralization of identity was written before Facebook was even founded.
&quot;as of 2018 the consolidation of power and control over the social web by a few large corporations seems unparalleled&quot;
&quot;Yet given programmers had over ten years to address the centralization of social data, why did these efforts fail? To a large extent, the key failing is that the programmers tried to solve the problem of centralization via the purely technical means of standards rather than taking into account the larger social, economic, and political world into which their code was embedded.&quot;
https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document</p>
<p>&quot;Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level.&quot;

<p>true uncensorability. The next philosopher to push humanity forward will be anonymous and global. Imagine not checking out what others are checking out more and more - what are the trends. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE what others are finding most interesting. Most people are rational - let's see what gets the most attention from everyone.</p>

<p>solving the cold start problem</p>
<p>the interest graph along with the recommender algorithms orchestrate how ideas surface, propagate, compound &amp; evolve</p>
<p>human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point - everything important is in our culture &amp; competition happens between ideas. We are building our digital history on shifting sands - there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true. There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible &amp; indexable. A global append-only log for data doesn't have the same requirements as a financial system which needs 100% uptime. The only thing that needs incentivization is data availability &amp; the ability for anyone to offer. There can be different modes of posting - maybe just a hash for content that could be on ipfs and whose contents might have different levels of storage guarantees.</p>
<p>We need everything that needs to bubble up to the top to do so.
sequencing &amp; discoverability is valuable. The ability for any piece of information to bubble up TO THE ABSOLUTE TOP is.. VALUABLE</p>
<p>information theory and physics are interlinked. In the physical world signals traverse based on the natural laws but memetic ideas spread thanks to human-manipulated means - we don't have fair means of dissipation of information. We can't make sense of the world together. We can't coordinate</p>
<p>The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come - steve jobs</p>
<p>Finance and media are the bedrock of society.</p>
<p>bring back the nansi pelosi portfolio tracker</p>
<p>the only way to pay for open data is to make a currency that whoever owns it benefits from being on it. Make the voice of people unsilence-able - something pops up - immediately a few people copy it so even if the original goes down - the idea can be re-referenced by others anonymously - until it picks up steam and gets nocited by more</p>
<p>the trust machine may bootstrap the truth machine - where it is incentivized to pop up to the top and the only thing that makes things grow is actually being more interesting &amp; important. HEATMAP of links!</p>
<p>Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data &amp; being able to check the results for yourself</p>
<p>Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.</p>
<p>the same piece of data may pop up multiple times throughout time through different sources - unkillable evidence - one which may live offline for a period and resurface. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOBAL HASH INDEX OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EVER TAGGED?</p>
<p>I want to tag/link/index/sequence all data. I want the truth to bubble up.</p>
<p>&quot;Information wants to be free&quot;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free</p>
<p>we need to establish objective reality
we shouldn't need steven pinker to make lectures titled &quot;rationality saves lives&quot;
imagine developing a publicly-developed wiki where we collaborate on trying to figure out the best set of documents - the rules that everyone should see.</p>
<p>imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness. This is the unification</p>
<p>Linked data is essential for discoverability &amp; ingestion of information - this gitbook is an example of that - contrast to what it would be if it was a linear whitepaper. The whole web can be interlinked like this.</p>

<p>The Importance of Gossip Across Societies: Correlations With Institutionalization
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1069397114554383?journalCode=ccrc&amp;</p>
<p>Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed.

If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.</p>
<p>As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.</p>
<p>This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.</p>
<p>lets try to achieve consensus on ground truth with the ledger of record
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_truth</p>
<p>imagine the timelines &amp; graphs we'd be able to construct if we have a global sequencer</p>
<p>https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3
Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes.</p>
<p>Any of the mentioned articles or quotes by ppl like balaji should have been a notification or reference - everything should be interlinked</p>

<p>&quot;78 statements of why we need this&quot;
&quot;why we need this - 78 reasons&quot;</p>
<p>substack has it's own comment section.
sites that have segregated comment sections:</p>
<p>by making data and identity interoperable between views it gets much easier for people to peek outside of their areas of interest and perhaps get drawn into other aspects of the world. It's all interconnected in the real world anyway, why not interconnect all data too and let ppl swim towards whatever they wish?</p>
<p>If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide.
