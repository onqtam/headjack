Language is a poor medium - it evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago but now we can do a lot better.</p><p>What if we expressed our thoughts as directed graphs of ideas, entities &amp; concepts with weights, probabilities &amp; causal relationships?

What are the benefits?</p><ol><li><p>We could <strong>render</strong> our thoughts into different mediums: text, audio &amp; video through the use of LLMs &amp; generative AI - expanding the accessibility of our work beyond those that can view thought-graphs. A graph has many ways to be traversed so we can ask the AI to generate multiple versions. We could also specify a node path (which nodes/subgraphs and in what order) for the serialization into text and also paragraphs to be inserted at specific points (perhaps you want to write the introduction or conclusion yourself). We could also have fine-grained control such as annotating specific nodes to be skipped from the serialization or to signal their importance so that the AI adds more or less emphasis. We could have movie-maker-like software with a timeline where we orchestrate the traversal. This wasn&#x27;t possible until the recent advancements of LLMs &amp; AI.</p></li><li><p>Imagine being able to say &quot;<strong>view source</strong>&quot; of a text article and being shown the thought-graph that the author used to generate it. The serialized output could also have an automatically generated mapping so that we can see which regions correspond to which nodes &amp; links with some highlighting and we could have both displayed side by side for synchronized &quot;playback&quot;.</p></li><li><p>What about <strong>editing</strong>? Refactoring &amp; &quot;rewriting&quot; will be just a matter of moving &amp; reconnecting nodes &amp; subgraphs, followed by a re-render of the outputs by the AI.</p></li><li><p>We could generate <strong>change reports</strong> &amp; summaries for a thought-graph throughout time.</p></li><li><p>We could <strong>debug / fact-check</strong> the logic in the circuits of thought-graphs. Choose ontologies &amp; fact databases and evaluate the connections of a graph for logical consistency against them.</p></li><li><p>We could <strong>pattern-match</strong> our thought-graphs with others and we could compute the similarity of (sub)graphs and track the provenance &amp; plagiarism of ideas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discoverability</strong> - the better you annotate your thought-graph with well-known &amp; widely used semantic web concepts &amp; ontologies - the easier it will be to discover your content.

(connected to changing the titles for less clickbait)</p><p>We should be able to see all references &amp; content related to any identity, event/document or entity/concept/noun as a collection of comments, reactions/votes, annotations, redirections and edits/forks which we could organize &amp; filter through the UI. Examples:</p><ol><li><p>Some YouTube videos have comments disabled. Why? Could be many reasons: <strong>1)</strong> perhaps they don&#x27;t want to have their content associated with low quality comments, <strong>2)</strong> maybe they don&#x27;t like the <a href="https://prnt.sc/ORguwjXfLgLR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scammers &amp; bots</a> and want to protect their audience, <strong>3)</strong> maybe they haven&#x27;t fully thought this through, <strong>4)</strong> or maybe they are actively trying to hide something. But anything public can be discussed on other platforms (Reddit?) - all you&#x27;ve done is made it harder to find that discussion but it&#x27;s still there (and is most likely fractured across different platforms/subreddits). The valid reasons (<strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>) can be negated with better tooling for content moderation - both for active participants (tagging, annotating, voting) &amp; the passive ones (simply consuming &amp; filtering through the UI).</p></li><li><p>What if we could provide alternative titles for content and crowdsource the ones which most accurately describe it - countering the clickbait? Users could choose to view the original titles or the crowdsourced versions if there&#x27;s consensus for a specific title to be way better than the original. This is already happening in StackOverflow - titles of other people&#x27;s posts can be edited by moderators (or anyone?) with the goal of improving accuracy. What constitutes &quot;better&quot; and which/how votes are counted can be configurable too. But wouldn&#x27;t content creators object?! Sure, but what are they going to do? But data can be composed in any way imaginable in the Giant Global Graph. This is like taking the best comment about what a post/video should be titled and through something like a browser extension programatically using that instead of the original in the UI - you can&#x27;t stop that. We could even calculate clickbait scores for content creators - I bet many would have more than 90% of their content re-titled according to some criteria. We could even feed such scores into recommendation algorithms - <strong>disincentivizing clickbait</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>TODO:
Deceiving others to watch your content just for your own good is narcissistic - are we seeking knowledge or do we want to feed and grow narcissism?</p><ol><li><p>The perpetual AMA (Ask Me Anything) - currently only a small handful of people have done <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMAs in Reddit</a> that last only up to a few days with an extremely limiting interface in a sporadic/random fashion. What if every account had an implicit AMA associated with them (something like <a href="https://ask.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ask.fm</a> but a lot more powerful) and we could ask any leader/CEO/celebrity &amp; hyper agent questions with special message types and link them to their accounts? We could collectively surface the most pressing ones and make it glaringly obvious if the important ones aren&#x27;t answered or if the answer is of poor quality - through different dashboards/charts &amp; sorting/filtering. We could hold them to higher standards &amp; more scrutiny. What if we could pressure companies &amp; CEOs about the use of Cobalt from African mines with slave labor? Doing a poll on <a href="https://change.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">change.org</a> is extremely ineffectual, but if something like it was integrated with a new more expressive type of social media for virality - it could have drastically different results. It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same interconnected identity &amp; data network.</p></li><li><p>Reactions that relate to a piece of content. Let&#x27;s take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPOcBVzm7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&quot;Jillian Michaels: Don&#x27;t believe the keto diet hype | Big Think&quot;</code></a> video for example. How do we determine if what&#x27;s in there true? All we have is a comment section and a sidebar with algorithmic recommendations. Turns out there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jillian+michaels+keto+reaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of reactions</a> but they&#x27;re not shown next to the video in any way - how would we know about their existence if we didn&#x27;t explicitly search for them? The goal is not to be exposed to multiple points of view &amp; reach some conclusion - it&#x27;s only engagement. The videos are not interlinked, but suppose they were - we could have a list of reactions displayed along with scores of disagreement and other factors and we could more easily discern which one to watch next. </p></li><li><p>Take the YouTube playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC9lvrBhVt4UUkhzpp3N5_x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory | Computer Science | Khan Academy&quot;</code></a> for example. The videos are out of order, but someone has made another playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq2EDMGUqkHHjHLhp88RY-e5mN7uGMP75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory (in order)&quot;</code></a> that is fixed. This is essentially a fork - one that is better than the original. Why can&#x27;t we see a crowdsourced redirection suggestion attached to the original?</p></li></ol><p>A unified identity layer, the ability to deduplicate content, to annotate semantically &amp; the move to structured data greatly helps with being able to pull everything related to something. However, one concern is negative reputation &amp; &quot;scarlet letters&quot; - the ability to taint an entity and have the bad reputation follow it without the ability to hide it. But we can develop tools, norms &amp; criteria to evaluate/rank/filter any document &amp; reaction that relates to something. Moreover, even if there isn&#x27;t a direct data connection between 2 entities (one referring to the other), as long as they are both public someone could index them and make that link. This problem already exists today.</p><p>██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</p><h1>wikipedia</h1><p>██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</p><p>competing wikipedia-like pages written by different people &amp; being able to select between them? no more &quot;trusted source&quot; issues?</p><p>Wikipedia and different prisms
