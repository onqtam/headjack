The current problem is that we don&#x27;t have alternatives and that there&#x27;s no transparency.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;For as long as humans have crafted disembodied versions of their voices, whether it be Pompeiian graffiti or the latest tweet, there have been attempts to both guide user attention in some remunerative direction, and measure the effectiveness of that attention-gathering.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/everything-is-an-ad-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;The attention economy has always had its ledger and its cash register, and Web 3 will be no different.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/everything-is-an-ad-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>!! on data brokers

It&#x27;s much more than just bean-counting, though the bean-counting is important. It’s the capital ‘T’ Truth that the entire ecosystem depends on.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/why-spindle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;Internet monetization is somewhat like a Soviet election: It doesn’t matter who clicks and where, it’s who counts those clicks that matters. The technology and business of that counting of clicks (and everything else you do online besides) goes by the dull-sounding name of attribution, and it determines the fate of trillion-dollar companies.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>Let&#x27;s examine the following example:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A recent example of questionable attribution: I tweeted about my e-mountain bike, Jason Calacanis (of all people) saw it and asked about the model. Someone posted a review from bikeradar.com, and Jason (I don’t know if this is true) probably googled for it and maybe bought it. Who deserves the attributions credit? According to Google (surprise, surprise), it’ll be Google … and they’ll take all the credit, which is why Google is worth so much and Twitter so little.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>This entire flow could be tracked </p><p>Furthermore, attribution services could credit accounts that retweet content and add more interactions with it with some of the profits</p><p>de-duplication through content addressing &amp; adding traceability of content helps paint the picture what happened when and by who - aiding attribution. Infrastructure companies on which applications get deployed on can handle such tracking within them but since all the data is openly broadcasted competing services could offer alternative business models.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Whether it be circulation numbers for 19th-century newspapers (the start of the printed ads business), or Nielsen ratings for pre-cable TV that determined ads rates there, there’s never been a media ecosystem that didn’t have attribution.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;If you had to conjure some collective mechanism for storing aggregated data that was selectively shareable between publisher and advertiser, it would look much like a blockchain.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>^^ this can be done through verifiable computation &amp; sharing indexes between publishers &amp; advertisers within index infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This article</a> posits that attribution has to go on-chain but Headjack offers an alternative - through the infrastructure companies.</p><p>It is inevitable that mass media &amp; aggregation will be handled by centralized services that can save user details in logs - what we could do is make a market for user data and make it easier to opt out of such data harvesting with alternatives &amp; a way for whistleblowers to prove if a contract hasn&#x27;t been honoured.</p><p>composable media - pick a recommender algo, search, UI</p><p>the history of actions and tracked events would be private and shared only between infra platforms and ppl paying for ads?</p><p>Identity wants to emerge
Over the long run, any stable joinable key becomes an identity as it accumulates more correlated information about you.
We see this today in the ads ecosystem, where data brokers and cross-site advertising networks use data joining to correlate information about you and track you around the internet. Email addresses, cookies, IP addresses, advertising identifiers—anything that is unique and stable can be used for data joining.

This can serve as advertising for applications because even when a URI is viewed through competing ones, the original source should be displayed and there ought to be a way to view it through the original one - especially if the <a href="/docs/why/messages.md">message type</a> is not supported.</p><p>This can be a powerful way for new applications to get discovered - they can even pay creators to use them in order to attract new users and have their names in the URIs of content <strong>forever</strong>.</p><h1>Identity managers - the new storage cloud</h1><p><a href="/docs/why/IDM.md">IDMs</a> will be the central hub to store all user preferences, social graph, DMs, progress on long-form media, personal notes &amp; bookmarks, etc. But also pictures, videos and many other types of data - the one-stop shop for all things identity. There&#x27;ll be plenty of ways to provide free tiers and yet monetize for more heavy &amp; advanced use. Anyone will be able to host their own IDM.</p><p>IDMs could also provide a <a href="/docs/why/algorithms_feeds_aggregation#feeds--home-pages">feed</a> &amp; a home page similar to current social networks with the most &quot;relevant&quot; content for users and even serve ads, but there&#x27;ll be a lot more configuration options &amp; choice because all IDMs will be in competition with each other &amp; users will be able to migrate.</p><h1>Creator monetization</h1><p>creators will need to shift how they monetize because there won&#x27;t be platform lock-in &amp; attribution :/
or actually the application attribution for content naturally leads to users checking it out - creators can and should be paid to generate content through them and based on virality of content they could get paid out? omg.</p><h1>Video, long-form media &amp; streaming</h1><p>Let&#x27;s take YouTube for example: currently it is &amp; does many things at once: storage &amp; streaming of video, a recommendation system, serving ads, social features, subscriptions, etc.</p><p>In the brave new world of Headjack it would be completely unbundled</p><p>TODO:</p><ul><li>is the video hash uploaded?</li><li>embedded player required?</li><li>serving ads or just charging apps for the data streams?</li></ul><p>What if some platforms don&#x27;t freely provide the content but just anchor it and provide APIs like embedding youtube?</p><p>separate content hosting &amp; delivery from the recommendation system and the serving of ads</p><p>streaming</p><h1>The future of influencer marketing</h1><p>Currently, companies cannot target you directly with ads without the social media platforms as middlemen - but with open data, any company could analyze the world and decide what their target audience is.
Currently, Coca-Cola targets audiences with the same ad but with some precision - imagine if they could directly target individuals with tailor-made ads based on them - what if an algorithm picks up that you&#x27;re gay and coca cola send you an ad with a shirtless male (if you&#x27;re male) - point taken from Yuval Noah Harari here: <a href="https://youtu.be/j0uw7Xc0fLk?t=260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/j0uw7Xc0fLk?t=260</a></p><p>Imagine influencers being able to use algorithms to generate synthetic versions of themselves pitching different products to different people and having the application infrastructure serve different versions to different people based on who they are. The influencer is the magnet and the algorithms are the tailors. This is the future whether we like it or not. The good thing about an unbundled media stack is that some services will let you avoid ads for a subscription fee.</p><p>Influencer marketing is the end game</p><h1>The first mover advantage &amp; the transition</h1><p>No other solution has a seamless way to address content on http and bridge with traditional dns</p><p>traditional web2 companies/apps/websites will be able to gradually transition and anchor their content into this namespace - cost of entry would be marginal and the first to do so would get indexed and start getting shown in search results in this ecosystem first</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/what">Main documentation</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/8ZDs5Mv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/onqtam/headjack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Headjack Logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--light_HNdA footer__logo"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Headjack Logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--dark_i4oU footer__logo"></div><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Headjack, Inc.
