But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet. And counter to the beliefs of the biggest web3 critics, web3 does allow you to build real, open, and neutral protocols.&quot; - <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0xE4f646F0Be4fF5ce185540F5366295f91d75b65D/-xpmr7ceHmi5Hqsl7zRtig9ph_dtCvWjZOoWOVN0bcg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><h1>The cold start problem for startups</h1><p>The barrier to entry for most types of platforms is very high:</p><ul><li>kickstarting a network effect &amp; attracting a critical mass is very difficult</li><li>need to reinvent the wheel &amp; <a href="/docs/why/TODO.md#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertically integrate</a> many aspects instead of composing a service from already existing solutions</li></ul><p>And thus few companies are started and even fewer are successful - leading to little innovation, slow progress &amp; sub-par services.</p><p>Check out the <a href="/docs/why/startup_case_study">startup case study</a> expanding on why it would be easier with Headjack.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/what">Main documentation</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.gg/8ZDs5Mv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/onqtam/headjack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Headjack Logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--light_HNdA footer__logo"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="Headjack Logo" class="themedImage_ToTc themedImage--dark_i4oU footer__logo"></div><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 Headjack, Inc.
