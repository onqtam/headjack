The only way to make something truly self-authenticating in perpetuity is to timestamp it. Anchor it. Sequence a set inclusion commitment on-chain.</p><h1>History 2.0: the ledger of record</h1><p>In the current web documents are <a href="/headjack/docs/why/host_centric#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">host-certified</a> and we refer to data by location instead of contents. Here we&#x27;ll expand on problems with the status quo and list the benefits of building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web of trust</a> at web-scale through <a href="/headjack/docs/why/host_vs_data_centric.md">data-centric</a> addressing &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-authenticating</a> documents tied to identity.</p><h1>Authenticity</h1><p>We&#x27;ll be able to computationally verify the authenticity of any document &amp; tie it to an identity as long as we also have the proofs for it - giving birth to the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ledger of record</a> where argument from cryptography begins superseding argument from authority.</p><p>Anyone might have saved a specific document (&amp; updates to it) locally along with the necessary proofs for authenticity even if most infrastructure no longer stores/serves it. There is a <code>1 of N</code> guarantee which allows documents that someone wants buried to be passed around with proofs and resurface in the public at a later point - improving accountability.</p><h1>The global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a></h1><p>Headjack is a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version control system</a> with different data availability tradeoffs - storage and retrievability are not guaranteed. If someone processes everything that&#x27;s linked to the blockchain they&#x27;d be able to track the creation and changes of each document - both the edits from the original authors and the forks &amp; references from others, and also the sequence of authorizations that update who has authority to edit a document. All events are cryptographically sealed in time with on-chain commitments and the history cannot be tampered with.</p><p>We should be able to view the changes of any document with a diff view - similarly to what <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Archive provides</a> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this as an example</a>) but with a lot more control and a wide range of different visualization tools - example: a slider for filtering/jumping through time <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like in Discourse</a>.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The public’s interest in seeing what’s changed—or at least being aware that a change has been made and why—is as legitimate as it is diffuse. And because it’s diffuse, few people are naturally in a position to speak on its behalf.&quot; - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>We ought to rebuild everything on top of this <a href="/headjack/docs/why/cryptohistory#authenticity">ledger of record</a> - including Wikipedia (no more dead links!), open source code, science and peer review - under one global interlinked namespace where any public event is referencable so that others can comment on it.</p><h1>The history of document updates</h1><p>Today&#x27;s web puts authenticity &amp; certification of documents in the <a href="/headjack/docs/why/host_centric#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">hands of hosts</a> which can <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27690525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do whatever they want</a> and rarely provide the option to see previous versions if edits have been made. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Archive</a> is hardly a mainstream tool which doesn&#x27;t provide any cryptographic authenticity guarantees and can be compromised.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It is really tempting to cover for mistakes by pretending they never happened.

It’s long overdue to affirm and enact the policies and technologies that will let us see where we’ve been, including and especially where we’ve erred, so we might have a coherent sense of where we are and where we want to go.&quot; - <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></p></blockquote><p>In Headjack updates to URIs are broadcasted but the previous versions remain - applications ought to display the latest state but should allow browsing the entire history of changes - like using Git.</p><h1>Deduplicating documents &amp; traceability</h1><p>An open paradigm with content addressing where data is shared between services would enable us to de-duplicate re-uploads as long as they are the same documents in terms of bytes because of the open nature of data - based on their hash. We&#x27;ll be able to see when something first appeared &amp; the discussion will be much less fractured between platforms and posts - leading to greater depth.</p><p>We&#x27;ll be able to more easily <a href="/headjack/docs/why/names_and_paths.md#addressing-within-content">address parts of documents</a> and share ranges of entire videos without having to re-upload them as separate clips which breaks the contextual link. If this becomes as easy as (or even easier than) it currently is to crop &amp; re-upload, then it will become the norm - we&#x27;ll all prefer not losing the context. In this paradigm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deepfakes</a> will be easier to spot &amp; fight - tracing the source of content authentically to identity is important &amp; desirable.</p><p>TODO: regarding deepfakes - only official statements could be traced - unofficial leaks will still be unprovable</p><h1>Verifiable credentials</h1><p>Entities can sign messages that attest facts about other accounts - the creation of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verifiable credentials</a> doesn&#x27;t have to happen on-chain - they can be issued off-chain with a message that&#x27;s only anchored on-chain and has a URI. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html#modifying-and-revoking-attestations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&quot;issuance is common, revocation is rare&quot;</code></a> - later revocations &amp; updates can be handled in one of 2 ways:</p><ul><li>On-chain revocation/updates: if the attestations are uniquely numbered with a counter from the issuer using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nonce</a>, then the Headjack state can be extended to support a special <code>revocation list</code> field in which the chain can record revocations at specific blocks - then the validity of said attestations will be checkable with a single query to the blockchain state. For updates there would be a second list and in order to check the validity for an attestation after an update has been recorded for its nonce, users would need to fetch the off-chain anchored message corresponding to the update at the block at which it was flagged. The blockchain may charge periodic fees for state rent for these lists.</li><li>Fully off-chain: in which case there will be some liveness assumptions around the issuer for checking if an attestation has been revoked/updated.</li></ul><h1>Reputation systems</h1><p><a href="https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1651394338012766208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1651394338012766208</a></p><blockquote><p>&quot;Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today.&quot; - <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</a></p></blockquote><p>We don&#x27;t need oracles, tokens, automatic on-chain settlement &amp; markets through smart contracts to build reputation systems for predictions &amp; promises - all we need is to immutably sequence predictive messages that are authentically linked to identity and plot the results - the open nature of the data would disincentivize platforms to display it incorrectly which is enough - we trust block explorers after all.</p><p>Take the <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tipranks</a> platform as an example - we can generalize it for anyone in the world - not just for certified financial advisors. The reality is that millions of people are effectively guilty of shilling, despite some preficing it with the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1552968186605490176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>&quot;this is not financial advice&quot;</code></a>. We can self-regulate the crypto &amp; financial industries bottom-up in a decentralized way - steps:</p><ol><li>come up with the base set of extensible prediction message types</li><li>build the tools that plot predictions versus a price feed</li><li>demand that influencers use the specific types of messages for predictions</li><li>refuse to listen to accounts that don&#x27;t use that format and build the habit to check track records before listening to someone - this can (and will) become a social norm</li><li>let the <a href="https://twitter.com/TSLAgang/status/1433896307702353921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chips fall where they may</a></li></ol><p>Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have &quot;fallback&quot; translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don&#x27;t support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema <code>42</code> can have the following template for serialization: <code>&quot;{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}&quot;</code>, and thus a basic application that encounters <code>{message_type: &quot;42&quot;, asset: &quot;$BTC&quot;, date: &quot;2025.02.12&quot;, above_or_below: &quot;above&quot;, price: &quot;100000$&quot;, probability: &quot;80%&quot;}</code> could render <code>&quot;$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12&quot;</code>. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there&#x27;s no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.</p><p>The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Finally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust. Self-authenticated data can retain metadata, like who published something and whether it was changed. Reputation and trust-graphs can be constructed on top of users, content, and services. The transparency provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">verifiable computation</a> provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced. We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.&quot; - <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bluesky</a></p></blockquote><h1>Science, peer review &amp; <a href="https://future.com/what-is-decentralized-science-aka-desci/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeSci</a></h1><p>aseem malhotra - statins overperscribed and how were the original studies carried out in terms of excluding those with side effects and what the actual efficacy really is</p><p>how inefficient is reading papers? aren&#x27;t they bloated in some respects? couldn&#x27;t we express ideas as linked graphs so that the &quot;reader&quot; (explorer) could choose which nodes to inspect - without having to go through paragraphs ot text because they can&#x27;t easily navigate to the novel parts in the big wall of text</p><p>academia resembles feudalism</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html</a></p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat</a></p><blockquote><p>&quot;Corollary 5: The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.&quot; - <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124#:~:text=Corollary%205%3A%20The%20greater%20the%20financial%20and%20other%20interests%20and%20prejudices%20in%20a%20scientific%20field%2C%20the%20less%20likely%20the%20research%20findings%20are%20to%20be%20true." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Most Published Research Findings Are False, by John P.
