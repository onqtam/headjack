Systems like MACI can prevent you from credibly selling your vote, by allowing you to later cast another vote that invalidates your previous vote, in such a way that no one can tell whether or not you in fact cast such a vote. However, if the briber controls which key you get at registration time, this does not help.

Instead of trying to accurately communicate a story that properly reflects known information, facts and evidence are cherry-picked to fit the preselected frame.</p><p>...</p><p>Often frame control is much less concerned with logical persuasion or conveyance of particular facts than with controlling the interpretive framework in which the whole story can be understood. Rather than make a logical argument, particular ideas and images are selected (or excluded), these are juxtaposed in a suggestive manner, leaving an emotional or moral impression that important claims have been settled. This is often true, even though certain other important claims and evidence that were not mentioned remain unsettled.</p><p>Best practices for media to avoid frame control include: <strong>Show as much data as you can that is relevant; orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed; know when fact checking is not enough; clarify what is important and why to justify focus; share multiple frames; acknowledge what is not known and where there is no basis for certainty; argue counter narratives and share facts that seem to support an alternative hypothesis</strong>&quot; - <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Frame%20control%20is,an%20alternative%20hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;<strong>Competing unverifiable claims result in a situation of narrative deadlock in which irreconcilable views become entrenched.</strong> There is no way out of deadlock until the competing narratives can be broken down into potentially verifiable elements, which can then become a focus of investigation by both parties. Absent an earnest assessment of the veracity of claims there is no way to resolve a dispute, and so the tactic of engagement often reverts into frame control rather than analysis and argumentation. Where the situation is such that we cannot verify or falsify key elements, then all parties should hold tentative beliefs with low enough confidence to not start “wars” over them. The ability to hold beliefs tentatively is important also for any person or group seeking to avoid confirmation bias.&quot; - <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=Competing%20unverifiable%20claims,avoid%20confirmation%20bias." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;To avoid being captured by polarization there must be awareness of the negative impacts of the dynamic, as well as the means by which it takes effect. Polarization involves not doing synthesis; it means being wrong or at least problematically partial. Polarization dynamics also result in orienting towards “war” rather than coordination. The dynamics sometimes stem from actual, explicit political alliances, but almost always involve appealing to the biases and emotions of an in-group against an out-group. The speed bias forcing sloppy work, as soundbites force a narrowing of perspectives and advertising revenues demand more clicks and longer times on page, reinforces polarization.&quot; - <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=To%20avoid%20being,page%2C%20reinforces%20polarization." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;It is possible to act in ways that decrease polarization. The media should explicitly differentiate, gauge, and discuss the plausibility of claims when presenting them. As complexity and polarization increases it becomes more important to show as much data as you can that is relevant, to orient to facts and how they can be investigated and framed, and to know when fact-checking is not enough. When narrowing focus, clarify what is important and essential to know, justify and explain why one story is being told rather than another. Polarization decreases to the extent that public culture is characterized by intelligent voices that are earnestly seeking out and articulating the views of all relevant groups as part of leading to understanding.&quot; - <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/were-pallets-of-bricks-planted-at-black-lives-matter-protests/#:~:text=it%20is%20possible,leading%20to%20understanding." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Were Pallets of Bricks Planted at Black Lives Matter Protests? - The Consilience Project</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&quot;<a href="https://pol.is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pol.is</a> is a digital platform for gathering and analyzing diverse opinions from large groups, and for then producing high-level, actionable, and statistically significant insights that can be plugged into offline processes.
