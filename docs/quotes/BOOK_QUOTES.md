We mean something analogous to the idea of social engineering, a concept that came about at the end of the 19th century that refers to the intentional design of specific social arrangements and ways of operating. The Reddit platform itself is not social technology, but its use of moderators is...
>
> It’s important to note that all except the simplest social technologies are designed. Though many of our crucial social technologies seem like natural parts of reality today, this was not always so. At some point they required intentional construction and adoption. Many social technologies we take for granted, including the very idea of having such critical systems as currency, law, and government, were born from concerted human agency. It is for this reason that we call it social technology, rather than social “norms”, or take a broader anthropological or philosophical approach. Much like material technology, social technology is designed, adopted, and scaled. It is proceduralized and documentable.

The giver and recipient collaborate to publicly assert that the recipient is worthy of prestige, and that the giver has the authority to grant it. Honors are thus acts of an alliance to mutually boost prestige...

> "If one looks closely at any society, one will observe that its rulers—and their prestige—subsidize all other sources of prestige. Thus, when the landscape of power shifts, the landscape of prestige shifts accordingly. It is then critical that rulers are incentivized to allocate prestige well—that is, in accordance with the actual distribution of excellence. If they aren’t, as in the case of Stalin, the resulting distortions in the allocation of prestige produce distortions in their society’s understanding of what is good and what is true. Lysenkoism was an epistemic and moral disaster. This kind of corruption can ultimately have catastrophic effects on the society’s health, because the ability to ascertain the truth is fundamental to the functionality of a society’s people and its institutions." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)
^^ not sure how to use this quote... maybe parts of it?

> "Among the many different kinds of honors, we can pick out two especially common ones: those meant to incentivize a particular achievement with a financial reward, which I call prizes, and those meant to afford prestige on the basis of past achievement, which I call awards. Prizes aim to get some specific thing done, whereas awards aim to affect the distribution of prestige, incentivizing achievement in a more indirect way. With a prize, money is fundamental. With an award, it is incidental. The Millennium Prizes are a prime example of the former, the Academy Awards of the latter.
>
> This distinction is often muddled, leading honors to be less effective than they could be. I have to clarify what I mean by each term, because in practice they aren’t used in a reliable way. There are awards that are called prizes and prizes that are called awards. Despite its name, the Nobel Prize is a hybrid case that is more of an award. Though it comes with a financial reward, it is primarily about affording prestige, and this is what those who try to win it are after. The money is nice, but the glory is better.
>
> It’s for this reason that I think that awards are more effective than prizes in incentivizing the production of knowledge. Glory is a greater motivator than money...
>
> A prize also provides less return on its creator’s investment of social capital than an award. Once the goal is achieved and the prize won, there is no longer a reason for it to exist. It is self-abolishing. An award, on the other hand, can continue to be given out year after year, compounding the investment of prestige." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "The more closely social status corresponds to activity that’s ultimately beneficial for society, the more such activity is incentivized, much more strongly than by even a large financial reward.

> "Status is one of the irreplaceable currencies whose necessary transfer is often denounced in this way. Michael Sauder et al. define status as the relative respect and patterns of deference accorded to people, groups and organizations by wider society... People cannot engage in any common projects without some commonly agreed-upon deference to people, groups or organizations, nor can they engage in common projects without someone or something holding, and yes, spending status. Status is a coordination mechanism, and this makes it valuable.
>
> If we come together to do great things, much status is required, whether vested in an institution or an individual. That someone will be holding status in this sense, personally or as a representative of an organization, then, is an unavoidable consequence of people coming together to do things. Perhaps one can argue for a dispersed distribution of status as the best way for us to organize such efforts, but the fact is that deference by some towards others on technical and resource distribution questions is still the central guiding factor." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

The key problems here are the creation and identification of sufficient skill, together with ensuring the next founder has inherited a position of sufficient power to remake the institution. Of course, even if the succession problem is handled once, it remains a problem for the next generation.
>
> If the succession problem remains unsolved, the only process of institutional reform available is the destruction of abandoned institutions by new ones, the process sometimes described as “creative destruction”. That our society valorizes rather than bemoans such outcomes unfortunately demonstrates that we have become accustomed to failed succession and notable dysfunction.

> "In the West today, we operate under the influence of our own key philosophy, which we can call scientism: the tendency to rely on scientific claims to describe the functioning of society, even when there is no empirical reason to assume that they apply. We act as if we are already living in a scientifically-planned society, immune to collapse on a timescale that any of us have to worry about. This is very far from the truth. We are certainly living in socially-engineered societies, but they are not scientifically planned in any straightforward way. Our organs of economic management do not secretly know how the economy really works. Our systems of political regulation are operating on the fumes of their institutional inheritance from two or three generations ago—the last spurt of institutional growth in Western societies happened roughly during the 1970s." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

> "Our society is dominated by large bureaucracies. These bureaucracies break down the processing of physical goods and information into discrete tasks, such as how a factory worker puts doors on a car, or a stock trader buys futures contracts. These tasks are shorn of their context and executed in a systematized environment whose constraints are quite narrow: put the car door in, increase the portfolio value. Our society is thoroughly compartmentalized. This compartmentalization isn’t driven by the division of labor, but rather by the need to make use of misaligned talent without empowering it. By radically limiting employees’ scope of action, you make office politics more predictable. By fragmenting available knowledge, you can leverage information asymmetries to the intellectual or material advantage of the center. Some of this is necessary for scaling organizations beyond what socially connected networks can manage—but move too far towards compartmentalization, and it becomes impossible to accomplish the original mission of the organization." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)

Some could be distinguished by their focus on economic concerns, others on scientific, martial, religious, or humanitarian ones. But all of them had a system of awarding, regulating, and seizing status and prestige and, in fact, that system is the engine that drives a society to concern itself with something or other beyond its mere survival... The assignment of status and prestige to one field or another will directly affect how much effort is put into it, and thus how much a society achieves in that field." - [Great Founder Theory, by Samo Burja](https://samoburja.com/gft/)




> "We are bad at allocating attention, both individually and collectively. For example, how much attention do you pay to your friends and family, or to the existential question of the meaning of your life? And how much attention are we paying as humanity to the great challenges and opportunities of our time, such as the climate crisis and space travel? Markets are not able to help us better allocate attention because prices do not, and cannot, exist for many of the issues that we should be paying attention to. Consider paying attention to finding your purpose in life: there is no supply and demand that will form a ‘purpose price’ for an individual; it’s ultimately up to you to allocate enough attention to this existential question." - [The World After Capital, by Albert Wenger](https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/readme#:~:text=We%20are%20bad,this%20existential%20question.)

If we all used bots to interact with Facebook and didn’t like how our newsfeed was prioritized, we could ask our friends to instruct their bots to send us status updates directly, so that we could form our own feeds.

The reason users don’t wield the same power on mobile is that native apps relegate end users to interacting with services using our eyes, ears, brain and fingers. We cannot use the computing capabilities of our smartphones, which are as powerful as supercomputers were until quite recently, in order to interact with the apps on our behalf. The apps control us, instead of us controlling the apps. Like a Web browser, a mobile user agent could do things such as block ads, keep copies of responses to services and let users participate in multiple services simultaneously.

Unfortunately, in the US there are three separate laws that make those steps illegal. The first is the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The second is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). And the third is the legal construction that by clicking ‘I accept’ on an End User License Agreement (EULA) or a set of Terms of Service (TOS), I am legally bound to respect whatever restrictions Facebook decides to impose.

> "It is a matter of power. If we compare the level of voter turn-out in different elections for different forms of political body, a clear pattern emerges. There is a direct link between power and turn-out: the more power is up for grabs, or, to put it another way, the more power is connected to the position or body to which people are being elected, the greater the level of voter interest. This means that the crisis of democracy has nothing to do with a loss of faith in active politicians per se, but is mainly to do with a growing concern about the increasing impotence of politicians. The silent protest of a growing number of couch potatoes is not directed towards politicians’ abuse of power, but towards their loss of power.
>
> This fact is, unfortunately, not particularly 'sexy’, and does not fit in with media dramaturgy; it does not provide any attention-grabbing headlines and it does not provide ammunition for a bout of populist mud slinging. And, above all, it does not serve the interests of the media. So, instead, we are supplied with a constant stream of propaganda telling us about the righteous contempt that the people feel for the corrupt political class, which only serves to weaken the position of politicians still further, which in turn leads to a new round of gauntlet running in the media. This process continues in a vicious circle, the inevitable culmination of which is the death of representative democracy, the complete impotence of politicians and a hyper-real media dictatorship. This process is strengthened by feedback. Through the use of opinion polls, whose questions are obviously phrased by the media to serve their own purposes, the population is told what it thinks and what it is ‘natural’ to think. Then the media go on to show how the adaptable politicians are adapting to this norm, or pretend to be adapting, and so the process goes on and on, ad infinitum. The investigations of the mass media are, on their most profound level, investigations into the mass media themselves. Statistics that purport to represent public opinion are actually the tools used by the media to manufacture opinion." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "Speed and the abolishment of distance hastened the materialization of information. The telegraph revolutionized the transport of information over long distances and, as a consequence, a great deal of contemporary attention was paid to transportation and speed, while other aspects - such as interpretation, context and comprehension - were neglected. A piece of quickly transported information came to be regarded as something valuable in itself, quite regardless of what it meant or could be used for. But the fact that technology solves one problem does not mean that all related problems disappear or become less pressing. Working out how to transport information over great distances does not mean that people know how to interpret and understand the information in a relevant context. What happens is simply that some things are left in the shade when the sun rises over a new paradigm. For every problem solved by a technology, at least one new problem usually appears." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

What we lack today is not information, but overview and context.

> "How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the elite in power within a democracy - the best-organized lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates - can effectively achieve the same result. Against any given collection of Tacts’, another instantly appears; against the report of any given piece of alarming scientific research, another more reassuring one appears. And so on. And afterwards everything gets back to business as usual. It looks like a vital democracy, but it is merely a spectacle for the masses. This torrent of information is thus no unforeseen phenomenon and certainly in no way a fortuitous lottery jackpot for the citizens and consumers, but is actually a conscious strategy for maintaining social control. Powerful interest groups send out murky clouds of distracting information in order to maintain the secrecy of certain essential knowledge. The overload of information and the lack of context are intimately linked, two aspects of the same subject." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

The frequent showers of contradictory information have one single coherent message: don’t trust your experiences and perceptions - listen to The Latest instead. But The Latest is quickly succeeded by The Very Latest, and it is practically impossible to imagine any information, any combination of new facts, that could affect the status quo to any noticeable degree: partly for practical reasons, because facts are so fickle and their rate of replacement so high, partly purely theoretically, because there is an absence of any context that is valid for the whole of the social collective, from which the implications of these facts could be determined.

> The public, consisting of engaged citizens with a common interest in and responsibility for the general good - the classic precondition of democracy - never materialized in reality. Instead, the ever more vocal mass of the population and the ever more ambitious middle class, which had so terrified the privileged elite of the nineteenth century, are being transformed under the relentlessly increasing pressure of information into a divided and ruler-friendly multitude of antagonistic special-interest groups. This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, in other words, all this torrent of new information that is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, ‘precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure’.

> "If the eighteenth century’s newspapers and pamphlets had reflected a genuine, revolutionary opinion that was critical of power, then the press during the nineteenth century was considerably more of an instrument of power with which the public was consciously manipulated and a general opinion manufactured. This means that it is still correct to regard the press, and information, as a weapon. But also that it is important to keep an eye on whose finger is on the trigger, and which interests this person represents. The capitalist elite, like every other, sought to maintain the status quo. The primary task of its propaganda was to protect social, economic and political privileges in an age when privileges were no longer the fashion and when increasing welfare and improved education were leading to demands for more rapid increases in equality. Those in power sought, quite consciously, with the help of the PR experts who were beginning to sharpen their tools by the beginning of the twentieth century, to turn the increase in welfare and the improvements in education to their own advantage and persuade the ambitious middle class of the advantages of entering into a tacit but nonetheless effective pact. The trick was to present the alternative - political change - as something extremely unpleasant. The message was that the newspaper-reading middle class risked losing its hard-won gilt-edged life if the existing order was disturbed: that chaos and mob rule threatened if the winds of change were set free. The trick worked. It was possible, it turned out, to manufacture opinion. PR methods were built on science - what else? The PR experts regarded themselves as scientists." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The electronic mass media offered even better opportunities to set people’s tongues in motion. The printed word still requires a certain level of education in order to be understood, whereas radio, for instance, requires nothing but the flick of a switch and adequate hearing. This gave propagandists of all descriptions an opportunity to get inside people’s homes in a way that was historically unique. Film, and eventually television, offered the opportunity to communicate directly through images. For someone looking at images, either moving or frozen, their perspective and the act of seeing are determined by the originator of the image. This opens what the critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin calls ‘the optics of the unconscious’: a shortcut for the camera to bypass the intellectual censorship that comes into effect when we have to adopt a position towards a message on the abstract level of words; a direct channel into the individual’s private dream factory where unexpressed desires and fears roam about. Anyone who can manage to stay awake will experience a stimulating massage of his or her irrational inner self.
>
> The theatrical presentation of democracy demanded steady direction if it was not to go off the rails: this was the main creed and business idea of the developing PR industry. Historical factors - welfare and education - made it necessary for the ruling and - naturally - responsible elite to develop a well-stocked toolbox of power so as to be prepared for all eventualities. General opinion was in constant need of tending and pruning - no undesirable weeds could be permitted to grow too tall. The masses could easily start to think a mass of foolish ideas. The medicine for this was information, but it must be administered by experts within the mass media and the world of social psychology. With the help of precise science it would be possible, in theory at least, to fine-tune the intellectual and emotional life of the masses.

> "This activity is carried out to an extent unimagined by the general population. One tangible example, taken from the sociologist Stuart Ewen, is how American opinion was programmed fundamentally and in good time for a potential military offensive against Iraq in the early 1990s. One congressional inquiry that gained a great deal of media attention involved a 15-year-old girl from Kuwait, a hospital volunteer who testified that she had witnessed with her own eyes how, after the invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi troops had entered the hospital in Kuwait City, dragged premature babies out of their incubators and left them to die on cold corridor floors. This grim act of barbarism outraged the USA. No one paid any heed to the fact that the girl in question remained anonymous, for the stated reason that her own safety was at risk. Only in retrospect, when the war was long over, did it emerge that the girl was actually Nayirah al-Sabah, daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the USA, and that she could not possibly have seen the things she testified to having seen. It also became apparent that her appearance before the inquiry had been arranged by one Gary Hymel, vice-MD of Hill & Knowlton, one of the largest PR companies in the world, which counted the Kuwaiti royal family among its wealthy clients. Nayirah’s testimony was part of a conscious and successful strategy and was one of a great number of manufactured media events, all designed to direct American fury at Baghdad." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Increased competition is not visible so much in the form of direct confrontations as it is in the division of every market into several smaller, ever more specialized sub-departments. Every player, both individuals and entire cultures, is forced to distil those qualities that are in demand by the particular niche of the market holding sway at that moment, to the detriment of general knowledge and overview. This leads to the development of an increasingly tightly connected, finely meshed network of mutual dependency.

The principle of transparency is that all the members of the network have access to all relevant information, and that at any time they wish they can make their own contribution to the internal debate. All cards are on the table, everyone can form their own opinion and make comments, everyone can participate in the decision-making process. If transparency is the dominant principle in informational society, this will entail a revolution in the labour market. When a traditional business is transformed into a transparent network, the employer can no longer treat employees according to feudal principles governing the exercise of power.

Each successful decision one way or another might lead to spectacular gains, while each unsuccessful decision about access or exclusion might have devastating consequences for the curators’, and therefore the network’s, reputation and credibility. It is reputation, or capital of trust, that is the network’s most important asset; with the help of reputation, attention is attracted to the networks, and there is a great shortage of attention, rather than money, on the net.

The curator will assume the state’s function as moral guardian and will punish all transgressions against netiquette by expelling the delinquent from attractive networks. Exclusion, restricted access to information and other forms of rescinded membership privileges are the netocracy’s methods for deterring and controlling dissidents. Severe limitations of virtual mobility will be the informational equivalent to internment. To protect their common interests and make the administration of the networks more effective, the curators will establish their powerful meta-networks for policy questions about net policing.

> "So much ideological capital has been invested in the idea of bourgeois democracy that every attempt to examine its propaganda critically and every discussion of possible faults in the democratic theory have been rejected with distaste and labelled as heresy by the immense forces guarding this myth. A cult has been constructed around democracy and its rituals: a cult with strikingly irrational elements, a mass movement whose cohesive idea is the notion that the magical power of the correct political procedure can solve, or at least ameliorate, all serious social problems. The forms of democracy themselves are believed to conjure up sound political content. The correct method of making decisions always results in wise decisions, according to this most potent of democracy’s dogmas. The self-appointed representatives of political goodness have persuaded themselves, and anyone who has cared to listen, that there is no difference between the correct method of making decisions and wise decisions, and whenever someone has the bad manners to point out that the Nazis, to take one striking example, came to power as a result of democracy and parliamentary elections, the response is always a series of diffuse explanations about the German population’s ‘democratic immaturity’, and the existence of that specific situation at that particular time. There is seldom or never a recognition that democracy itself is no guarantee for good and wise decision making.
>
> Every exception is turned around so that it confirms the general rule: as soon as the democratic maturity of the population has reached a certain acceptable level, democracy will automatically produce wise decisions like a well-oiled political machine. This faith in the process of democratic maturity of the population is as unshakeabie as it is unfounded. It is a matter of religious faith rather than empirical knowledge. According to the axiom, voters cannot vote wrongly, and if the people should nonetheless do so - like the Austrian people did when a populist rightwing party was elevated to government in the dying weeks of the twentieth century, a result which the rest of the European Union strongly opposed - then it is simply a matter of pronouncing loudly that a mistake has been made and bringing about a correction through suitable actions.
>
> This is all about the bourgeoisie’s parading democracy as if it in itself were something holy, yet being unable to accept democracy when it conflicts with the bourgeoisie’s own interests. There is a considerable amount of hypocrisy in the ceremonial rhetoric of democracy. What is at best a problematic and fragile compromise between conflicting political forces, and at worst a method of legitimizing the decisions that the elite wants to force through, is elevated as something good, eternal and beyond all doubt - something in accordance with the laws of nature. Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

> "The real traditional family is something entirely different: an economic union and socialization project that links various generations together. The nuclear family - which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another late-twentieth-century phenomenon, nuclear weapons - ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of late-capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital (once again in the same boat), that people develop into ‘independent individuals’ rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realization, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.
>
> The nuclear family arose because it was the smallest, most individualized social entity that was feasible once the necessary requirements of reproduction had been taken into consideration. But as far as the state, and capital, are concerned, it does not need to be stable at all. A single parent is more dependent upon subsidies than a couple, and is therefore more submissive and more easily controlled. A marked increase in the number of single-occupancy homes also means, naturally, that consumption increases dramatically. The ideal would be for everyone to live alone in their own home, with their own car, so that optimal demand for houses, cars, sofas, cookers, etc., could be achieved. The path of the isolated, independent individual towards self-realization always passes through increased consumption." - [Netocracy: The New Power Elite and Life After Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208996.Netocracy)

Similarly, if we ask ourselves what politics really is, the answer is that politics is merely a continuation of religion by other means. And it definitely not only applies to Bolshevism or to other more or less doctrinal and airy-fairy movements with distinct features of sectarianism.

This is what people do and devote their lives to. We are, as Haidt writes, no saints, but sometimes we are really good team players. “Religion is loyalty to the world”, as the forefather of syntheism Alfred North Whitehead puts it." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "We all constantly act like believers in our everyday lives... We are all laymen in all conceivable subject areas that lie outside our own professional fields. We have first-hand knowledge of extremely little of everything that lies at the core of our existence and our societies. Accordingly, we choose our authorities on more or less arbitrary grounds, and we then choose to believe in what they claim without being able to investigate the matter to any extent at all. Dennett uses the formula e=mc2 as an example. Do we believe in it? Many of us have heard about it, and many believe they know it to be accepted by a number of experts within physics, which makes it appear truthful and plausible. But few of us can actually explain in any detail why, because few of us can be said to understand the formula in any reasonable sense of the word “understand”. So how can we believe in something we do not understand?
>
> What we do, according to Dennett, is believe that anything asserted about the formula e=mc2 is actually true. But in truth we do not know. And for this reason, it is impossible to attain anything even resembling consensus on, for example, the issue of the climate crisis. What opinion the layman has about it depends largely on what authorities he chooses to believe in, which in turn is governed by his political positions on issues that pertain to economic growth and government regulation, among other things. We believe in what agrees with what we already believe in. We are religious...
>
> The new, rational human being, freed from superstition and systematic self-delusion by the sciences that are making heroic progress, is a completely unrealistic utopia without any foundation in what research actually tells us about how people really function. We are religious, whether we understand it or not. We believe, and believe that we know much more than we actually do know. And actually it really does not matter at all what content is proclaimed from pulpits or in scripture. The person who enters into a discussion about the apparent self-contradictions or absurdities in a religious doctrine is barking up the wrong tree. Some believe in God X, endowed with certain attributes and preferences, while others believe in something else, which is either called God or something else. What is important and interesting is whether, and in that case how, religion actually works. Trying to understand religion’s tenacity and fervour by studying various ideas of God is, writes Jonathan Haidt, like trying to understand the attraction of football games to their audience by studying how the ball moves on the pitch.
>
> Religion has developed through cultural evolution, just like all other social-collective phenomena. Today we can reject a number of features of the content of many religions – it would be strange if it were not so – but we can hardly deny that they have served certain purposes under certain historically determined sets of conditions; and nor can we reasonably deny that they have in fact served these purposes with considerable success; otherwise religions would have perished without leaving many traces. But they did not. Along with psychologists such as Haidt and anthropologists such as Scott Atran and Joe Henrich we argue that the main reason is that this cultural innovation increased the coherence within groups and made them cooperate better internally compared to other groups. This did not necessarily mean that the other groups were outcompeted, but rather that they allowed themselves to be absorbed by the more effective religions.
>
> The crucial point of having a god is that the god is said to reward loyalty and cooperation, while punishing selfishness and mendacity. An all-seeing god is particularly effective in such a context, since people cheat less when they feel that they are being watched. Common sacrifices and collective rites increase coherence, which creates the trust within the group that enables intimate and trusting cooperation outside the circle of family members. According to Haidt with support from Charles Darwin and the French sociologist Emile Durkheim, the main function of religion is that it produces groups whose coherence makes them function like organisms. The biologist David Sloan Wilson writes in his book Darwin’s Cathedral that religions primarily exist in order for it to be possible for people to accomplish together what they cannot accomplish on their own.
>
> This productive coherence exercises a powerful allure for reasons that we need not address further. We humans are social creatures who experience well-being by doing things together with others, and its contrast – alienation and isolation – is not something on which one can build dynamic and prosperous societies. This in turn means, as Haidt points out, that in the sense of being modern people, enlightened and rational, we can choose to reject organised religion, but even if we do so, we cannot emancipate ourselves just like that from the basic religious psychology that we are concerned with here. However, we can, as stated, always manipulate the terminology and imagine that religion is something other than religion, because we have decided to call it something else, if this makes us feel modern and clear-thinking.
>
> Thus we have actually answered our opening question. God does exist. At least and without a doubt in an ontological sense. We have ourselves created the idea, just as we have created the ideas of democracy and art and a host of others. Religion lives, even among those who believe they have left it. Everything is religion and everyone is a believer. Anyone claiming the opposite, is truly, literally speaking, blinded by their faith. The really interesting question which thereby opens up is what to do with God and religion in the Internet age, when all the basic assumptions of our lives and existence are changing. How can God and religion become relevant, credible and engaging concepts for us and for future generations? That is the question which Syntheism seeks to answer." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The term religion stems from Medieval French where it signified the strong and heartfelt sense of community that prevails within a collective, a group of people who make up a congregation through establishing this loyalty to each other. This French term in turn originates from the Latin re-ligare: to reconnect with somebody or something, to connect again with those who, for some reason or other, have lost contact with each other but who ought to, and/or want to, belong together. So if we follow this term back to its source, we find that in its original sense religion ought to be seen as a social practice, organised with the purpose of creating strong and enduring ties between people, an affinity that in some cases, but far from always, also includes affinity between people and a set of gods, a theism.
>
> According to the Austrian monk David Steindl-Rast, religious practice starts with doctrine, which is followed by ethics and finally consummated in ritual – all with the purpose of creating a social emergence, to unite people around an entity that they experience as greater than themselves individually, and greater than the sum of the group of individuals. This is definitely something worth bearing in mind: the original point of religion was to create affinity and loyalty within a dynamic collective. In this context, God is no more than the arbitrarily chosen name for the sense of belonging that people seek. Nowhere is this usage of God as a productive object of projection clearer than in the person who has failed in life in his or her own mind and is bravely struggling for self-restitution. When Bill Wilson founds Alcoholics Anonymous in the United States in the 1930s for example, it was with the unshakeable conviction that religion – in whichever form it appears, as long as it preaches a sense of belonging that is greater and mightier than the small, cramped prison, which is how the addict experiences his/her own subjectivity – is the best possible springboard out of alcohol addiction. Religion is that within us which is greater than ourselves and for precisely this reason it is closer to our hearts than our fragile little egos." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

And if we do not find any such patterns, we don’t hesitate to quite simply invent them. With a utopia on the horizon, we give our lives a direction and a context. God is another name for utopia, and utopia is another name for God.
>
> The productive and fruitful response to atheism is not to indifferently accept the death of God, but to instead realise that it was a mistake to place God in the past as the ageless progenitor of us and the cosmos. We have already killed the God of the past by producing and accumulating large quantities of knowledge with which this divinity is not compatible. God as a functional utopia is instead the name of what we dream of creating; God is Syntheos, the created rather than the creating God. God is not (any longer) dead, since (we have now realised that) God has never been born: God belongs to us because God belongs to the future, and we already live in the future. The French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux expresses the syntheist passion in the words: “God is too important a concept to be left in the hands of the religious.”" - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

The Internet is thereby transformed from a technological into a theological phenomenon. The Internet is the God of the new age, and furthermore extremely appropriate for an age characterised by an unlimited faith in the possibilities of creativity. Thus, the Internet is a god that even those who regard themselves as atheists can devote themselves to. Syntheologically, we express this state of affairs as that the Internet is a manifestation of Syntheos, the new god that we humans are creating rather than the old god which, according to our ancestors, is said to have created us once upon a time in a distant past." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "If there is anything we can say with certainty, it is that alienation in the new network society will increase dramatically. A growing alienation is the price we pay for every increase in the technological and social complexity that we are experiencing now and for years to come. With the Internet’s breakthrough, it is literally exploding. And there is only one functional weapon against alienation, namely its opposite: religion. Traditional religion’s mistake was to place the name of its longing for another world, God, in the past (theism, belief in a preordained God), when the logically correct and only reasonable manoeuvre of course is to place the object of all human longing, God, in the future (syntheism, the belief in a God that man himself creates).
>
> The atheism that denies longing – between theism and syntheism – has played out its role as the necessary antipole between thesis and synthesis. For in its lack of content, and as pure negation, atheism is completely meaningless as the goal of the dialectical process. This acute lack of essence explains why atheists have never succeeded in building any cathedrals or anything at all except vapid paper monuments to their own excellence. It is like a philosophical temperance movement: you meet and are sober together, totally oblivious of the ecstatic party that is going on somewhere else entirely. Classical atheism can only say what it is not, but not what it de facto is. This purely negative and in essence substance-less doctrine is quite simply a worthless weapon against alienation. It consoles no one and explains nothing." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Only through a new syntheistic meta-narrative, constructed on the utopian conviction that humanity’s only possible salvation is through its creation of Syntheos, can the ecological apocalypse be avoided. It is not possible to preserve human life on the planet with any amount of politics. For politics is subservient to the capitalist death drive – there is no chance of becoming a leading politician without first becoming dependent on the statist-corporativistic power structure – which does its utmost to grind on relentlessly with its ruthless plundering of resources until the planet is uninhabitable and lifeless.

The Western welfare state, which is based on precisely such institutionalised wishful thinking about strong and continuous growth, is looking more and more like a cynical pyramid scheme.

> "If history is viewed as a Hegelian dialectics, we see a clear pattern: monotheism is the thesis, individualism is the antithesis and syntheism is the synthesis. That syntheism is the synthesis in this dialectical process is a consequence of the fact that theism and atheism can never meet; they are fundamentally and definitionally incompatible. Syntheism should absolutely not be understood as a compromise between theism and atheism – in Hegelian dialectics, a synthesis is something considerably more sophisticated than just a banal coalescence of thesis and antithesis – rather, it is a necessary continuation of theism’s and atheism’s combined dichotomy, the only possible way out of the paralysing deadlock that arises when theism and atheism are pitted against each other. As the logical synthesis of this pair of opposites (theism versus atheism), syntheism offers a possibility for the atheist to go further and uncompromisingly deepen atheism...
>
> Only through perfecting the individualist paradigm can mankind grasp its terrible consequences, and then, and only then, the door to the syntheist possibility swings open... Atheism robs the human being of her access to the holy and the divine by first sharing theism’s conviction that the holy and the divine must be synonymous with the transcendental, and then murdering the transcendental and thus reducing the human being to a cold and indifferent immanence, which is axiomatic for atheism. What syntheism does is that it picks up mankind in precisely the immanence where atheism has abandoned him and makes him apprehend the immanent as the truly holy and divine without any nostalgic longing for transcendentalism at all.

> "German philosopher Jürgen Habermas launches intersubjectivity as the highest truth that humans can aspire to after Kant has shifted objective reality to where it is hopelessly out of reach. According to Habermas, the absence of this objectivity can only be confronted and militated against by an extensive plurality of subjective voices. Habermas imagines that intersubjectivity is negotiated between actors on an equal footing in the public sphere, which is both laborious and time-consuming, but which in the end nonetheless yields a satisfactory result, due to lots of subjective positions confronting and interacting with each other. To take one example, the credibility of science is based on the conviction that intersubjective truth can be fished out through the process referred to as peer review.

> "If religion happens to be the answer, which it apparently has been in every type of society that we know of throughout all of human history up until today – what then is the question? What is it that makes the religious memeplex in particular so attractive and successful in the cultural evolutionary process?
>
> To start with, we cannot help but note that the human brain has been shaped by natural selection to eagerly welcome religious memes and become a believer brain. Being part of the religious community is thus something that in one way or another feels satisfying for the individual member of the congregation, while the religious collective gains competitive advantages in relation to other groups because of their special form of cohesion and mutual understanding which creates trust, impetus and efficiency to an extent that is hard to top. Moreover, at least in the transition from the nomadic existence of hunters and gatherers to a settled agricultural one, religious memes are blessed with dedicated propagandists and watchdogs, who regard it as their mission in life to spread these memes in particular further, and to protect them from dangerous competitors in the struggle for survival.
>
> So what is it then that religion has to offer and that makes up for the small and big sacrifices that have always been connected with the practice of religion?...
>
> But the crass and simple answer to the question of what value religion – or what we call religion today – had and still has to offer its practitioners, is survival. Man is a flock animal and can only cope with the hard struggle for survival to the extent that he can create well-functioning groups. A lone individual is easy prey on the savannah. In order to achieve a well-functioning group, at least two things are required: effective communication, and mutual trust which functions best when in it based on common values. And it is precisely that you share the values and feelings of the collective which the devoted practice of religion signals to the world around you. You show that you can be trusted, that your loyalties are the right ones, and that you are a worthy member of the community. Therefore, there are also invariably costs involved in the practice of religion: through paying what it costs to demonstrate your commitment and loyalty to the continued existence of the group you signal that you are prepared to set aside self-interest. A religion, argues the anthropologist William Irons, is basically a control system where the loyalty and devotion of the members of the congregation is monitored by examining the zeal with which they carry out the mandated and preferably also costly rituals.
>
> In this way, you lay the foundation for the necessary trust within the group, and also lay the foundation for the body of regulations that has the task of governing the actions of its individual members, which in turn creates order and security within the system. Accordingly, the selfish deviant is provided with strong incentives to align herself with the group and subordinate herself to its values and set of beliefs. Or at least act as if subservience were the obvious choice. The alternative would be ostracisation or some other powerful sanction. And considering that our hunting and gathering forefathers in principle were constantly at war with other groups of species kinsfolk, who constituted their determined and dangerous competitors in the daily struggle for crucial resources, the cohesion of the collective has always been of the greatest importance. With time Man develops such an intense dependence on the chemicals serotonin and oxytocin, which are released in a torrential stream right at the point when feelings of belonging to the collective are felt, that this dependence in itself appears to be an equally strong foundation for Man’s special status as language or consciousness are.
>
> Warfare necessitates collaboration, in both people and ants, as the science journalist Nicholas Wade observes in his perceptive book The Faith Instinct. For both these species, it is necessary to be able to reliably identify group membership. The ants handle this exclusively with the aid of chemical signals and therefore, in contrast to humans, have no need for religious symbolism. In this context and from this point of view, the fear of the wrath of all-seeing divinities is a good thing: it increases the precision of the signalling system. People believe that selfish behaviour is punished and therefore submit to the given rules. The stronger this fear, the stronger the fabric that binds the society together will be. And the stronger this fabric, the more powerfully the chemical-hormonal reward system that the human being partly shares with the ant will be strengthened. This explains why soldiers who return from the most brutal conflicts often long to be back on the battlefield so intensely that they find it completely impossible to adapt to the peaceful environment at home. They quite simply lack the intense fellowship in the trenches and the chemical-hormonal rewards this sense of belonging is associated with – an experience whose strength only war and religion have succeeded in matching throughout history. With this fact in mind, it is not particularly easy for pacifist atheists to find satisfaction in life.

> Islam originally means precisely submission and every faithful Muslim submits to a strictly circumscribed way of life filled with more or less arduous duties in the form of daily prayers, fasts, pilgrimages, etc. The believer thus becomes a small but significant cog in an infinitely much greater machinery. In key respects, religion is precisely this: a liberation from the petty perspective of one’s own ego and the limited possibilities for asserting oneself in the world, which leads to a merging into a collective organism with everything that this means in terms of the feelings of expansion and ecstasy associated with coordinated behaviour, that is, participation in a socio-cultural emergence process. Singing, dancing, speaking in tongues: through various types of liturgical rites, religion binds the collective together emotionally and creates at least one convincing illusion of access to the transcendental. Personal antipathies and conflicts are lessened or disappear in the rhythmically synchronised intoxication of the community." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "Everything is religion, but everything is also politics. And politics is religion, and religion is to a high degree politics. Without utopias there are no visions, and without visions there is no collective and organised hope of a better life in a society that has undergone desirable changes. In a society without utopias, cynical isolationism reigns supreme in the public arena. For this reason, such a society is the most dangerous society of all. Each and every person at the most cares about herself and her loved ones, but displays a programmatic disinterest in how everyone else fares. This lack of social cohesion sooner or later leads to societal collapse within all key areas. The opposite of utopia is, as we know, dystopia. The approaching ecological apocalypse has emerged as our time’s great and dominant dystopia. The fateful question that will be decisive for the 21st century is how the approaching ecological apocalypse is to be prevented or at least tackled in order to ameliorate or postpone it if possible.
>
> We thus live in an age that lacks a credible utopia, but that at the same time is coloured by a doomsday narrative that is every bit as powerful as it is threatening in the political discourse. Environmental issues are constantly on the agenda, as is the collective guilty conscience because these issues are constantly being down-prioritised by politicians who instead give priority to short-term measures on hip-pocket issues, measures that might perhaps yield the odd job opportunity but that also damage or preclude the necessary improvements in the environment. The growing plurarchy in a society where everyone talks at cross purposes, and increasingly vociferously focuses on pseudo-issues, evokes a paralysing state of hypercynicism (see The Netocrats). At the same time it is at precisely chaotic points in history of this type that new metaphysical systems are established – with Pauline Christianity in the crumbling Roman Empire and Kantian individualism in conjunction with the French Revolution as two very clear examples – and there is no reason to believe that our age should be any different in this respect.
>
> The hypercynical state is namely due to the fact that the prevailing ideological paradigm is no longer in step with its surrounding material reality. Rather, the lack of utopianism and the abundance of dystopianism is the final proof of the prevailing paradigm having reached the end of the road and lost all remaining remnants of relevance." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is hardly a coincidence that these two movements are arising in the same places in the world – namely in Northern Europe and along the coasts of North American – since it is in these places that the expansion of the Internet is most powerful, psychedelic experimentation most extensive, and thus the insight into the planet’s vulnerability is being disseminated most rapidly and is gaining first a foothold. These two movements are, quite simply, two sides of the same metaphysical coin, and it is syntheism that is the coin itself." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

> "The key issue when we are talking about a free and open Internet is of course how much transparency a society should and can handle. It is then important to understand that the problem with transparency is never the transparency itself – to confess, to lay bare one’s heart of hearts for one’s fellow sisters and brothers in the community, is also a holy act within syntheism – but how it affects the network pyramid in question, that is, who lays himself bare for whom and thereby risks, at least in the short-term, a possible loss of power first? Does the current transparentisation strengthen the top, middle or bottom of the prevailing power structure in the society? Is the power structure levelled out in the direction of the syntheist utopia’s radical equality, or is the prevailing power structure reinforced in such a way that social inequality is preserved?
>
> We seek the answers to these questions for example in the French philosopher Michael Foucault’s pragmatist ethics: If the transparentisation begins from the top down – that is, if it is the rulers who have all of their secrets exposed first – it can be implemented painlessly throughout the entire power structure from the top and all the way down. On the other hand, if the transparentisation begins from the bottom up, the consequence will no doubt be a capitalist police state, and thereby – apart from all the other misery that such a development would entail – the ecological apocalypse would soon be unavoidable. It is the citizens who must first know everything about the activities of the nation state and the major corporations rather than the statist-corporatist establishment being allowed to bug and register the citizens’ opinions and preferences.
>
> Therefore, according to syntheism the battle of WikiLeaks and other whistle-blower organisations to disclose cover-ups of the activities of people in power is a sacred project, while conversely the attempts of the nation states and the major corporations to bug and register the views of citizens represent a flagrant violation of universal, human rights. Transparentisation in an increasingly transparent society must quite simply spread from the top down by being switched on from the bottom up. The order must be the following: first the person in power bares himself, then the citizen bares herself. And it is precisely here that the antagonism between the new syntheist netocracy and the old statist-corporatist power structure becomes most apparent. The netocracy regards the Internet as a relationalist phenomenon: to be a netocrat is to identify with the network itself, to act as the Internet’s agent. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, regard the Internet as a correlationist object, alien to and hostile towards the individualist subject and therefore a troubling object that must be tamed and controlled, by force if necessary." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

Accordingly, the fight for the free and open Internet is the answer to what must be done; it is the engine that drives the new utopia rather than the brake that hinders the old dystopia. What we are talking about here is far more than just parallel phenomena in the market for the shaping public opinion: syntheism is de facto the name of the digital integrity movement’s underlying metaphysics. This explains why the fight for the free and open Internet is the central political struggle in the 21st century. All other important political conflicts that play out during, and contribute to giving colour to, informationalism’s growth, are completely dependent on how this conflict unfolds. It concerns far more than the growing netocracy’s striving to ignore the ruling bourgeoisie, which has controlled the world since the paradigm of the printing press gained broad acceptance. Beyond the fight for the free and open Internet, the approaching ecological apocalypse is rearing its ugly head: a potential catastrophe that capitalism is responsible for and at the same time evidently lacks the ability to prevent." - [Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age, by Alexander Bard & Jan Soderqvist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24583533-syntheism---creating-god-in-the-internet-age)

It is difficult to think of a clearer illustration of how the democratic system de facto has collapsed under late capitalism and has now definitively morphed into a chaotic plurarchy. If an intelligence agency can grab the power from elected representatives, the word democracy loses all meaning. This is no longer about a democracy but about a massive, paranoid bureaucracy that does not need to take into account at all any form of democratic or even judicial influence over how certain State agencies operate. Late capitalism’s obsession with security, which is constantly mistaken for safety, could hardly have been exposed any more clearly.

This applies not least to the country that, more than any other, has acted as the emblem of liberal democracy, the USA. This once proud defender of universal freedom – in pace with an increasing number of hysterical narratives of fabricated external threats having been put forward – has been reduced to a lobby-controlled plurarchy in the hands of religious extremists and intelligence bureaucrats that operate in secret, backed up by interests that represent an enormous and thus depleting drain on resources (such as the NSA). It has gone so far that it is no longer the dream of individual freedom that is the engine in the American identity, but instead the collective paranoia.

Therefore new laws are constantly being produced, new crime classifications, new pathologies, new defects, new failures to rectify, new problems to investigate, which one can later expand on even further, rather than rectify them. Postmodern society offers no catharsis and lacks a narrative of how the capitalist tragedy is to be brought to an end. Capitalism quite simply lacks an exit strategy. Liberal democracy’s dilemma is not primarily that it is based on obsolete individualism – liberalism is individualism’s political ideology par excellence – but rather that it is based on the myth of the invisible hand’s mystical self-regulation. But such a hand does not exist, an unregulated market always moves towards sundry variants of corrupt monopolies or oligopolies as their terminuses. The invisible hand cannot do anything itself to stop this; that can only be done by visible hands. Pragmatism defeats liberalism every day of the week in actual politics.

Such a question of course assumes that we are intimately acquainted with some kind of god who does not exist anyway nor has ever existed, and beforehand at that. The correctly posed syntheological question is instead which god might come to exist, and the answer to this question is always synonymous with the core of the vision that is driving the paradigm in question. The syntheological response runs as follows: Tell me your utopia, and I will tell you what god you are seeking and following.

To solve the temporal credit assignment problem, brains must reinforce behaviors based on changes in predicted future rewards, not actual rewards.

Indeed, it makes sense that dopamine was the neuromodulator that evolution reshaped into a temporal difference learning signal, as the signal for nearby rewards it was the closest thing to a measure of predicted future reward. And so, dopamine was transformed from a good-things-are-nearby signal to a there-is-a-35 percent-chance-of-something-awesome-happening-in-exactly-ten-seconds signal.

Gambling and social feeds work by hacking into our five-hundred-million-year-old preference for surprise, producing a maladaptive edge case that evolution has not had time to account for. Curiosity and reinforcement learning coevolved because curiosity is a requirement for reinforcement learning to work. With the newfound ability to recognize patterns, remember places, and flexibly change behavior based on past rewards and punishments, the first vertebrates were presented with a new opportunity: for the first time, learning became, in and of itself, an extremely valuable activity. The more patterns a vertebrate recognized and the more places she remembered, the better she would survive. And the more new things she tried, the more likely she was to learn the correct contingencies between her actions and their corresponding outcomes.

Just as genes persist by hopping from parent cell to offspring cell, ideas persist by hopping from brain to brain, from generation to generation.

The fact that science could dependably produce reliable knowledge—in the form of theories or models that accurately predict the lawful or probabilistic behavior of the world—told Popper that science uses some kind of formal method to solve problems, unlike guessing or relying on gut instinct.

A functional equivalence between the mechanisms driving evolution, learning, and science suggests that adaptation and scientific knowledge are actually the same thing. Biological adaptation represents knowledge of the environment, and the knowledge we acquire through learning and science reflects adaptation to the environment. If you think about it, there really is no meaningful distinction between adaptive information and scientific knowledge—both allow life to predict an uncertain world, control matter, constrain chaos, and construct order from disorder.

> "Realizing that only a conscious entity has the ability to doubt inspired Descartes to make the simple but powerful statement “Cogito, ergo sum,” which roughly translates to “I think, therefore I am.” In other words, the fact that I am having an experience right now means that I—as a conscious observer—must really exist." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "As we’ve established, even the simplest organisms have a primitive form of cognition, which allows them to sense and respond to the surroundings, but we should not mistake agency for consciousness. Agency only requires that a system have a world model—an internally embedded statistical mapping that represents the biologically relevant regularities in the environment. But the mere presence of a world model doesn’t mean that the contents of the model are being experienced by an observer. Subjective experience is always witnessed by a “self,” which forms the seat of a first-person perspective. So, it seems that progress in solving the hard problem of consciousness can be made by identifying the mechanism that brings about an observer with a point of view. What, then, is the source of the self?
>
> According to the cognitive philosopher Douglas Hofstadter, for a point of view to emerge, the agent’s world model must model itself. We call this example of self-reference self-modeling, and for reasons that will soon be explained, it is an ability that would seem to require a brain. If Hofstadter’s model of minds as models with self-models is correct—which he described in qualitative detail in his 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop—we finally have a relatively precise answer for when consciousness comes into the picture as a result of cosmic evolution. Mind, in the full sense of the word, emerges with brain. Self-modeling as the source of self might sound too obvious, but sometimes the answers to problems that appear difficult are staring us in the face.
>
> Want proof that you are an observer with a model of the world and of yourself inside your head? Let’s do the exercise we did in Chapter Six. Close your eyes and try to envision yourself in a room. Zoom out to see your house and your neighborhood from a bird’s-eye view. Zoom out and see the planet Earth from space. Now imagine a friend sitting next to you in your room. You have not only modeled the world in your brain, you have modeled other modelers, and those familiar agents come to life in your dreams, complete with personalities and trademark quirks!
>
> These models of other minds were built up from accumulated experience with those people. While we are all unique individuals, we are also in many ways the sum total of all the minds we have modeled, and without knowing we consult with these other minds when making difficult decisions. For example, you may call on a famous musician you admire when writing a melody for a song, and you may call on a role model when trying to make a decision about your future, like a parent or an influential teacher you once had, without any real conscious thought or reflection.
>
> These agents need not be real agents that we’ve encountered in reality either. The popular saying “What would Jesus do?” reveals that Christians who ask this question have modeled their deity and look to that model for advice, support, and existential insight. The same goes for every other religion, and when we realize this, we see why there can be practical benefits to modeling abstract entities that have useful characteristics or properties. This general process has been called “thinking through other minds” by the same researchers who have applied the Bayesian brain hypothesis/free-energy principle to high-level hierarchical systems beyond brains, like ecosystems and societies.
>
> Friston and colleagues Maxwell Ramstead, director of research at the Spatial Web Foundation in California, and cognitive scientist Samuel Veissière at McGill University in Montreal have argued that the process of inferring other agents’ beliefs and expectations about the world informs us on how to behave in social situations and brings stability to society by coordinating collective behavior.
>
> Now imagine yourself in your room, and try to stare at yourself from above. How do you look? This is proof that you’ve modeled yourself as well. Pretty loopy, right? Now ask yourself, how accurate is your model of you?" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Hofstadter believes that the self, the I, the conscious observer, has true causal power on the world. He also gives us a vague but powerful insight into how this observer capable of causation comes into existence. By his account, the self emerges from self-reference “via a kind of vortex whereby patterns in a brain mirror the brain’s mirroring of the world, and eventually mirror themselves, whereupon the vortex of ‘I’ becomes a real, causal entity.”" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Details aside, the brain generates conscious experience when coordinated global activity emerges from the local electrical interactions of billions of neurons—the synchronous firing of those neurons integrates information from multiple processing streams into a single field of experience. It is not that synchronous firing of any kind produces conscious states, as we also see long-range synchronies with epilepsy. So, it is more careful to say that coordinated global firing at a particular synchrony (thought to be ~40 Hz) is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness. This global activity is made possible by a phenomenon we are now quite familiar with, thanks to cybernetics: feedback. Feedback loops running from the thalamus to the cortex—so-called thalamo-cortical loops—integrate information and bind features into a cohesive perceptual landscape.
>
> When does consciousness disappear? When the feedback loops disappear, because it is these loops that entrain the activity of the component parts, bringing about the global integration of information. Whenever there is feedback, there is some form of self-reference at play, and in brains, it can be a signature of self-modeling. Without feedback, the brain still functions as a physiological organ controlling autonomic functions, but consciousness fades into nonexistence. We know the mental model is still encoded in the neuronal architecture of the brain, but what disappears is the observer, the self, which comes from the self-reference we get from real-time self-modeling. When the strange loop is disrupted—the multilevel feedback loop that mirrors itself—consciousness fades. So, the mind should no longer be thought of as a nonphysical entity moving things around; it is a multilevel cybernetic controller with causal power over itself and its environment." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Global neuronal workspace theory proposes a computational model for how separate processing streams are integrated into a unified conscious perception through emergent synchronous activity that produces a “global workspace.” If the global workspace is the mental workspace that we call the conscious mind, how exactly is that workspace created?
>
> We can answer that question by recognizing that the workspace corresponds to a neural attractor, and loops are obviously involved in the formation and maintenance of any attractor. It is specifically fronto-parietal loops that create the global workspace—or loops between functionally connected regions in the frontal lobes and the parietal lobes. When the activity of neurons in these areas become coordinated past a certain critical threshold, waves of global order propagate through the network, synchronous brain-wide firing occurs, and a global attractor of persistent electrical activity emerges from a phase transition that Dehaene calls an “ignition event.”
>
> This phase transition in the brain broadcasts the information in the global workspace to other neural modules that typically process information separately, leading to what Daniel Dennett calls “fame in the brain.” Now the information in the conscious representation is available for all kinds of additional processing not possible without the global workspace. Specifically, information in the workspace becomes the focus of selective attention, and its contents can be manipulated by working memory, or it can be used to make high-level decisions that the brain has no stored solution for. Planning and imagination are also made possible by the global workspace, which momentarily subsumes those independently working systems into the neural attractor, allowing minds to do things that can’t be done without consciousness, like running mental simulations of possible futures in order to select the one that is most desirable. Why should we think the global workspace has something to do with self-modeling? Because, again, we see feedback loops, and when the loops disappear, so does the mental workspace. Conscious processing of globally available information is disrupted and higher-level cognition dissipates.
>
> So, the neuroscience suggests that Hofstadter is right. It is the causal loops running across levels that create consciousness, what neuroscientist Anil Seth characterizes as a “controlled hallucination,” which is a step up from “illusion,” as Dennett described it in his landmark 1991 book Consciousness Explained." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "A sentient system must have a cohesive model of the world, built up through interaction with it, and that world model must include a model of the system doing the modeling." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "In this way, the continuation of cosmic evolution toward higher complexity and greater knowledge crucially depends on intelligent agents that can and will exercise free will. It is the power to simulate counterfactuals, or “what if” scenarios, that will illuminate the causal path that is consistent with the continued persistence of life in the cosmos. By using our conscious mind to imagine the future implied by an open-ended evolutionary process, we can see that intelligence-aided recursive self-organization will continually add new levels to the growing hierarchy of life and mind, making metasystems of increasing computational complexity, causal power, and self-referential richness. That gives us a duty to fulfill as sentient citizens of the cosmos.
>
> In the model of reality proposed by poetic meta-naturalism, there is room for destiny and free will. Because the future is not determined in the strict sense imagined by Laplace, there is no paradox. As individuals, we are truly free to choose our future path, but because it is in our nature to try and survive, our actions are not random; they are directed toward a goal, a goal that we all share as living agents. This shared goal—evading equilibrium—harmonizes our collective activity, and because human civilization learns from its mistakes, progress becomes inevitable.
>
> Since cosmic evolution inexorably generates increasingly robust and powerful multilevel cybernetic control systems, the emergence and outward expansion of intelligence in the cosmos was predestined, but in a completely natural sense of the word, as Christian de Duve, Freeman Dyson, Harold Morowitz, Ray Kurzweil, Christof Koch, and other renaissance men of science have argued. The freedom is at the level of the agent who exercises conscious causal control, not the aggregate behavior of humanity, which settles into increasingly stable and integrated attractors as knowledge accumulates in cultural memory." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "If we are to take the idea of multiple realizability (substrate independence) seriously, then minds can be realized on different mediums and on different scales, as long as the relevant causal and computational mechanisms are duplicated in brain-like hardware. If this is true, we must entertain the idea that an information-processing system like the internet, which in this definition includes the humans it connects, can possess conscious states similar to those generated by a biological nervous system. As long as information is being integrated by feedback loops that generate models of the world and the self—in this case, the “self” being the system that is the global brain—mind will presumably emerge." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Cosmic teleology is a worldview that recognizes the goal-directed nature of our universe, a dynamical system that is becoming increasingly complex and sentient as time moves forward and natural processes play out. The cosmic teleology presented in this book is an entirely natural teleology—specifically an evolutionary-computational teleology that is fully compatible with the laws of physics—and a scientifically rigorous theory, as it can be described in quantitative terms and makes testable predictions.
>
> Because in the past the word “teleology” has sometimes been associated with a religious belief in a supernatural or mystical force that guides evolution toward progress, the label will undoubtedly bother some skeptics and atheists who have an aversion to religion. But this should not deter us from using the most appropriate and recognizable terminology. It is worth reiterating that the cosmic self-organization process being described here is entirely mechanistic—a sort of “blind groping” toward an increasingly complex state, driven by the universe’s proclivity to process information and accumulate knowledge in the architecture of adaptive complexity. It is not guided by any external force or metaphysical entity; functional organization is internally generated from the physical laws and the evolutionary dynamics that emerge from the constraints those laws impose on matter in motion." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "A modern cosmic teleology—a computational or Darwinian teleology—eliminates all “explanatory gaps” in the evolutionary story, shattering the creationist’s claim of “irreducible complexity,” and in turn putting the nail in the coffin for any “intelligent design” theories that invoke the supernatural to explain life’s origin. But reducing the teleological development of the cosmos to a series of natural mechanisms does not explain away the mystery of why we find ourselves in a self-organizing world that becomes increasingly self-aware and computationally powerful through a series of inevitable emergences. We no longer have “irreducible complexity” in the creationist’s sense, but we have irreducible emergent phenomena like life and consciousness, which can’t be explained away reductively—that is, in terms of atoms following fixed trajectories—without losing something critical in the explanation." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "We have a responsibility to do what is good for the living network, which includes not only humans but all sentient life, as well as the biosphere, since life critically depends on entire ecosystems for survival. If we care about the futures of our children, and their children, such a task is a moral obligation. If we want to see a universe that isn’t cold and lifeless, but increasingly sentient and creative, then it is also a spiritual obligation.
>
> Many assume that when you get down to the nuts and bolts of nature, a spiritual worldview is simply incompatible with a scientific one. While that is the common assumption, it couldn’t be more wrong. Spirituality simply refers to a sense of connection to something larger than oneself, and it has nothing to do with the supernatural. To quote Carl Sagan again, “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.”9 Einstein not only shared this view but also believed that the only path to true spiritual enlightenment was the trail we travel along when we pursue scientific discovery. “The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.”10" - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "“Religion” is another a loaded term, but a spiritual ideology that is guided by science and aided by technology, that has a universal morality and a shared existential goal, will be the worldview of the future. It has to be if we want our civilization to survive. Under the cosmic perspective, there is no “us versus them,” there’s only “we.” Since we’re all part of an interdependent whole, our goal should be to try to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people." - [The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity, by Bobby Azarian](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59093393)

> "Knowledge is enlightenment, knowledge is transcendence, and knowledge is power. The tendency toward disorder described by the second law requires that life acquire knowledge forever, giving us all an individual and collective purpose by creating the constraint that forces us to create.

> "All progress, both theoretical and practical, has resulted from a single human activity: the quest for what I call good explanations. Though this quest is uniquely human, its effectiveness is also a fundamental fact about reality at the most impersonal, cosmic level – namely that it conforms to universal laws of nature that are indeed good explanations.

If elites choose to dig in, they are likely to resort to repression. To avoid these extreme outcomes, both elites and the public have to change. Elites will have to cede authority and permit more local variation and experimentation. The public will have to be more tolerant. Imperfections and bad outcomes should not be taken as proof of conspiracy or evil intent. We should pay less heed to those who only can pour out condemnation and blame.

Famous landmarks of the old regime, like the daily newspaper and the political party, have begun to disintegrate under the pressure of this slow-motion collision. Many features we prized about the old world are also threatened: for example, liberal democracy and economic stability. Some of them will emerge permanently distorted by the stress.

Hierarchy has ruled the world since the human race attained meaningful numbers. The industrial mind just made it bigger, steeper, and more efficient. From the era of Rameses to that of Hosni Mubarak, it has exhibited predictable patterns of behavior: top-down, centralizing, painfully deliberate in action, process- obsessed, mesmerized by grand strategies and five-year plans, respectful of rank and order but contemptuous of the outsider, the amateur.

Nothing within the bounds of human nature could be less like a hierarchy. Where the latter is slow and plodding, networked action is lightning quick but unsteady in purpose. Where hierarchy has evolved a hard exoskeleton to keep every part in place, the network is loose and pliable—it can swell into millions or dissipate in an instant.

A significant fraction of the public must find the status quo acceptable, and the larger the number of true believers, the more solid the foundation underneath a regime.

Most significantly, the regime in its blindness fails to adjust its story of legitimacy to make it plausible in a crowded, fiercely competitive environment.

This is how H. informaticus experiences the changed environment: as an Amazonian flood of irreverent, controversy-ridden, anti-authority content, including direct criticism of the regime.
>
> The consequences are predictable and irreversible. The regime accumulates pain points: police brutality, economic mismanagement, foreign policy failures, botched responses to disasters. These problems can no longer be concealed or explained away. Instead, they are seized on by the newly-empowered public, and placed front-and-center in open discussions. In essence, government failure now sets the agenda.

> As the regime’s story of legitimacy becomes less and less persuasive, Homo informaticus adjusts his story of the world in opposition to that of the regime. He joins the ranks of similarly disaffected members of the public, who are hostile to the status quo, eager to pick fights with authority, and seek the means to broadcast their opinions and turn the tables on their rulers.
>
> The means of communication are of course provided by the information sphere. The unit of broadcasting can be a single individual—a Hoder, a Wael Ghonim, any member of the public, including Homo informaticus. The level of reach is billions, distributed across the face of the world. 
>
> At this stage, the public, clustered around networked communities of interest, has effectively taken control of the means of communication. Vital communities revolve around favorite themes and channels, which in the aggregate reveal the true tastes of the public, as opposed to what mass media, corporations, or governments wish the public to be interested in.
>
> Under authoritarian governments, vital communities will tend to coalesce in political opposition as they bump into regime surveillance and control. The regime still controls the apparatus of repression. It can deny service, physically attack, imprison, or even kill H. informaticus—but it can’t silence his message, because this message is constantly amplified and propagated by the opposition community. Since the opposition commands the means of communication and is embedded in the global information sphere, its voice carries beyond the reach of any national government.

> This was the situation in Egypt before the uprising of January 25, 2011. This is the situation in China today. The wealth and brute strength of the modern state are counterbalanced by the vast communicative powers of the public. Filters are placed on web access, police agents monitor suspect websites, foreign newscasters are blocked, domestic bloggers are harassed and thrown in jail—but every incident which tears away at the legitimacy of the regime is seized on by a rebellious public, and is then broadcast and magnified until criticism goes viral.

> The tug of war pits hierarchy against network, power against persuasion, government against the governed: under such conditions of alienation, every inch of political space is contested, and turbulence becomes a permanent feature of political life.

> Objective conditions and the nature of the political system must be accounted for, when it comes to the evolutionary process I have just described. The viciousness of the regime matters. It was safer to protest against Ben Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt than against Qaddafi in Libya or Assad in Syria— or, for that matter, the Kim dynasty in North Korea.
>
> But the rise of Homo informaticus places governments on a razor’s edge, where any mistake, any untoward event, can draw a networked public into the streets, calling for blood. This is the situation today for authoritarian governments and liberal democracies alike. The crisis in the world that I seek to depict concerns loss of trust in government, writ large. The mass extinction of stories of legitimacy leaves no margin for error, no residual store of public good will. Any spark can blow up any political system at any time, anywhere.

> I began by posing a question about how something as abstract as information can influence something as real as political power. Let me end the chapter by proposing an answer, in the form of three claims or hypotheses.

> 1. Information influences politics because it is indigestible by a government’s justifying story.
>
> 2. The greater the diffusion of information to the public, the more illegitimate any political status quo will appear.

> "Propaganda was the totalitarian’s admission that his power wasn’t total. Unlike democratic politicians, leaders of mass movements lacked feedback mechanisms: they had no idea what the masses were thinking, and could only hope to inject the desired opinions directly into the brains of their followers." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "My story—I repeat—concerns the tectonic collision between a public which will not rule and institutions of authority progressively less able to do so. My misgiving is that democracy will be ground to pieces under the stress. An immense psychological distance separates the two sides, even as they come together in conflict. This gulf is filled with dark matter: distrust. The elites who control the institutions have never really trusted the public, which they considered animalistic and prone to bouts of destructiveness. In effect, they sought to neuter the public by herding it into a mass and attaching it to established hierarchies. A glimpse at any American airport today will confirm that this horror of the top for the bottom has, if anything, grown more intense. What has changed, then, is the public’s distrust for authority—and its increased power, in the age of the Fifth Wave, to translate that distrust into action." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Modern governments can keep an eye on a thousand moving parts, but they can’t predict discontinuity. They can’t comprehend phase change. When the crisis arrives, they are slow to grasp its dimensions. When the effects become palpable, they reflexively reach for the crude tools they have at their disposal, whether or not these will improve the situation. In essence, governments can throw money at unwanted change, or they can hurl bombs and policemen." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Like money and marriage, legitimacy exists objectively because vast numbers of the public agree, subjectively, that it does exist. If enough people change their minds, the authorizing magic is lost." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Authority, as I use the term, flows from legitimacy, derived from monopoly. To some indeterminate degree, the public must trust and heed authority, or it is no authority at all. An important social function of authority is to deliver certainty in an uncertain world. It explains reality in the context of the shared story of the group. For this it must rely on persuasion rather than compulsion, since naked force is a destroyer of trust and faith. The need to persuade in turn explains the institutional propensity for visible symbols of authority—the patrician’s toga, the doctor’s white frock, the financier’s Armani suit. Authority being an intangible quality, those who wield it wish to be recognized for what they are. And they have been, historically, the only actors in the social drama, with the public relegated to the audience, able only to weep or applaud. Authority is an expansion of author, which originally meant something like “initiator”—the active human element in an otherwise inert population. Current structures of authority are a legacy of the industrial age. The public, when it needs answers, turns to institutions rather than to charismatic individuals. These institutions have been subjected to a Taylorist process of rationalization: they are, without exception, top-down, specialized, professionalized, prone to pseudo-scientific rituals and jargon. To enter such a precinct of authority requires a long and costly accreditation process—years of academic education and apprenticeship. Many are called, few are chosen. The elect believe themselves to be unquestioned masters of their special domain— and so they were for many years. From the middle of the nineteenth to the end of the twentieth centuries, the public lacked the means to question, much less contradict, authoritative judgments derived from monopolies of information. Most people in authority today came to their positions in that happy time. On moral as well as intellectual grounds, they dismiss the outsider out of hand. Their reflexive loathing of the amateur trespasser inspired Hoder’s 19½-year sentence and the mutual annihilation lawsuits against Shawn Fanning and Napster. Of course, the ferocity of this response can be explained in part by a fear of losing access to power and money. Authority has been closely associated with both—it’s a natural connection. Power needs accurate intelligence on which to act. Monopoly has always been a position from which to exploit the market. If I stop thinking in generalities and imagine a concrete person in authority, I’ll conjure up a policeman, a politician, a banker. The links between authority on one side and power and money on the other are dense and often invisible to the public. But each exerts a discrete influence on social relations, and of the three, I believe authority to be easily the most consequential. Even in purely practical terms, persuasion has always trumped compulsion or bribery. The authorizing magic of legitimacy can channel social behavior more deeply and permanently than the policeman’s club or the millionaire’s check. These propositions should be considered truisms, but they are not. Not by the public, which, as we have seen, assumes that every failure of authority must be explained by a collusion of money with power...

> When asked about the impact of the French Revolution, Zhou Enlai was supposed to have responded: “It is too soon to say.” In that one instance, if true, Zhou spoke as an honest political analyst rather than a revolutionary prophet. The crisis of authority hollowing out existing institutions didn’t arise because these institutions prostituted themselves to power or money. That was an explanation after the fact—one that happened to be believed by much of the public and many experts. The fact that needed to be explained, however, was failure: the painfully visible gap between the institutions’ claims of competence and their actual performance. The gap, I maintain, was a function of the limits of human knowledge. It had always been there. What changed was the public’s awareness of it. In the industrial age, the pratfalls of authority had been managed discreetly, camouflaged by the mystique of the expert at the top of his game. Today failure happens out in the open, in public, where everyone can see. With the arrival of the global information sphere, each failure is captured, reproduced, multiplied, amplified, and made to stand for authority as a whole. Crisis has followed logically from the destruction of the persuasive power—the legitimacy and credibility—possessed by established institutions. The focus of this book has been on politics, because I am personally concerned about the future of democracy, but also because I was an analyst of political events for most of my life. That was my own special domain. But I could just as well have made the precarious future of scientific institutions or the universities the overarching theme of my book. The battleground is everywhere. The assault on authority has expanded to virtually every point in the social landscape where an established hierarchy confronts a public in command of the new platforms of communication." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Much has been claimed for the scientific method, but the only method to which all scientists subscribe is the peer review process. It too has been under strain. Peer review presupposes the existence of independent-minded experts who evaluate manageable data sets. Often, in the age of the Fifth Wave, neither condition applies. Scientists today work in teams, and the subject matter can be so specialized that only a handful of individuals will be able to understand and review the literature. Authors and reviewers can trade places in a chummy circle of mutual admiration and protection. In extreme cases, this constriction of knowledge leads to what one analyst has called “research cartels,” which actively stifle minority or unorthodox views.
>
> At the same time, as in every other domain, the volume of data which must be reviewed has proliferated beyond the capacity of the establishment to absorb. Complicated computer programs have become necessary to array and model the data, and high-level statistical skills are routinely required to assess the validity of any finding. Many scientists, including reviewers, have not been up to the job. The peer review process, relic of a simpler time, has thus become progressively less able to guarantee the integrity and legitimacy of research in many fields of science.
>
> Since 1919, in sum, the practice of science migrated from the sectarian Border, where Einstein clearly originated, to a Center dominated by large, bureaucratic institutions. Practicing scientists were absorbed into hierarchies responsive to command from the top. The distance between professional and amateur—Einstein, let us recall, was one of the latter—grew immensely, and the usual barriers were erected to keep out trespassers from the inner temple of authority. The cost of scientific journals, for example, became prohibitive, so that only institutions could afford a subscription. Titles and tenure and awards proliferated. In this regard, the behavior of the scientific establishment paralleled that of government, the news industry, and the other institutions of the industrial age. All claimed monopolies over information to justify an assertion of unquestioned authority.

> "The emails showed the world’s leading climatologists busily working to organize a research cartel. Peer review was a legitimate source of authority when the process supported their positions. It was compromised, if not malicious, when it offered critics of the orthodoxy a platform. The wish to crush dissenting views, in their minds, had become indistinguishable from the pursuit of truth. In this attempt they ultimately failed, but not, the emails revealed, for lack of trying." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "People on the left believe that science is a tool of Big Business, that scientists are willing to poison us with genetically modified food and torture laboratory animals to earn a bigger profit for their paymasters. This may be an exaggeration, but, as a general proposition, it’s accurate enough. Corporations undeniably pay for and control a substantial percentage of all scientific research.
>
> For people on the right, science has become the handmaiden of Big Government, raising climate and environmental scares to justify the imposition of ever more restrictive political controls over every aspect of life. And this, too, while overstating the case, is generally correct. Government favor is the single most important factor in science research today. It’s disingenuous to imagine that such favor would be granted without considerations of power and political advantage." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The public can strike at a corporation, ferociously and with the speed of light, when it feels that its peculiar interests have been threatened. An example was the backlash against GoDaddy, after that company announced its support of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), a measure which sought to expand the reach of copyright law over web content. A boycott organized online was so successful that within 24 hours GoDaddy had caved in and proclaimed its opposition to SOPA. The incident was short-lived: once GoDaddy changed its stand, the protests ended. But it demonstrated the public’s ability to unleash chaos on the marketplace, if it were interested in doing so." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Beyond the intrusion of business consultants skimming billions off their corporate clients, little has changed structurally since Henry Ford’s day. If change does arrive—if the speed and freedom of networking can somehow be wedded to the mass and stability of hierarchy—it will represent a transformation in human relations as radical as any in history. Until that apocalyptic moment, I imagine that the savage churning of corporate births and deaths will continue to accelerate." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "If I were a doctor attempting to diagnose this particular sickness—the crisis of authority—I would look for definite causal patterns and symptoms. Among the patterns I would include exaggerated expectations by the public, abetted by exaggerated claims of competence by authority. I must believe that seismologists can save me from earthquakes, that the chairman of the Fed has tamed the business cycle: and these authorities must either believe the same thing, or, at a minimum, collude in my delusions.
>
> A second causal pattern would be the elites’ loss of control over the story told about their performance, particularly when it has failed to meet expectations. Such control, I noted, is a function of monopoly, so another way to diagnose this pattern is to determine whether the public has broken the institutions’ grip on information and communication. Climatologists conspiring to silence dissident views must believe that their data is a professional secret and their private emails are inviolable, while the public must be able to see the emperor in all his nakedness, and to disseminate that unimpressive image globally. The effect will be a growing distrust and loss of legitimacy.
>
> A third pattern would be the rise of alternative centers of authority. This is a corollary of the loss of monopoly. Once the conversation broadens and the public takes command, the dynamic isn’t that of Einstein scrutinizing the cosmos from his mountaintop, but of Michael Mann and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change looking over their shoulders at Steve McIntyre and his blog. Each vital community formed by amateurs interested in an affair becomes a threat to the authority of the institutions." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The political and expert classes claimed competence over settled truth. That’s who they were, what they did: they produced certainty and erased doubt. But if certainty is a function of authority, then a symptom of authority’s decline will be a radical and generalized uncertainty surrounding important questions. Alas, no instrument exists to measure certainty or its lack: but it is instructive to compare our mindset on this question with that of our parents and grandparents.
>
> Sixty years ago, Einstein spoke with the voice of God. Thirty years ago, Walter Cronkite every day told us “the way it is,” and the New York Times delivered to our doorsteps “All the news that’s fit to print.” Twenty years ago, Alan Greenspan applied infallible formulas to ensure our prosperity. When I was a boy and factual disputes arose in my family, they were settled by consulting the Encyclopedia Britannica. Back then, the world of information was shaped like a pyramid. Those at the top decided signal from noise, knowledge from fraud, certainty from uncertainty. The public and mass media embraced this arrangement. All things being equal, authority was trusted and relied on.
>
> Today we drown in data, yet thirst for meaning. That world-transforming tidal wave of information has disproportionately worsened the noise-to-signal ratio. According to Taleb, “The more data you get, the less you know what’s going on.” 67 And the more you know, the less you trust, as the gap between reality and the authorities’ claims of competence becomes impossible to ignore. If the IPCC climatologists fear a dispute with skeptics, how can they be believed? If the Risk Commission seismologists can’t warn us about catastrophic risk, who will? As I tried to show in this chapter, the public has lost faith in the people on whom it relied to make sense of the world—journalists, scientists, experts of every stripe. By the same process, the elites have lost faith in themselves.
>
> And the magisterial Encyclopedia Britannica? Gone the way of the dodo. Its place has been taken by Wikipedia, which, with its “edits” and “reverts” for many entries, leaves the reader uncertain about the agenda of any given version.
>
> Lack of certainty isn’t ignorance: it’s a splinter of doubt festering in all we know, a radical disillusionment with the institutions of settled truth. One important effect has been a sort of cultural barroom brawl, as every question of significance becomes an irritant and source of strife between interested parties." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Uncertainty, in this struggle, reflects a negation of the standing structures of knowledge. Impermanence signifies the demolition of the current structures of power and money. A large empty space, a conceptual hole, a nothingness, is in the process of creation, where once a complex society wrestled institutionally with its own contradictions and fallacies. Liberal democracy has been the chief mechanism for mediating such internal flaws. The question of nihilism, now inextricably tangled with the crisis of authority, will be answered in terms which either affirm or negate the legitimacy of the democratic process." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The aims of democratic government have shifted, even if the language of politics has yet to catch up. High modernist government was an austere prophet, demanding the destruction of the muddled present to make room for the perfect future. Late modernist government is more like a kindly uncle, passing out chocolate chip cookies to his favorite nieces and nephews. He doesn’t wish to transform them. He just wants them to be happy—most particularly, with him.
>
> If high modernism in power was an engine of perfection, late modernism has become a happiness machine. It feels bound to intervene anywhere it has identified groups that were somehow victimized, disabled, troubled, below average, offended, uncomfortable—actually or potentially unhappy. Its actions are the political equivalent of handing out a chocolate chip cookie: government today desperately wishes to be seen doing something, anything, to help, and be recognized for its good intentions. There are no boundaries to intervention, but no epic outcomes either. Elected officials know perfectly well that the public is on the move, and are terrified of the consequences. Their chief ambition is to persuade us that they feel our pain, are on our side, have given a little money to our favorite cause, if only we, the public, allow them to last out their terms in peace." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The hypothesis of the revolt of the public, if true, must have profound consequences for the conduct of government. Hierarchy, slow to respond and easy to surprise, has lost the argument in the information sphere before it began. Trust and legitimacy have bled away from those whose task it is to summon the collective will to action. Rulers everywhere are pale, trembling prisoners of their own rhetoric. Democratic rulers, for purely historical reasons, are condemned to propose ambitious projects and assert extravagant claims of competence: that’s the way the game is played.

The result has been persistent failure." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "A vast structural collision—pre-eminently, the revolt of the public against authority—has left democratic governments burdened with failure, democratic politics far removed from reality, and democratic programs drained of creative energy, and thus of hope. At this point, the nihilist makes his appearance. He is not a philosopher with an elaborated ideology, or a political figure leading an organization. Membership in the Nihilist Party cannot be had for love or money. Rather, the nihilist is merely reacting, as all human beings must, to the pressures applied by his environment: which means, in this case, that he is acting to destroy that environment.
>
> If I’m correct with this line of analysis, the nihilist, while essentially at war with himself, will happily bring down the entire edifice of democracy as part of his suicide pact. He has taken radicalism to its logical extreme.

That has been the business of Christian bishops and White House press secretaries: to impose the justifying story on the chaos of events.

Deep beneath the mass extinction of justifying stories, beneath the failure of government and the living death of democracy, the slow- motion collision of the public against authority, at once cause and consequence of those surface dramas, grinds on. Elites can’t preserve a status quo that the public is unwilling to transform.

By this I mean that, in a world of contingent outcomes, each of us will be faced with choices, and that our choices will come wrapped in a fatal question.

> The choices are the obvious ones of picking sides, of involvement and non- involvement. The question will relate to the vastness of the system within which the conflict is taking place, and the smallness of each person.

Only the highest reaches of government, therefore, have the capacity to choose the path ahead. The rest of us belong to the inert masses. These assumptions were always undemocratic in spirit, but, more importantly, they have been falsified by the experience of the last 50 years. Heroic top-down initiatives have failed, habitually and in their own terms. The masses have awakened to political life in the unruly public, and the tremendous energies released by the Fifth Wave have surged entirely from below. Ideologies justifying hierarchical control over society have faltered, fallen, and begun to go extinct.

But something along these lines will either be done by the government or likely will be done to it. The public is on the move. The age, recall, is stuck at midnight. I don’t do prophecy, so call it speculation: but I feel certain that, to the extent government stands aloof from the global information sphere, to that exact degree the information sphere, in the form of Tea Party-like revolts and Wikileaks-style revelations, will burst back, uninvited and destructive, into the precincts of power." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "By placing before the public the early drafts of government business, elected officials and their expert-bureaucrats will bring themselves down to earth. They will allow the public to catch them in the act of making assumptions, trade-offs, best guesses. Government will be demystified, as nature was after the scientific revolution. This will temper the public’s expectations of the outcome. If the minutes of the Risk Commission’s meeting in L’Aquila had been immediately posted online, the criminal prosecutions that ensued probably would have been avoided: scientific failure would have been understood to be a consequence of the limits of human knowledge.

> "Fukuyama, a Hegelian, argued that Western democracy had run out of “contradictions”: that is, of ideological alternatives. That was true in 1989 and remains true today. Fukuyama’s mistake was to infer that the absence of contradictions meant the end of history. There was another possibility he failed to consider.
>
> History could well be driven by negation rather than contradiction. It could ride on the nihilistic rejection of the established order, regardless of alternatives or consequences. That would not be without precedent. The Roman Empire wasn’t overthrown by something called “feudalism”—it collapsed of its own dead weight, to the astonishment of friend and foe alike. The centuries after the calamity lacked ideological form. Similarly, a history built on negation would be formless and nameless: a shadowy moment, however long, between one true age and another.
>
> The end of the Cold War, in which Fukuyama discerned the millennial triumph of democracy, appears in hindsight to have been the high-water mark for the prestige and legitimacy of this system. Once the external pressure applied by communism was removed, democratic countries lost their internal cohesion, and began the slow descent into negation. The failures of high modernism became painfully evident, when detached from the epic canvas of a life-and-death struggle. The industrial mode of organization, with its militaristic respect for rank, had placed democratic government at a great distance from the governed. Lacking a shared enemy and the urgency of a war footing, public and authority discovered they stood on the opposite sides of many questions.
>
> Then the Fifth Wave swept over the political landscape, giving voice and image and persuasive power to the insistent negations of the public. The result, if my analysis has any validity, has been the bleeding out of legitimacy and living death of many democratic institutions." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The democratic process is in peril of self-negation. The public’s mood swings are driven by failures of government, not hope for change. Each failure bleeds legitimacy from the system, erodes faith in the machinery of democracy, and paves the way for the opposite extreme. Democracy lacks true rivals today as an ideal and an ideology. Fukuyama was indeed half right. But there is a decadence in certain historical moments, an entropy of systems, propelled by an internal dynamic, that makes no demands for alternative ideals or structures before the onset of disintegration. At some point, failure becomes final." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Extremist kooks and cranks have always enjoyed wild conspiracy-mongering more than dull reality. With the collapse of the mediator class, this toxic mindset is seeping into the mainstream. When the neo-Nazis of The Stormer look on America, they see a “race war” against whites and “filthy Jew terrorists” in charge of the government. That is crazed bigotry posing as truth. But when the elites look on the neo-Nazis, they don’t see a tiny band of attention-starved bigots: they discern instead the awful consequences of Donald Trump in power. Nazis become a symbolic judgment on Trump—much as, for Trump, electoral fraud is a symbolic judgment on his enemies. Even if objectively false, both propositions embody truth as it should be. Once that door is open, strange things start to happen. The very liberal news media has glamorized neo-Nazis and racialists by lavishing attention on them wholly disproportionate to their numbers, making creepy marginal characters seem like important actors in US politics." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "To have any hope of reversing this trend, the elites must counter negation with a positive vision—a shared adventure—that includes and persuades the public. Politicians must tell a story about the world that stirs the imagination of voters. The people at the top must raise the public’s understanding to a higher plane. In the attempt, however, they will collide head-on with the social imperatives of the system they represent. The industrial model of liberal democracy isn’t particularly democratic in structure. It’s a steep hierarchy that operates in broadcast mode only. The distance between top and bottom is very great. The chasm of distrust will be difficult to bridge. And as elite fear and loathing of the public has increased, so has the craving for distance and isolation.
>
> Elites today have no idea how to speak to the public or what to say to it. They have shown little interest in trying. The hyper-educated individuals who ran the Clinton campaign were utterly indifferent to public opinion: they believed in big data. An algorithm nicknamed “Ada” delivered “simulations” of opinion to the campaign staff. 127 Ada was the public as elites wish it would be: safe, clean, and speaking only when spoken to. The voter in the flesh was clearly perceived by this group as an alien and frightening brute. His very existence was deplorable. The shock of Election Day followed naturally from such distortions of distance." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "Once government goes digital, it becomes possible to alter its structure, even to redirect its purpose. As imagined by the Pirate Party of Iceland, government can evolve into more of a transactional platform—part Facebook page, part Amazon marketplace—and less of an all-knowing solver of problems. Political expectations would be drastically adjusted. So would the relationship of information and power, reversing, at last, the pathological imbalances of the Fifth Wave. Direct democracy, in the form of referendums, would be invoked regularly, to good ends and bad.
>
> To ask why these changes aren’t happening is to circle back to the beginning of the conversation. The people at the top are unable and unwilling to reform or adapt. The distance to the bottom has protected the elites from their own inertia and decadence. If, as the evidence suggests, that distance is rapidly decreasing, then an entire ruling class, and a familiar mode of dealing with and talking about politics and the uses of power, face the possibility of extinction." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The revolt of the public... is a technology-driven churning of new people and classes, a proliferation and confusion of message and noise, utopian hopes and nihilistic rage, globalization and disintegration, taking place in the unbearable personal proximity of the web and at a fatal distance from political power." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The great motive power of the revolt isn’t economic resentment but outrage over distance and failure. Everyday life is increasingly digital and networked. From dating to hailing a cab, most social and commercial transactions occur at the speed of light. This mode of life incessantly collides with the lumbering hierarchies we have inherited from the industrial age. Modern government, above all, is institutionally unable to grasp that it has lost its monopoly over political reality. It behaves as if imposture and depravity will never be found out: but under the digital dispensation, everything is found out. The public is accustomed to proximity but finds the exercise of power removed an impossible distance away: reasons are never given, questions are never answered...
>
> The immediate target of revolt is an elite class that has failed persistently, on its own terms. The elites once were wrapped in the mantle of authority and delivered grandiose national projects, but now the public knows them too well, and they can only mutter and stammer, demoralized. They loathe the public for their humiliation. Politicians have lost faith in the idea of service, or the common interest, or the promotion of some universal cause or ideology: they exist, in office, merely to survive, or more accurately to be seen surviving, to suck up the attention of mass and social media. It has come to pass that presidents are chosen from the casts of reality TV shows. Political actors more and more resemble the real actors in Hollywood, whose company they keep and whose perverse predilections they seem to share.

> Liberal democracy predates the industrial world and is now struggling to survive it. It must shake off many of the forms and the rhetoric of the past 150 years in the manner of a snake shaking off its skin, and for the same reason: in order to grow. The digital universe has brought into being an overactive public whose numbers are unprecedented in human experience. Political room must be found for it somehow. The current elite class is probably unable and certainly unwilling to entertain this transformation. So far as the public is concerned, the elites have forsaken their function and thereby lost any claim to legitimacy.
>
> Yet democracy in a complex society can’t dispense with elites. That is the hard reality of the situation. Much more is involved than a need for specialized or esoteric knowledge. Today’s tastes may run to egalitarianism, but across history and cultures the only way to organize humanity, and get things done, has been through some level of command and control within a formal hierarchy. We are probably hard-wired to respond to this pattern. The pyramid can be made flatter or steeper, and a matrix of informal networks is invariably overlaid on it: but the structural necessity holds. Only a tiny minority can be bishops of the church. This may seem apparent when it comes to running a government or managing a corporation, but it applies with equal strength to the dispensation of certainty and truth.

> If my analysis is anywhere close to the mark, the re-formation of liberal democracy, and the recovery of truth, must wait on the emergence of a legitimate elite class." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "How does one group replace another at the top of the pyramid? The study of social change is burdened with many preconceptions regarding the primacy of economic factors, the exploitation and liberation of minority groups, the rise and fall of the bourgeoisie or the proletariat, and so forth. By a stroke of luck, I lack the erudition to take a stand on any of these weighty subjects. Instead, I’ll revert to an old analytic trick and pose a simpler question.

> How is a legitimate hierarchy formed? ...
>
> Hierarchy arises out of a natural impulse to self-improvement, and is legitimate when, in an almost Darwinian manner, it is “selected.”
>
> Ortega held the process to be the driving force of history. The “reciprocal action between the masses and select minorities,” he wrote, “is the fundamental fact of every society and the agent of its evolution for good or evil.” Ortega’s masses we now call the public. By “select minorities” he meant the admirable few: elites who, at their best, lavish their creative energies on the effort to sustain and enrich the fabric of contemporary life. These are the truly superior artists and technologists, preachers and politicians.
>
> In the right relation between elites and the public, the former act as exemplars to the latter. They embody and live out the master narratives. We can think of George Washington returning to his farm after the Revolution as a striking example. Abe Lincoln in his childhood log cabin and Tom Edison chasing the perfect filament also fit the type. It almost didn’t matter what these historic figures were like in person: whether they were lovable or jerks. The outline of their lives had displayed magnificently admirable traits, and previous generations of Americans agreed with Ortega on the power of exemplarity to raise human life to a higher plane.
>
> The quality that sets the true elites apart—that bestows authority on their actions and expressions—isn’t power, or wealth, or education, or even persuasiveness. It’s integrity in life and work. A healthy society is one in which such exemplary types draw the public toward them purely by the force of their example. Without compulsion, ordinary persons aspire to resemble the extraordinary, not superficially but fundamentally, because they wish to partake of superior models of being or doing. The good society, Ortega concluded, was an “engine of perfection.
>
> In a sickly society, the force of exemplarity is reversed. Elites seek to flatter and imitate the public. They make a display of popular tastes and attitudes, even as they retreat behind barricades of bodyguards and metal-detecting machines. This, of course, is what I meant by distance: a moral alienation felt even more keenly than the structural divide.
>
> Relations between top and bottom, Ortega asserted, were “reciprocal.” Elites are in some sense selected by the public. If we were to ask how that selection works, Ortega would reply: by aspiration. When elites fail the test of exemplarity— when, as is the case today, they repel rather than attract—they are unselected. They are stripped of legitimacy and authority...
>
> ... Legitimacy depends on a shared interpretation of events: and to be shared, to be perceived equally by contradictory perspectives, a story must go light on raging at symbolic phantoms in favor of the demonstrable and the concrete.
>
> ...
>
> The present need is for a re-formation of the system and the restoration of authority. The practice of democracy must accommodate the existence of an enormous and super-opinionated public. Political action must approach the speed and proximity expected by an electorate that lives, works, and shops on digital media. The change can occur in many different ways, but a few hard truths are apparent from where I stand. The top-down political style, a relic of the last century, today appears false and fraudulent even when it is sincere. The extension of social distance as a reward for political success is perceived, rightly, as contrary to the democratic spirit. The elites now directing our great institutions are unalterably wedded to top-down control and increased distance from the rabble. Their resistance will make the necessary changes very difficult to achieve.
>
> As members of the public, we—by which I mean you, reader, and I—are not helpless. We are not inert. We retain the power to select and unselect, and we wield that power constantly—not only in our political participation, our votes and donations, but in the books we read, the television we watch, the performances we attend, the products we purchase. If, as I believe, Ortega’s framework of legitimacy was broadly correct, we can replace a failed elite class with another that is worthier of our aspirations. Fundamental change is possible, and can come peacefully and quickly. That’s the good news.

> The big question is where to find a “select minority” that embodies the set of virtues required to lead democracy into the digital age, and can draw the public, by force of example, toward those virtues." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The qualities I would look for among elites to get politics off this treadmill are honesty and humility: old-school virtues, long accepted to be the living spirit behind the machinery of the democratic republic, though now almost lost from sight. The reformers of democracy must learn to say, out loud for all to hear, “This is a process of trial and error,” and, “We are uncertain of the consequences,” and even, “I was wrong.” Elected officials must approximate the ability of scientists and businessmen—and, for that matter, ordinary households —to identify failure and move on. Honesty means that the relationship to truth, as truth is perceived, matters more than ambition or partisan advantage. Humility means that the top of the pyramid looks to the public as a home it will return to rather than a carnivorous species from which to hide. Truth must be spoken even when it hurts the speaker or the audience. Distance must be reduced to a minimum, even at the risk of physical danger." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

> "The crucial move if we are to surmount our predicament isn’t transformation but reorientation, a turn in direction away from top-down control, bureaucratic power, and the high valuation of distance as a reward for political success. Such a reorientation strikes me as perfectly possible.
>
> In the end, everything will hinge on the public: on us. If Ortega was correct, then we have lost the right to rant about our rulers. Instead, we must go about the job of selecting their successors. We can lavish our attention and our energies strictly on politicians who seem unwilling to lie or simplify or distort to advantage. We can identify and raise up those who refuse to climb above us. That’s one fork in the path ahead: another leads to nihilism. Either way, the choice is ours." - [The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority, by Martin Gurri](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/22451908)

The world cannot be run by such a minority of escaped and re-educated minds alone, with all the rest of the heap against them.

The leaders in every great religious movement have considered it necessary that it should explain itself in the form of history and a cosmogony. It has been felt necessary to say Why? and To what end? Every religion therefore has had to adopt the physical conceptions, and usually also to assume many of the moral and social values, current at the time of its formation.

>
> A number of readers will be disposed to say that this is a very vague, undefined, and complicated conception of world government. But indeed it is a simplification. Not only are the present governments of the world a fragmentary competitive confusion, but none of them is as simple as it appears. They seem to be simple because they have formal heads and definite forms, councils, voting assemblies, and so forth, for arriving at decisions. But the formal heads, the kings, presidents, and so forth, are really not the directive heads. They are merely the figure heads. They do not decide. They merely make gestures of potent and dignified acquiescence when decisions are put to them. They are complicating shams. Nor do the councils and assemblies really decide. They record, often very imperfectly and exasperatingly, the accumulating purpose of outer forces. These outer really directive forces are no doubt very intricate in their operation; they depend finally on religious and educational forms and upon waves of gregarious feeling, but it does not in the least simplify the process of collective human activity to pretend that it is simple and to set up symbols and dummies in the guise of rulers and dictators to embody that pretence. To recognize the incurable intricacy of collective action is a mental simplification; to remain satisfied with the pretensions of existing governmental institutions, and to bring in all the problems of their procedure and interaction is to complicate the question.
>
> The present rudimentary development of collective psychology obliges us to be vague and provisional about the way in which the collective mind may best define its will for the purpose of administrative action. We may know that a thing is possible and still be unable to do it as yet, just as we knew that aviation was possible in 1900. Some method of decision there must certainly be and a definite administrative machinery. But it may turn out to be a much slighter, less elaborate organization than a consideration of existing methods might lead us to imagine. It may never become one single interlocking administrative system. We may have systems of world control rather than a single world state. The practical regulations, enforcements, and officials needed to keep the world in good health, for example may be only very loosely related to the system of controls that will maintain its communications in a state of efficiency. Enforcement and legal decisions, as we know them now, may be found to be enormously and needlessly cumbrous by our descendants. As the reasonableness of a thing is made plain, the need for its enforcement is diminished, and the necessity for litigation disappears.

> The Open Conspiracy, the world movement for the supercession or enlargement or fusion of existing political, economic, and social institutions must necessarily, as it grows, draw closer and closer to questions of practical control. It is likely in its growth to incorporate many active public servants and many industrial and financial leaders and directors. It may assimilate great masses of intelligent workers. As its activities spread it will work out a whole system of special methods of co-operation. As it grows, and by growing, it will learn the business of general direction and how to develop its critical function. A lucid, dispassionate, and immanent criticism is the primary necessity, the living spirit of a world civilization. The Open Conspiracy is essentially such a criticism, and the carrying out of such a criticism into working reality is the task of the Open Conspiracy.

> "But as soon as this time-honoured preoccupation with the allotment of the shares of originators, organizers, workers, owners of material, credit dealers, and tax collectors in the total product, ceases to be dealt with as the primary question in economics; as soon as we liberate our minds from a preoccupation which from the outset necessarily makes that science a squabble rather than a science, and begin our attack upon the subject with a survey of the machinery and other productive material required in order that the staple needs of mankind should be satisfied, if we go on from that to consider the way in which all this material and machinery can be worked and the product distributed with the least labour and the greatest possible satisfaction, we shift our treatment of economic questions towards standards by which all current methods of exploitation, employment, and finance can be judged rather than wrangled over. We can dismiss the question of the claims of this sort of participant or that, for later and subordinate consideration, and view each variety of human assistance in the general effort entirely from the standpoint of what makes that assistance least onerous and most effective.
>
> The germs of such really scientific economics exist already in the study of industrial organization and industrial psychology. As the science of industrial psychology in particular develops, we shall find all this discussion of ownership, profit, wages, finance, and accumulation, which has been treated hitherto as the primary issues of economics, falling into place under the larger enquiry of what conventions in these matters, what system of money and what conceptions of property, yield the greatest stimulus and the least friction in that world-wide system of co-operation which must constitute the general economic basis to the activities of a unified mankind.
>
> Manifestly the supreme direction of the complex of human economic activities in such a world must centre upon a bureau of information and advice, which will take account of all the resources of the planet, estimate current needs, apportion productive activities and control distribution. The topographical and geological surveys of modern civilized communities, their government maps, their periodic issue of agricultural and industrial statistics, are the first crude and unco-ordinated beginnings of such an economic world intelligence. In the propaganda work of David Lubin, a pioneer whom mankind must not forget, and in his International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, there were the beginnings of an impartial review month by month and year by year of world production, world needs and world transport. Such a great central organization of economic science would necessarily produce direction; it would indicate what had best be done here, there, and everywhere, solve general tangles, examine, approve and initiate fresh methods and arrange the transitional process from old to new. It would not be an organization of will, imposing its will upon a reluctant or recalcitrant race; it would be a direction, just as a map is a direction.
>
> A map imposes no will on anyone, breaks no one in to its "policy." And yet we obey our maps.
>
> The will to have the map full, accurate, and up to date, and the determination to have its indications respected, would have to pervade the whole community. To nourish and sustain that will must be the task not of any particular social or economic division of the community, but of the whole body of right-minded people in that community. The organization and preservation of that power of will is the primary undertaking, therefore, of a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity. And through that will it will produce as the central organ the brain of the modern community, a great encyclopædic organization, kept constantly up to date and giving approximate estimates and directions for all the material activities of mankind.
>
> The older and still prevalent conception of government is bullying, is the breaking-in and subjugation of the "subject," to the God, or king, or lords of the community. Will-bending, the overcoming of the recalcitrant junior and inferior, was an essential process in the establishment of primitive societies, and its tradition still rules our education and law. No doubt there must be a necessary accommodation of the normal human will to every form of society; no man is innately virtuous; but compulsion and restraint are the friction of the social machine and, other things being equal, the less compulsive social arrangements are, the more willingly, naturally, and easily they are accepted, the less wasteful of moral effort and the happier that community will be. The ideal state, other things being equal, is the state with the fewest possible number of will fights and will suppressions. This must be a primary consideration in arranging the economic, biological, and mental organization of the world community at which we aim.
>
> We have advanced the opinion that the control of population pressure is practicable without any violent conflict with "human nature," that given a proper atmosphere of knowledge and intention, there need be far less suppression of will in relation to production than prevails to-day. In the same way, it is possible that the general economic life of mankind may be made universally satisfactory that there may be an abundance out of all comparison greater than the existing supply of things necessary for human well-being, freedom, and activity, with not merely not more, but infinitely less subjugation and enslavement than now occurs. Man is still but half born out of the blind struggle for existence, and his nature still partakes of the infinite wastefulness of his mother Nature. He has still to learn how to price the commodities he covets in terms of human life. He is indeed only beginning to realize that there is anything to be learnt in that matter. He wastes will and human possibility extravagantly in his current economic methods.
>
> We know nowadays that the nineteenth century expended a great wealth of intelligence upon a barren controversy between Individualism and Socialism. They were treated as mutually exclusive alternatives, instead of being questions of degree. Human society has been is and always must be an intricate system of adjustments between unconditional liberty and the disciplines and subordinations of co-operative enterprise. Affairs do not move simply from a more individualist to a more socialist state or vice versa; there may be a release of individual initiative going on here and standardization or restraint increasing there. Personal property never can be socially guaranteed as the extremer individualists desired, nor can it be "abolished" as the extremer socialists proposed. Property is not robbery, as Proudhon asserted; it is the protection of things against promiscuous and mainly wasteful use. Property is not necessarily personal. In some cases property may restrict or forbid a use of things that could be generally advantageous, and it may be and is frequently unfair in its assignment of initiative, but the remedy for that is not an abolition but a revision of property. In the concrete it is a form necessary for liberty of action upon material, while abstracted as money, which is a liquidated generalized form of property; it is a ticket for individual liberty of movement and individual choice of reward.
>
> The economic history of mankind is a history of the operation of the idea of property; it relates the conflict of the unlimited acquisitiveness of egoistic individuals against the resentment of the disinherited and unsuccessful and the far less effective consciousness of a general welfare. Money grew out of a system of abstracting conventions and has been subjected to a great variety of restrictions, monopolizations, and regulations. It has never been an altogether logical device, and it has permitted the most extensive and complex developments of credit, debt, and dispossession. All these developments have brought with them characteristic forms of misuse and corruption. The story is intricate, and the tangle of relationships, of dependence, of pressure, of interception, of misdirected services, crippling embarrassments, and crushing obligations in which we live to-day admits of no such simple and general solutions as many exponents of socialism, for example, seem to consider possible.
>
> But the thought and investigations of the past century or so have made it clear that a classification of property, according to the nature of the rights exercisable and according to the range of ownership involved, must be the basis of any system of social justice in the future.
>
> Certain things, the ocean, the air, rare wild animals, must be the collective property of all mankind and cannot be altogether safe until they are so regarded, and until some concrete body exists to exercise these proprietary rights. Whatever collective control exists must protect these universal properties, the sea from derelicts, the strange shy things of the wild from extermination by the hunter and the foolish collector. The extinction of many beautiful creatures is one of the penalties our world is paying for its sluggishness in developing a collective common rule. And there are many staple things and general needs that now also demand a unified control in the common interest. The raw material of the earth should be for all, not to be monopolized by any acquisitive individual or acquisitive sovereign state, and not to be withheld from exploitation for the general benefit of any chance claims to territorial priority of this or that backward or bargaining person or tribe.
>
> In the past, most of these universal concerns have had to be left to the competitive enterprise of profit-seeking individuals because there were as yet no collectivities organized to the pitch of ability needed to develop and control these concerns, but surely nobody in his senses believes that the supply and distribution of staple commodities about the earth by irresponsible persons and companies working entirely for monetary gain is the best possible method from the point of view of the race as a whole. The land of the earth, all utilizable natural products, have fallen very largely under the rules and usages of personal property because in the past that was the only recognized and practicable form of administrative proprietorship. The development both of extensive proprietary companies and of government departments with economic functions has been a matter of the last few centuries, the development, that is to say, of communal, more or less impersonal ownership, and it is only through these developments that the idea of organized collectivity of proprietorship has become credible.
>
> ...
>
> But when we have stipulated for the replacement of individual private ownership by more highly organized forms of collective ownership, subject to free criticism and responsible to the whole republic of mankind, in the general control of sea and land, in the getting, preparation, and distribution of staple products and in transport, we have really named all the possible generalizations of concrete ownership that the most socialistic of contemporaries will be disposed to demand. And if we add to that the necessary maintenance of a money system by a central world authority upon a basis that will make money keep faith with the worker who earns it, and represent from first to last for him the value in staple commodities he was given to understand it was to have, and if we conceive credit adequately controlled in the general interest by a socialized world banking organization, we shall have defined the entire realm from which individual property and unrestricted individual enterprise have been excluded. Beyond that, the science of social psychology will probably assure us that the best work will be done for the world by individuals free to exploit their abilities as they wish. If the individual landowner or mineral-owner disappears altogether from the world, he will probably be replaced over large areas by tenants with considerable security of tenure, by householders and by licensees under collective proprietors. It will be the practice, the recognized best course, to allow the cultivator to profit as fully as possible by his own individual productivity and to leave the householder to fashion his house and garden after his own desire.
>
> Such in the very broadest terms is the character of the world commonweal towards which the modern imagination is moving, so far as its direction and economic life are concerned. The organization of collective bodies capable of exercising these wider proprietorships, which cannot be properly used in the common interest by uncorrelated individual owners, is the positive practical problem before the intelligent portion of mankind to-day. The nature of such collective bodies is still a series of open questions, even upon such points as whether they will be elected bodies or groups deriving their authority from other sanctions. Their scope and methods of operation, their relations to one another and to the central bureau of intelligence, remain also to be defined. But before we conclude this essay we may be able to find precisions for at least the beginning of such definition.
>
> Nineteenth-century socialism in its various forms, including the highly indurated formulae of communism, has been a series of projects for the establishment of such collective controls, for the most part very sketchy projects from which the necessary factor of a sound psychological analysis was almost completely wanting. Primarily movements of protest and revolt against the blazing injustices arising out of the selfishly individualistic exploitation of the new and more productive technical and financial methods of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they have been apt to go beyond the limits of reasonable socialization in their demands and to minimize absurdly the difficulties and dangers of collective control. Indignation and impatience were their ruling moods, and if they constructed little they exposed much. We are better able to measure the magnitude of the task before us because of the clearances and lessons achieved by these pioneer movements." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

> "THIS open and declared intention of establishing a world order out of the present patchwork of particularist governments, of effacing the militarist conceptions that have hitherto given governments their typical form, and of removing credit and the broad fundamental processes of economic life out of reach of private profit-seeking and individual monopolization, which is the substance of this Open Conspiracy to which the modern religious mind must necessarily address its practical activities, cannot fail to arouse enormous opposition. It is not a creative effort in a clear field; it is a creative effort that can hardly stir without attacking established things. It is the repudiation of drift, of "leaving things alone." It criticizes everything in human life from the top to the bottom and finds everything not good enough. It strikes at the universal human desire to feel that things are "all right."
>
> One might conclude, and it would be a hasty, unsound conclusion, that the only people to whom we could look for sympathy and any passionate energy in forwarding the revolutionary change would be the unhappy, the discontented, the dispossessed, and the defeated in life's struggle. This idea lies at the root of the class-war dogmas of the Marxists, and it rests on an entirely crude conception of human nature. The successful minority is supposed to have no effective motive but a desire to retain and intensify its advantages. A quite imaginary solidarity to that end is attributed to it, a preposterous, base class activity. On the other hand, the unsuccessful mass—"proletariat"—is supposed to be capable of a clear apprehension of its disadvantages, and the more it is impoverished and embittered, the clearer-minded it becomes, and the nearer draws its uprising, its constructive "dictatorship," and the Millennium.
>
> No doubt a considerable amount of truth is to be found in this theory of the Marxist revolution. Human beings, like other animals, are disposed to remain where their circumstances are tolerable and to want change when they are uncomfortable, and so a great proportion of the people who are "well off" want little or no change in present conditions, particularly those who are too dull to be bored by an unprogressive life, while a great proportion of those who actually feel the inconveniences of straitened means and population pressure, do. But much vaster masses of the rank and file of humanity are accustomed to inferiority and dispossession, they do not feel these things to the extent even of desiring change, or even if they do feel their disadvantages, they still fear change more than they dislike their disadvantages. Moreover, those who are sufficiently distressed to realize that "something ought to be done about it" are much more disposed to childish and threatening demands upon heaven and the government for redress and vindictive and punitive action against the envied fortunate with whom they happen to be in immediate contact, than to any reaction towards such complex, tentative, disciplined constructive work as alone can better the lot of mankind. In practice Marxism is found to work out in a ready resort to malignantly destructive activities, and to be so uncreative as to be practically impotent in the face of material difficulties. In Russia, where—in and about the urban centres, at least—Marxism has been put to the test, the doctrine of the Workers' Republic remains as a unifying cant, a test of orthodoxy of as little practical significance there as the communism of Jesus and communion with Christ in Christendom, while beneath this creed a small oligarchy which has attained power by its profession does its obstinate best, much hampered by the suspicion and hostility of the Western financiers and politicians, to carry on a series of interesting and varyingly successful experiments in the socialization of economic life. Here we have no scope to discuss the N.E.P. and the Five Year Plan. They are dealt with in The Work, Wealth, and Happiness of Mankind. Neither was properly Communist. The Five Year Plan is carried out as an autocratic state capitalism. Each year shows more and more clearly that Marxism and Communism are divagations from the path of human progress and that the line of advance must follow a course more intricate and less flattering to the common impulses of our nature.
>
> The one main strand of truth in the theory of social development woven by Marx and Engels is that successful, comfortable people are disposed to dislike, obstruct and even resist actively any substantial changes in the current patchwork of arrangements, however great the ultimate dangers of that patchwork may be or the privations and sufferings of other people involved in it. The one main strand of error in that theory is the facile assumption that the people at a disadvantage will be stirred to anything more than chaotic and destructive expressions of resentment. If now we reject the error and accept the truth, we lose the delusive comfort of belief in that magic giant, the Proletariat, who will dictate, arrange, restore, and create, but we clear the way for the recognition of an élite of intelligent, creative-minded people scattered through the whole community, and for a study of the method of making this creative element effective in human affairs against the massive oppositions of selfishness and unimaginative self-protective conservatism.

> Now, certain classes of people such as thugs and burglars seem to be harmful to society without a redeeming point about them, and others, such as racecourse bookmakers, seem to provide the minimum of distraction and entertainment with a maximum of mischief. Wilful idlers are a mere burthen on the community. Other social classes again, professional soldiers, for example, have a certain traditional honourableness which disguises the essentially parasitic relationship of their services to the developing modern community. Armies and armaments are cancers produced by the malignant development of the patriotic virus under modern conditions of exaggeration and mass suggestion. But since there are armies prepared to act coercively in the world to-day, it is necessary that the Open Conspiracy should develop within itself the competence to resist military coercion and combat and destroy armies that stand in the way of its emergence. Possibly the first two types here instanced may be condemned as classes and excluded as classes from any participation in the organized effort to recast the world, but quite obviously the soldier cannot. The world commonweal will need its own scientific methods of protection so long as there are people running about the planet with flags and uniforms and weapons, offering violence to their fellow men and interfering with the free movements of commodities in the name of national sovereignty.
>
> And when we come to the general functioning classes, landowners, industrial organizers, bankers, and so forth, who control the present system, such as it is, it should be still plainer that it is very largely from the ranks of these classes, and from their stores of experience and traditions of method, that the directive forces of the new order must emerge. The Open Conspiracy can have nothing to do with the heresy that the path of human progress lies through an extensive class war.
>
> Let us consider, for example, how the Open Conspiracy stands to such a complex of activities, usages, accumulations, advantages as constitutes the banking world. There are no doubt many bankers and many practices in banking which make for personal or group advantage to the general detriment. They forestall, monopolize, constrain, and extort, and so increase their riches. And another large part of that banking world follows routine and established usage; it is carrying on and keeping things going, and it is neither inimical nor conducive to the development of a progressive world organization of finance. But there remains a residuum of original and intelligent people in banking or associated with banking or mentally interested in banking, who do realize that banking plays a very important, interesting part in the world's affairs, who are curious about their own intricate function and disposed towards a scientific investigation of its origins, conditions, and future possibilities. Such types move naturally towards the Open Conspiracy. Their enquiries carry them inevitably outside the bankers' habitual field to an examination of the nature, drift, and destiny of the entire economic process.
>
> Now the theme of the preceding paragraph might be repeated with variations through a score of paragraphs in which appropriate modifications would adapt it to the industrial organizer, the merchant and organizer of transport, the advertiser, the retail distributor, the agriculturalist, the engineer, the builder, the economic chemist, and a number of other types functional in the contemporary community. In all we should distinguish firstly a base and harmful section, then a mediocre section following established usage, and lastly, an active, progressive section to whom we turn naturally for developments leading towards the progressive world commonweal of our desires. And our analysis might penetrate further than separation into types of individuals. In nearly every individual instance we should find a mixed composition, a human being of fluctuating moods and confused purposes, sometimes base, sometimes drifting with the tide and sometimes alert and intellectually and morally quickened. The Open Conspiracy must be content to take a fraction of a man, as it appeals to fractions of many classes, if it cannot get him altogether.
>
> This idea of drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection is a fairly obvious one—and yet it has still to win practical recognition. Man is a morbidly gregarious and partisan creature; he is deep in his immediate struggles and stands by his own kind because in so doing he defends himself; the industrialist is best equipped to criticize his fellow industrialist, but he finds the root of all evil in the banker; the wages worker shifts the blame for all social wrongs on the "employing class." There is an element of exasperation in most economic and social reactions, and there is hardly a reforming or revolutionary movement in history which is not essentially an indiscriminate attack of one functioning class or type upon another, on the assumption that the attacked class is entirely to blame for the clash and that the attacking class is self-sufficient in the commonweal and can dispense with its annoying collaborator. A considerable element of justice usually enters into such recriminations. But the Open Conspiracy cannot avail itself of these class animosities for its driving force. It can have, therefore, no uniform method of approach. For each class it has a conception of modification and development, and each class it approaches therefore at a distinctive angle. Some classes, no doubt, it would supersede altogether; others—the scientific investigator, for example—it must regard as almost wholly good and seek only to multiply and empower, but it can no more adopt the prejudices and extravagances of any particular class as its basis than it can adopt the claims of any existing state or empire.
>
> When it is clearly understood that the binding links of the Open Conspiracy we have in mind are certain broad general ideas, and that—except perhaps in the case of scientific workers—we have no current set of attitudes of mind and habits of activity which we can turn over directly and unmodified to the service of the conspiracy, we are in a position to realize that the movement we contemplate must from the outset be diversified in its traditions and elements and various in its methods. It must fight upon several fronts and with many sorts of equipment. It will have a common spirit, but it is quite conceivable that between many of its contributory factors there may be very wide gaps in understanding and sympathy.

Its opening task must be the elaboration, exposition, and propaganda of this common idea, a steady campaign to revolutionize education and establish a modern ideology in men's minds and, arising out of this, the incomparably vaster task of the realization of its ideas." - [The Open Conspiracy: What Are We To Do With Our Lives? by H.G.

A group or movement of students may find itself capable of little more than self-education and personal propaganda; a handful of middle-class people in small town may find its small resources fully engaged at first in such things as, for example, seeing that desirable literature is available for sale or in local public library, protecting books and news vendors from suppression, or influencing local teachers. Most parents of school children can press for the teaching of universal history and sound biology and protest against the inculcation of aggressive patriotism. There is much scope for the single individual in this direction.

A phase when there will be a special educational system for the Open Conspiracy seems, therefore, to be indicated.

> "The bent for reciprocal exchange is not the only aspect of human nature that helps propel society toward complexity. Evolutionary psychologists—and, for that matter, non-evolutionary psychologists—have shown that human beings naturally pursue social status with a certain ferocity. We all relentlessly, if often unconsciously, try to raise our standing by impressing peers. And we naturally, if unconsciously, evaluate other people in terms of their standing. We especially value the friendship of high-status people (since alliance with the powerful tends to come in handy), and we especially fear their disfavor (since the enmity of the powerful tends not to). Human beings evolved amid social hierarchies, and our minds are designed to negotiate them.
>
> This gives social complexity a head start in at least two ways. First, deference to the high and mighty (though the deference is far from reflexive, as we’ll see) paves the way for complex hierarchical organization. Hunter-gatherer peoples may or may not have a formally designated “headman,” but they recognize a leader when the occasion demands. Just look at how readily a Shoshone “rabbit boss” pops up when the rabbits do.
>
> Second, the ongoing quest for social status is a great spur to cultural innovation. We don’t know who invented the rabbit net, but we can safely assume it didn’t hurt his or her popularity. And so it is in all societies: one sure way to elevate your standing is to create something that is widely adopted and praised.
>
> There is an irony here. To compete for high-status positions is to play a zero-sum game, since they are by definition a scarce resource. Yet one way to compete successfully is to invent technologies that create new non-zero-sum games. This is one of various senses in which the impetus behind cultural evolution, behind social complexification, lies in a paradox of human nature: we are deeply gregarious, and deeply cooperative, yet deeply competitive. We instinctively play both non-zero-sum and zero-sum games. The interplay of these two dynamics throughout history is a story that takes some time to tell. For now I’ll just say that, though they have been responsible for much suffering, the tension between them is, in the end, creative." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The mixture of cooperative and competitive human instincts, the subtle but potent quest for status, the ingenuity it fuels—these were evident long before Darwinian theory came along to explain their reason for being. In the eighteenth century, for example, Immanuel Kant noted the “unsocial sociability” of man, with special emphasis on the “unsocial” part and its ironic consequences. “Through the desire for honor, power or property, it drives him to seek status among his fellows, whom he cannot bear yet cannot bear to leave.”41 Via this quest for status, “the first true steps are taken from barbarism to culture, which in fact consists in the social worthiness of man.” Thus commences “a continued process of enlightenment” as “all man’s talents are now gradually developed, his taste cultivated.”
>
> Without these “asocial qualities (far from admirable in themselves),” human beings “would live an Arcadian, pastoral existence of perfect concord, self-sufficiency and mutual love.42 But all human talents would remain hidden forever in a dormant state, and men, as good-natured as the sheep they tended, would scarcely render their existence more valuable than that of their animals.” In that event, “the end for which they were created, their rational nature, would be an unfilled void. Nature should thus be thanked for fostering social incompatibility, enviously competitive vanity, and insatiable desires for possession or even power.”
>
> Kant made those remarks in an essay called “Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose,” which suggested that human history embodied a “hidden plan of nature.”43 Perhaps as history unfolds, he wrote, we will see “how the human race eventually works its way upward to a situation in which all the germs implanted by nature can be developed fully, and in which man’s destiny can be fulfilled here on earth.” Kant imagined that this destiny would include enduring peace among nations, ensured by a kind of world governance—a final, ironic payoff for millennia of antagonism and “unsocial” striving.
>
> This was all conjecture, Kant stressed. Writing in 1784, before the harnessing of electricity, before the telegraph or typewriter or computer, he admitted that so far there was just “a little” evidence of such a “purposeful natural process.” Only time would tell. “For this cycle of events seems to take so long a time to complete, that the small part of it traversed by mankind up till now does not allow us to determine with certainty the shape of the whole cycle, and the relation of its parts to the whole.” Well, that was then." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

the whole of chapter 4 "the invisible brain" is a worthy quote

> "To say that writing transformed the potential for non-zero-sum interaction comes close to redundancy. For the link between information and non-zero-sumness is so basic that it’s hard to imagine deep changes in the former that wouldn’t deeply change the latter. Indeed, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that non-zero-sum dynamics are the reason information gets transmitted in the first place. As the pioneering game theorist Thomas Schelling has observed, in a purely zero-sum relationship, there is no rational reason to communicate. Opposing coaches have no cause to speak before a game. If you see them in extended conference, they’re probably talking about some non-zero-sum realm, where their interests partly overlap. Both want to avoid injured players, and may decide to reschedule a game in bad weather. But neither coach has an interest in honestly communicating anything about the game itself." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "If indeed barriers to information are one of the two basic impediments to non-zero-sum gain, then obviously new information technologies might unlock some positive sums. Yet the more dramatic effect of writing may have been to overcome the second barrier, the trust barrier. In ancient Mesopotamia, a lender didn’t have to fear that the borrower would deny all recollection of the loan, and the borrower didn’t have to fear that the lender would exaggerate it." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Writing was hardly the only thing in the ancient states of Asia, the Middle East, and Mesoamerica that helped solve the trust problem. Another was the systematization of justice: the assurance that cheaters will be punished. But even here, writing helps; legal codes carry more precision and heft when etched in something solid. The code of the Mesopotamian city of Eshnunna—written a century before the more famous code of Hammurabi—left no doubt what would happen if you paid a man a shekel to harvest your field and he never got around to it: he would pay you ten shekels... So the government had to build a new anti-cheating technology, a new technology of trust—trust not just in economic justice, but in the larger social contract, the mutual nonaggression pact that, by relieving people of fear and suspicion, smooths all kinds of cooperative efforts" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” depends on an invisible brain. And invisible brains depend on information technology. Not just conspicuous information technologies, like the abacus (though its “rediscovery” around A.D. 1,000, after centuries of European neglect, did help) or writing (though the growing literacy of the Middle Ages helped, too) or money (though the revival of currency was vital). At least as crucial was information technology in a subtler sense: what you might call information metatechnologies—social algorithms guiding the use of such information technologies as money. In particular, what made the later Middle Ages a bridge between ancient times and the industrial revolution was the rudimentary metatechnology of capitalism.
>
> Today we take for granted that the people who start a business and the people who provide the money for it are often not the same people. We have stock markets, limited partnerships, bank loans, and various other ways of turning John’s profits into Mary’s seed money. But this basic idea—efficiently converting savings into investment—had to be invented, and at the time the western Roman Empire fell apart, Europe’s machinery for capital formation had been crude. The Middle Ages changed that.
>
> In southern Europe the contratto di commenda, in use by the tenth century, allowed investors large and small to underwrite a ship’s trading expedition. They were guaranteed in writing a share of “the capital and the profit which God shall have granted.” The commenda was just one of many medieval tools for linking savings to investment. (By the fourteenth century, Venetian bankers had realized that they could lend out a fraction of their deposits, since depositers were unlikely to all withdraw their cash at once. The rest is European banking history.) All such instruments had this in common: they were distinct steps toward modern capitalism. Europe had long had markets for goods and services. Now it had markets for capital. It also had new ancillary metatechnologies of capitalism, such as insurance and double-entry bookkeeping.
>
> All to the good. But does this really answer the question of why the economic complexity of the late Middle Ages had been so slow in coming? If the missing ingredients were the various metatechnologies of capitalism, then the question becomes: Why had they taken so long to evolve? After all, once you’ve got coins and writing, all that stands between you and capitalism is a little imagination. In principle, there could have been stock exchanges—which finally showed up in the seventeenth century A.D.—in the seventh century B.C, when the Lydians started coining money. Why did nearly two millennia pass before European capitalism got off the ground?
>
> Maybe part of the answer lies in where exactly it did finally get off the ground: not in Byzantium, where ancient government and social structure endured, but in the west, where central rule collapsed, and tumult came and went and came, and authority was often dispersed. The average ancient ruling class, after all, would have blanched at full-fledged capitalism. For ordinary people to have potent ways of turning savings into investment meant a loss of leverage for aristocrats. What ships and grand buildings to build, and what to do with them—more and more of these decisions would now be made diffusely, by diverse investors and entrepreneurs, not centrally by the government and the entrenched elite. What’s more, the fruits of investment would now be hard to monopolize.
>
> This points to a general problem faced by ruling classes. To stay strong, a society must adopt new technologies. In particular, it must reap the non-zero-sum fruits they offer. Yet new technologies often redistribute power within societies. (They often do this precisely because they raise non-zero-sumness—because they expand the number of people who profit from the system and so wield power within it.) And if there is one opinion common to ruling classes everywhere, it is that power is not in urgent need of redistributing. Hence the Hobson’s choice for the governing elite: accept valuable technologies that may erode your power, or resist them so well that you may find yourself with nothing to govern. Maybe it was western Europe’s freedom from ancient elites that helped hasten the coming of capitalism.
>
> To be sure, western Europe in the Middle Ages, like ancient Rome, had elites who disliked big power shifts. The instinct of feudal lords was to exploit the emerging class of merchants with tolls at bridges and feudal bounds. But it didn’t take merchants long to sense their common interest. They united into guilds and demanded the freedoms necessary for commerce: not just freedom from outrageous tolls, but freedom to buy or sell property, freedom to enter into contracts—and freedom to decide what other freedoms they needed. Increasingly, in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, towns won the right of self-government, complete with their own courts and tax collection. What’s more, feudal lords soon realized that local prosperity was good for them, and that prosperity required a bit of this freedom. Some started not just granting charters of self-governance to towns, but founding towns in order to grant the charters.
>
> Why were these ruling elites more open to change than Rome’s ruling elites? One reason, some historians say, was the decentralized nature of feudalism. Feudal lords often had the leeway to rewrite the rules in their territory, and they also had the incentive—competition with neighboring lords. As savvy lords tried to foster more prosperity than their neighbors, the many fractal units of feudalism became, in effect, laboratories for non-zero-sumness, competing with each other to raise productivity. This creative tension is what forced rural aristocrats to strike their dangerous bargain with capitalism: fostering the power of the merchant class as an asset in external competition, thus empowering upstart urbanites who might then turn around and challenge aristocratic dominance." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The story of the Middle Ages is the story of new technologies of non-zero-sumness restructuring society in their image. Their upshot ran counter to, and ultimately prevailed over, the generic ambitions of ancient imperial regimes. Once the synergistic power of these technologies crystallized in the form of capitalism, they would allow the entire populace—including descendants of slaves and serfs—to play complex non-zero-sum games with people they would never meet. The bounty would not fall evenly across the populace, but it would fall more evenly than bounty in that part of the world was accustomed to falling. Political power would be more widely diffused than any ancient imperial government had been prepared to contemplate.
>
> This basic drama—the aggrandizing instincts of powerful people versus the decentralizing tendencies of technology, especially information technology—would play out again and again. By that I don’t just mean that free markets would clash recurrently with old regimes, and would win and finally permeate the world (though that seems to be one story line of the past half-millennium). I mean that new information technologies in general—not just money and writing—very often decentralize power, and this fact is not graciously conceded by the powers that be. Hence a certain amount of history’s turbulence, including some in the current era." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "At the end of the Middle Ages, as monolithic China turned inward, Europe was crystallizing into a land of nation-states, and so its contentious dynamism persisted. By their nature, Europeans were just as capable of formulating self-defeating policies as Ming emperors were. It’s just that, in a more immediately competitive environment, someone else was bound to try a better policy, so bad policies came back to haunt you sooner. And once somebody did try a good idea, it could spread to competing polities fast by emulation.
>
> Columbus himself illustrates the point. He sought Portuguese financing, but the king of Portugal turned him down—rather as the Chinese government had decided half a century earlier that long westward voyages weren’t worthwhile. But there was one difference: Portugal, unlike China, had lots of neighbors that were a stone’s throw away. Columbus went to Spain, got support, and came back from the New World triumphant. Within a few years Portugal was playing the discover-America game, too. The “sail westward” meme, having proved its value, proliferated.
>
> As consequential as this meme was, the more important thing, for this book’s purposes, is how memes in general exploited the political landscape of Europe. In this hothouse of interstate competition, technologies of energy, of materials, of information—including algorithms of capitalism and of political governance—were bound to keep sprouting and spreading. For example, patent rights, which helped make initiative worthwhile, were granted in Venice in 1474 and diffused to much of Europe by the middle of the next century.
>
> In this light, Europe’s eventual triumph is not just consistent with a directional theory of cultural evolution; the theory virtually predicts such a triumph. After all, the speed of any evolutionary process depends heavily on two factors: how fast potentially fruitful novelties arise, and how fast manifestly fruitful novelties spread. Europe in the fifteenth century, teeming with competitive but mutually communicative polities, scored higher in both categories than any other part of Eurasia. In such a setting the “sail westward” meme—and profitable memes in general—were (a) likely to take root in one polity or another; and (b) having proved their worth, likely to spread.
>
> ...
>
> All told, if the key to the “European Miracle” lies in geography, it is not so much Europe’s and China’s relative proximity to America as it is Europe’s and China’s political geographies.

Among its errors was imputing to such theories a strict determinism—a belief that every detail of the future could in principle be predicted, that every detail of the present exists by necessity. To read his book, you would think that all who see pattern in history believe, as he put it, that “everything that we do and suffer is part of a fixed pattern.”
>
> The truth is more nearly the opposite. The key to the pattern of history isn’t the fixedness of everything that people do. The key is the pattern’s long-run imperviousness to the lack of fixedness.

The lower the cost of transmitting information, the more broadly and intricately productive a society’s invisible brain can be, both in the short-run sense of everyday economics and the long-run sense of technological advance.

This is truly a trend worth celebrating—especially if you recall the starker concentrations of power that (so far as we can tell) were common in chiefdoms and ancient states.

For example, people persecuted under Hitler were victims “of the historicist superstitions of the Third Reich.” Popper failed to note that by his definition the Enlightenment-era thinkers who founded American democracy, with their progressivist view of history and their attendant sense of mission, harbored “historicist superstitions” as well.

Given the centrality of information technology to non-zero-sumness, and the centrality of non-zero-sumness to social structure, is it possible that we are passing through a true threshold, a change as basic as the transitions from hunter-gatherer village to chiefdom, from chiefdom to ancient state?

By this I don’t mean that savages are savage, barbarians barbaric, and civilized peoples civilized. Indeed, it would be hard to argue that there was net moral gain between the hunter-gatherer and ancient-state phases of cultural evolution.

The point is that the ongoing evolution of information technology heightens this synergy, underscores it, makes it something rulers can less and less afford to ignore.

Among the emerging institutions of world governance that address these particular trust problems are the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund. The WTO rules on trade disputes (much as national courts resolve quarrels between companies, though with less binding authority, at least for now). The International Monetary Fund lends money to troubled nations to prevent panics (the rough global analogue of a nation’s bank deposit insurance) and tries in exchange to get sound management and clean bookkeeping—transparency.

> Still, if what authority these bodies do have exists in response to increasingly non-zero-sum relations among nations, and if technology is very likely to sustain this trend, then it doesn’t take a wild-eyed visionary to imagine more and more authority migrating to the global level. Indeed, the Asian financial crisis, by reminding the world of its interdependence, brought calls for stronger international authority from such non-wild-eyed people as the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. As the New York Times summarized the post-Asia conventional wisdom, “only the most dogmatic free market ideologues think the increasingly integrated global economy can get by without a super-national organization to serve as financial watchdog, scold, mediator and lender of last resort.”
>
> Watchdog, scold, mediator, lender—these don’t sound very forceful. But to be a “lender of last resort”—to lend when the private sector refuses to—is to subsidize, and with subsidy comes power. Indeed, much of the American government’s power over states consists not of legalized coercion, but of strings attached to subsidies. Mainstream plans for post-Asia reforms of the IMF followed this model of government control—a stronger role as lender of last resort, along with tighter strings: more financial disclosure, more fiscal discipline, closer regulation of banking.
>
> As the Asian crisis subsided, the more ambitious of these plans began to fade. Even so, by the spring of 1999, the IMF had voted to set up a permanent “contingent credit line” for emergency use by countries that had met IMF standards of transparency and austerity. Since countries certified as eligible for these bailouts will presumably have an easier time attracting foreign capital, there will be a firm incentive to pass muster. Thus the “contingent credit line,” however tenuous it sounds, may evolve into a systematic extension of IMF power.
>
> And bear in mind that supranational lending institutions, even when their influence is more ad hoc, can seem plenty coercive to nations badly in need of a loan. Here is a sentence from a 1998 issue of the Asian Wall Street Journal: “The World Bank plans to oppose a South Korean government plan to set up a fund to buy equity stakes in troubled companies, probably dooming the proposal.” To the South Koreans, this leverage no doubt felt strikingly like supranational authority.
>
> Also bear in mind that loose organizations which solve non-zero-sum problems have a history of foreshadowing firmer authority. In the nineteenth century, various Italian states harmonized their tariff schedules, deepening economic integration and easing the eventual march toward national political unity. Who knows what could eventually become of the World Trade Organization?
>
> This is in one sense a silly comparison. Economics was hardly the only force at work in nineteenth-century Italy. That other great mixer of non-zero-sum cement, hostility toward an alien power (Austria), played a role. Clearly, such hostility won’t be a factor in the evolution of world governance, assuming any extraterrestrials out there continue to keep their distance.
>
> Indeed, for political conglomeration to take place without war either in the backdrop, as a threat, or front and center, as a reality, would mark a contrast not just with Italian and German history, but with history, period—and, for that matter, with prehistory. As we’ve seen, when social organization moved to the supravillage level of the chiefdom, fighting very often, if not always, figured in. Sometimes the fighting was local, with one village chief conquering the others and thus becoming founder of a chiefdom. But when the merger happened less coercively—as one would hope in the case of world governance—an enemy seems to have loomed outside the chiefdom.
>
> The United States, it is true, moved from a loose confederation to a true nation during peacetime. But it was war that had pushed the states over the threshold to confederation, and the specter of future war figured in the arguments for centralization laid out in the Federalist Papers.

> In short, if space aliens don’t attack the planet, yet it nonetheless moves toward firm supranational governance, the transition will be without known precedent. Still, there are two big reasons not to rule out such an aberration." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "First, nations trade with one another (non-zero-sum game number one). Then they see further gains in mutually lowering tariffs (game number two). Then they decide all would benefit by dampening quarrels over what qualifies as a violation of this agreement, so they set up a way to settle disputes (game number three). Crossing this last threshold—forming an inchoate judiciary—is what turned the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade into the World Trade Organization.
>
> But adjudication entails tricky questions. For example: How do you handle covert trade barriers? When a country makes it illegal to import shrimp caught in nets that kill sea turtles, is that really an environmental law, as advertised, or protectionism in disguise? Both the EU and the WTO weigh in on such matters. Thus did the WTO wind up telling the United States to quit barring shrimp imports from several Asian nations. In theory, the U.S. could have ignored the ruling. All the WTO would have done in response is to approve retaliatory tariffs by aggrieved countries—tariffs those countries could levy even without the WTO’s blessing. Still, the U.S. has benefited from so many WTO rulings that it has a stake in preserving respect for them. This, really, is the whole idea behind governance: the voluntary submission of individual players to an authority that, by solving nonzero-sum problems, can give out in benefits more than it exacts in costs. This net benefit is why WTO rulings may well become more binding, whether through sheer custom or through new law.
>
> As supranational governance greases transborder commerce, more questions arise. If each nation has different food-testing and food-labeling laws, won’t that make life more complicated and expensive for pan-European food producers, and indeed for their customers? Moreover, if each nation has separate food laws, mightn’t they morph into covert trade barriers? Mightn’t French farmers support laws that deem Portuguese food processing substandard, or that define “cheese” so stringently as to keep some imports from carrying that label? All told, then, wouldn’t uniform food laws make things cheaper and simpler for most people? Yes, says the EU (game number four) and thus acquires another function. (And yes, said the United States early in the twentieth century; it was growing interstate commerce that carried such regulatory functions from the state to the federal level.)
>
> As Europe has already shown, the chain of non-zero-sum games needn’t end with regulatory and judicial power. With transnational commerce growing, all those national currencies became a bother. There was the cost of currency exchange and nagging uncertainty about exchange rates. Wouldn’t most Europeans benefit from a single currency? Yes, the EU decided. But one currency meant one central bank. So each nation lost its autonomous central bank and, at a more symbolic level, its currency (or, as they aptly say in Britain, its sovereign). At this point—with nations having surrendered their control of monetary policy—the line between a loose association of nations and an outright confederacy has arguably been crossed.
>
> ...
>
> All in all, the moral of the EU story is: Presto! International trade, via self-regenerating non-zero-sumness, can expand the scope of governance. No extraterrestrials necessary! As technology continues to shorten economic distance, the logical scope of supranational governance could conceivably become the whole planet. This may be hard to imagine now, given the cultural and linguistic diversity of the world and the simmering hostility among some of its peoples. But remember: If ninety, even sixty, years ago, you had predicted that someday France and Germany would have the same currency, the reply would have been: “Oh, really? Which nation will have conquered which?”" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "As it happens, the end of the second millennium has brought the rough equivalent of hostile extraterrestrials—not a single impending assault, but lots of new threats that, together, add up to a big planetary security problem. They range from terrorists (with their menu of increasingly spooky weapons) to a new breed of transnational criminals (many of whom will commit their crimes in that inherently transnational realm, cyberspace) to environmental problems (global warming, ozone depletion, and lots of merely regional but still supranational issues) to health problems (epidemics that exploit modern thoroughfares). None of these things has quite the galvanizing effect of space invaders, but they are all scary, and they all imply supranational governance in one sense or another. They threaten many nations with common perils that are best overcome through cooperation.
>
> The timing is convenient. With economic organization reaching the global level, and governance showing faint signs of doing the same, that great historical congealer of governance—an external enemy—disappears by definition. Meanwhile, a whole slew of nonzero-sum problems arise that are rather like an external enemy; they push people together, to escape common calamity, rather than pulling them together for common gain.
>
> You can already see some of the new structures of governance emerging. They are tenuous, but in their very weakness future strength is visible. Consider the Chemical Weapons Convention. The CWC gives an international body unprecedented power to spring surprise searches on any member state at the behest of any other member state. In 1997, when the U.S. Senate debated the treaty before ratifying it, critics warned about a loss of American sovereignty. In reply, defenders of the convention found themselves in the odd position of stressing its underlying weakness: if the inspectorate tries to search your garage, the American government can stall, and if the search seems unconstitutional, can thwart it. Presumably true. Still, if other countries can do the same, then much of the CWC’s value to the U.S.—the ability to demand inspections in foreign countries—goes down the drain. And if the U.S. wants to realize that value—if it wants other nations to surrender a bit more sovereignty—then it will have to surrender a bit more sovereignty. That’s the way these games work.
>
> The question, then, is whether the value of a stronger inspectorate will ever warrant the price of lost sovereignty. And the answer is almost certainly yes. The spread of technological information—including how to make weapons—has always been unstoppable in the long run, and new media, notably the Internet, are making the long run very short.
>
> Actually, chemical weapons are the least of the problem. On the Richter scale of weapons of mass destruction, they barely register. It is biological and nuclear weapons that ensure that by 2020 any well-funded terrorist group will have the know-how to kill 50,000 people in any given city.
>
> Biological weapons are much easier to make and to hide than nuclear weapons. The encroachment on sovereignty that they will call for is, to current sensibilities, shocking. All kinds of industrial and medical facilities will have to be monitored. The personal possession of some equipment will probably have to be banned, and surprise inspections will be necessary. This prospect—that some supranational agency could demand to search your basement or your kitchen freezer—would now strike most Americans as unthinkable, even if local police were in tow to guard against abuse.
>
> But trauma has a way of making the unthinkable widely thought. In the middle of World War II, the historian Arnold Toynbee met with a number of notables in Princeton, New Jersey, to discuss the postwar world. By the end of the meeting, Toynbee had convinced John Foster Dulles—a temperamentally conservative man who would later become secretary of state in a Republican administration—that world government was essential. Dulles signed on to the group’s conclusion that “as Christians we must proclaim the moral consequences of the factual interdependence to which the world has come. The world has become a community, and its constituent members no longer have the moral right to exercise ‘sovereignty’ or ‘independence’ which is now no more than a legal right to act without regard to the harm which is done to others.”
>
> ...
>
> Lots of non-zero-sum problems show the same logic: basic technological trends make their growth all but certain, and their eventual solution will likely entail real accretions of supranational governance. Global laws on the prescription of antibiotics? Sure, if their too-casual use creates strains of super-bacteria that can cross oceans on any airplane. Limits on each nation’s saltwater fish harvest, complete with random inspections of any fishing boat and stiff penalties? Sure, as the oceans thin out. An International Monetary Fund whose regulatory powers approach those that national governments now possess? Quite possibly, in the wake of a global depression.
>
> And then, of course, there is that notorious sovereignty-sapper, cyberspace, which empowers offshore tax evaders, offshore info-terrorists, offshore copyright violators, offshore libelers. (And sometimes the culprit may be on-shore, using an offshore computer.) Nations will find it harder and harder to enforce more and more laws unless they coordinate law enforcement and, in some cases, the laws themselves.
>
> Viewed separately, the various layers of supranational governance may not seem momentous. But they add up. We can’t predict for sure which problems will find strong supranational solution, but a broader prediction is possible: as technological evolution keeps doing what it has always done—expand and deepen non-zero-sumness—much supranational governance will be in order.
>
> In the end, then, the “chaos” and “order” scenarios find a kind of reconciliation. Whole new species of chaos will indeed arise, but they will drive the world to a new level of political organization that, if it works, will bring order. What the “chaos” theorists fail to see is that chaos is just a non-zero-sum problem, something people are good at solving." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Will the World Trade Organization ever go the way of the European Union? Will qualifying for membership someday entail more than low tariffs? Child-labor laws? Workplace-safety laws? Right-to-organize laws? And what about environmental law? Might adherence to global environmental treaties become part of staying a member in good standing of the WTO?
>
> None of this is unthinkable, especially if the American left—and the left in other nations—make such changes a condition for accepting WTO amendments that big business supports. We may well someday see workers of the world truly uniting, like environmentalists of the world. The old political debates will continue—How to balance economic equality with efficiency?—but they will be mediated by supranational bodies of governance, whether regional or global.
>
> ...
>
> Note the pattern: Again and again, supranational “tribes”—environmental groups, labor groups, human rights groups, trade groups, multinational corporations—abet order, not chaos. Their narrow but long reach moves law and regulation toward global harmony. These different tribes don’t stand in paradoxical contrast to globalization, any more than myriad kinds of cells stand in paradoxical contrast to the larger organism they constitute. In both cases, the fine-grained diversity is integral. The body politic couldn’t reach the global level if interest groups didn’t get there. To say that social complexity grows in depth and scope is to say that division of labor, including division of political labor, grows more fine-grained yet of broader reach. In that sense, supranational “tribalism” is a natural outgrowth of the whole history of humankind." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "This new support for supranational rules was based largely on growing economic interdependence, which made war more and more a lose-lose game. Indeed, war was not just a lose-lose game, but a lose-lose-lose game—bad for the warriors, but also, increasingly, bad for their neighbors. Kant had seen this logic beginning to unfold back in the late eighteenth century, and had extrapolated from it ambitiously: “The effects which an upheaval in any state produces upon all the others in our continent, where all are so closely linked by trade, are so perceptible that these other states are forced by their own insecurity to offer themselves as arbiters, albeit without legal authority, so that they indirectly prepare the way for a great political body of the future, without precedent in the past.”" - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "“Great political body” number three—the United Nations—is the most ambitious one yet. God knows it hasn’t done quite the job of preserving peace that idealists envisioned. But it has had more glimmers of success than the League of Nations, and has already lived twice as long as the league.
>
> Moreover, expanding non-zero-sumness has in the meanwhile carried the rationale for supranational governance well beyond peacekeeping. Everything from tax policy to accounting standards to environmental policy to policing power is creeping toward the supranational level.
>
> Whether the eventual result will be a single “world government,” as woolly-minded one-worlders have long dreamed, is anybody’s guess. Another possibility, and perhaps a more benign one, is lots of overlapping bodies—some regional, some global; some economic, some environmental; some comprising national governments, some comprising non-state actors; and so on. An intermediate possibility is that these sorts of bodies would fall loosely under the auspices of the United Nations (as many inchoate bodies now do).
>
> All kinds of scenarios are imaginable. What is hard to imagine is that this migration of governance beyond national bounds will stop before turning nation-states into something rather like provinces. The migration is driven by clear technological trends that are millennia-old and show no signs of abating: advances in technology—information, transportation, military, and so on—that make relations among polities more non-zero-sum. This logic will draw “tribes” into the New World Order even as they fiercely assert their independence from an old order." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "In many developed nations, the drift toward world governance is drawing fire. The nation-state, nationalists complain, is sacrificing its sovereignty. This is true; governmental structures—including supranational ones—always lessen the freedom of their constituents. But at the same time, governmental structures expand freedom. If a city’s government is functioning well, its citizens gain the freedom to walk the streets with little fear of assault. Part of the deal, though, is that they don’t have the freedom to assault other citizens. If you like the idea of government, that means you cherish freedom from assault more than freedom to assault.
>
> So it is with supranational governance. Would you like to be reasonably free of the fear of a global depression? Or would you rather preserve your nation’s freedom to raise tariffs at will, or to keep its financial institutions opaque to international view? Do you cherish the freedom to live without fear of dying in a biological weapons attack? Or do you prefer the freedom to live without fear of having your freezer searched for anthrax by an international inspectorate in the unlikely event that evidence casts suspicion in your direction?
>
> Or, to turn such questions inside out: Which sort of sovereignty would you rather lose? Sovereignty over your freezer, or sovereignty over your life?
>
> The loss of sovereignty isn’t some novelty dreamed up by bureaucrats at the UN or the WTO. If we define sovereignty broadly—as supreme control over your fate—then the loss of sovereignty is a fact of history, one of the most fundamental, stubborn facts in all of history. Indeed, to observe that history has eroded sovereignty time and again is simply to restate the thesis of this book: that history has elevated non-zero-sumness time and again. For to say that you have been cast into a non-zero-sum situation is to say that you have lost unilateral control over your future—that your destiny has to some extent been taken out of your hands and spread among other people, just as part of their destiny now rests in your hands. Both you and they can regain some measure of that control, some portion of that lost sovereignty, but only through cooperation—a cooperation that involves sacrifices of control, of sovereignty, in its own right. The question is never whether you can keep all of your sovereignty; history says you can’t; all along it has been the fate of humankind to have its fate increasingly shared. The question is in what form you want to lose your sovereignty." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The early-twentieth-century sociologist William Ogburn attributed many of the world’s problems to “cultural lag.” Cultural lag happens when material culture (technology, basically) changes so fast that nonmaterial culture (including governance and social norms) has trouble catching up. In short, the disruptive part of culture gets out ahead of what Ogburn called the “adaptive” part of culture. Ogburn’s general prescription was to speed up the latter—“make the cultural adjustments as quickly as possible.” But there is another option: slow down the former—cut the rate at which material technology is transforming the world; make the inevitable unfold at a more sedate pace.
>
> Of course, it isn’t that easy. Globalization doesn’t come with a velocity-control knob. And the old-fashioned approach to slowing the spread of material technology—raising tariffs—has a history of inviting retaliation and thus yielding full-blown trade wars (the kind that usher in depressions). But there is a safer approach to slowing globalization down just a tad—a supranational approach.
>
> The idea isn’t to create a Bureau of Global Slowdown at the United Nations. The idea is simply to tolerate various supranational efforts that are starting to take shape and that, as they solidify, will naturally have a sedative effect. As first-world and third-world workers unite to raise third-world wages (and thus keep first-world wages from free-falling), industrialists will complain that this dulls the market’s edge, slowing progress. Yes, it does—but that’s okay. As environmentalists unite to save rain forests, or tax fossil fuels, the same complaint will be heard—and the same answer will apply. In the age of the superempowered angry man, and the quite disgruntled man, the slowing down of deeply unsettling change is a benefit, not just a cost, because anger and disgruntlement are world-class problems.
>
> Note that these two particular forms of slowdown—supranational labor and environmental policies—have the added virtue of directly addressing specific sources of anger and disgruntlement: the rapid exodus of blue-collar jobs from developed nations; and the ecological damage that can radicalize environmentalists and that, more broadly, deepens cultural dislocation in such already polluted places as Mexico City and Bangkok. In a sense, then, these policies address both halves of the “cultural lag.” Rather than choose between slowing the “material” change and hastening the “adaptive” change, we can slow the material change by hastening the adaptive change.
>
> In a way, it’s a misnomer to call this a “slowing” of globalization. After all, the things that might do the slowing—supranational labor groups or environmental groups, supranational bodies of governance—are themselves part of globalization. What is really happening is that the further evolution of political globalization is slightly slowing the evolution of economic globalization.
>
> This approach has a proven track record. In the United States during the early twentieth century, as economic activity migrated from the state level to the national level, the national government grew powerful enough to regulate it. And some of the regulation—labor laws in particular—had the effect of subduing capitalism a bit, dulling its harsher edges. This was, among other things, a preemptive strike against chaos (in the form of Marxist revolution) and a successful one.
>
> We needn’t worry much about economic globalization grinding to a halt under the weight of regulation. The political prerequisites for real regulation, such as strong transnational labor coalitions, will form only slowly, and the economic impetus behind globalization is mammoth. In fact, the only thing with much chance of stalling globalization for any length of time is the very chaotic backlash—from the angry and the disgruntled—that a slight slowdown might avert. Strange as it sounds, the best way to keep economic globalization from slowing down a lot may be to slow it down a little." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Hence a creepy irony of the coming world: even though information technology’s basic drift in recent centuries has been to expand freedom—to bring political pluralism to more and more nations—it can, at another level, shrink freedom. As the world comes to resemble a giant superorganism, with a fiber-optic nervous system, we could come to identify with Winston Smith, who, in Orwell’s 1984, is asked by a totalitarian goon: “Can you not understand, Winston, that the individual is only a cell?” But, unlike Smith, we’ll have chosen the life of a cell.

>
> Well, at the risk of sounding cold-hearted: they’ve outlived their usefulness. From the beginning their value was of an ironic sort. Enmity drove society toward larger expanses of amity. Greed and the lust for status, for power over people, helped drive a technological evolution that granted people more freedom. All along, the darker side of human nature was defensible, if at all, only to the extent that it tended to thus negate its own values system. And, all along, there was the implied prospect that, in the end, if the darker side’s downside grew and its upside waned, defending it would get hard.

> The end is here. With the world’s ecosystem already under stress, and billions of additional people apparently on the way, mindless materialism grows more dubious. With society finally globalized, we don’t need war to push political organization (that is, the realm of peace) to broader expanse. And with nuclear and biological weapons at hand, full-fledged war—and for that matter full-fledged terrorism—are less palatable than ever. Hatred just isn’t what it used to be.

He wrote: “From war has been gained all that it had to give….” The social evolution that “had to be achieved through the conflicts of societies with one another, has already been achieved; and no further benefits are to be looked for.” Wars, he observed, had not only ceased to be vital to progress; increasingly, they were the cause of “retrogression.” (And this was before nuclear weapons.)

> "There is one further analogy between organisms and societies. It isn’t just that in both cases energy is marshaled in a way that sustains and protects structure. And it isn’t just that this marshaling is always guided by information. It is that it is the function of the information to guide the marshaling. The inter-cellular and intra-cellular messenger systems involved in fingernail or bone construction evolved to guide such construction; they were preserved by natural selection because they helped preserve the core of life’s structure, the DNA. And the same is true of the information-processing system that governs the construction of huts and temples and skyscrapers, and the maintenance of corporations and armies.

No. For one thing, there are a few fairly daunting evolutionary thresholds that had to get crossed somewhere between a well-designed bacterium and Homo sapiens.

Whether you are a bunch of genes or a bunch of memes, if you’re all in the same boat you’ll tend to perish unless you are conducive to productive coordination. For genes, the boat tends to be a cell or a multicelled organism or occasionally, as we’ll see shortly, a looser grouping, such as a family; for memes, the boat is often a larger social group—a village, a chiefdom, a state, a religious denomination, Boy Scouts of America, whatever. Genetic evolution thus tends to create smoothly integrated organisms, and cultural evolution tends to create smoothly integrated groups of organisms." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Biological evolution, like cultural evolution, creates opportunities for cheaters—pirates and scoundrels who would parasitically subvert the greater good if left to their own devices. So natural selection designs technologies of “trust”—anti-cheating mechanisms.
>
> For example, we’ve seen that the cells in your body get along famously in large part because they are genetically identical. But suppose that, while your cells are dividing after birth, a mutation happens. A new, genetically distinct type of cell is born. Rather than focus on serving the needs of the larger organism, it replicates itself manically. By the time you are old enough to reproduce, there are so many of these mutant cells that they stand a much better than average chance of getting their DNA into the next generation.
>
> In theory, such a cell would be favored by natural selection—at least, in the short run. But in real life, this sort of parasitism couldn’t happen. The reason is that back when you were very, very, very young, your “germ line” was “sequestered.” That is, the cells that will form your egg or sperm were put aside for safekeeping; try as some mutant skin cell might, it will never get into the next generation, no matter how prolific it is.
>
> Why do animals thus seclude their germ lines? In the view of some biologists, it is precisely to avoid this sort of parasitic mutiny; germ-line sequestration is an anti-cheating device—the functional equivalent of a technology of trust. It presumably evolved as organisms that lacked such a technology died out, their coherence compromised by rampant cheating—rather as human cultures are extinguished if they fail to discourage the sorts of parasitism to which humans are prone." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "The same thing happens in other species: chimpanzees, dolphins, even people. As noted in chapter 2, people, though smart enough to pursue non-zero-sum gain without specific prompting from their genes, do in fact get prompted. Generosity, gratitude, and outrage over ingratitude are genetically based impulses that can steer us into mutually profitable relationships and away from unprofitable ones. There is also a genetically based impulse that sometimes keeps us in profitable relationships—affection, an affection that, in the deepest friendships, can approach outright love. If kin selection can be credited with inventing affection, reciprocal altruism gets credit for extending affection beyond kin. And what gets credit for both feats is non-zero-sumness, the logic shared by these two evolutionary dynamics. Non-zero-sumness, in addition to being the reason that organic complexity exists, and the reason communication got invented, is the reason there is love." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "In biological evolution, as in cultural evolution, Kant’s “unsocial sociability” is a recurring theme. Indeed, “unsociality”—that’s a polite way of putting it, actually—is central to natural selection: organisms vie for finite resources, and the losers slip from the pages of history. And the “slipping” assumes such forms as starvation, disease, and getting devoured. Natural selection creates by discarding, and it doesn’t discard gently." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Did basic properties of natural selection make it very likely that someday some animal would be smart enough to invent neat gadgets? And figure out that the earth revolves around the sun? And ponder the mind-body problem? Does biological evolution intrinsically favor the growth of biological complexity—including behavioral flexibility, and its underpinning, intelligence? Is this biological “progress” somehow natural?
>
> It has long been unfashionable to answer yes. One big reason is the same big reason that made belief in directional cultural evolution so unfashionable: past political misuse.
>
> Early this century, biological progressivism was dear to the hearts of “social Darwinists,” who used it to justify things like racism, imperialism, and laissez-faire indifference to poverty. The logic behind social Darwinism—to the extent that it had a coherent logic—was something like the following: The suffering, even death, of the weak at the hands of the strong is an example of “survival of the fittest.” And the “survival of the fittest” has God’s blessing. And how do we know that the “survival of the fittest” has God’s blessing? Because He built the dynamic into His great creative process, natural selection. And how do we know that natural selection is God’s handiwork? Because of its inexorable tendency to create organisms as majestic as ourselves, organisms worthy of admission to heaven! In short, biological progressivism was used to deify nature in all its aspects, and nature, thus deified, was invoked in support of oppression.

> Again, as with Gould’s emphasis on stagnant “modal” complexity, one might ask how much this argument really matters for philosophical purposes. The question behind this whole exercise, remember, is whether the evolution of something as smart and complex as us was very likely. If the combination of a “random walk” and a “wall of zero complexity” leads people to conclude that the answer is yes, then, well, their answer is yes. If, as Gould fears, people are inclined to take a “yes” answer as evidence of higher purpose, they probably aren’t going to be too picky about the exact type of “yes.” God, they will say, works in strange and wondrous ways.
>
> Still, the more factors favoring the evolution of complexity, the more irresistible the “yes” answer is—the more likely evolution was to eventually reach a human level of intelligence. So it’s worth seeing if Gould is somehow overlooking “non-random” factors that are conducive to complexity. He is.

> "The kind of God that is hardest to find evidence of is the kind most people seem to believe in: a God that is infinitely powerful and infinitely good. After all, presumably that kind of God wouldn’t have let Pol Pot happen—and wouldn’t allow the various other forms of cruelty and suffering in the world (including those inherent in organic evolution, and thus in our creation). This is not, of course, some new insight that emerges from this book’s vantage point. It is a very old insight—“the problem of evil”—that emerges from the most casual inspection of the everyday world: Why would a benign, almighty God let bad things happen to good people—or to people in general?
>
> Some thinkers have solved the problem of evil straightforwardly, by denying its premise. Ancient Zoroastrians said God is not omnipotent, but rather is in pitched battle with an evil spirit, and is doing His best. More often, theologians have finessed the issue: God is good and omnipotent, so all the seemingly bad things He tolerates must have redeeming qualities that make them ultimately good. For example, maybe suffering is a prerequisite for “soul building.”
>
> This argument has often drawn the obvious rejoinder: If God is omnipotent, why doesn’t He rewire the universe so that suffering isn’t necessary for “soul building”? What would be wrong with prefab souls?
>
> Personally, I prefer the Zoroastrian scenario. Or, perhaps, a scenario in which a good God, though not confronting an active, satanic force, is in some other sense of limited power.

> "My point is just that these brains are a continuous outgrowth of something at life’s very essence: a primordial imperative to process information. Given the apparent connection among information processing, sentience, and meaning, it seems fair to say that evolution by natural selection was from the beginning a veritable machine for making meaning.
>
> As we’ve seen, the logic by which complexity, hence data processing, hence meaning, grows is the logic of non-zero-sumness. The genes along a strand of DNA have a non-zero-sum relationship with one another, as do the organelles within a cell, the cells within a body. In all of these cases, the cause of the non-zero-sumness is shared Darwinian interest—being in the same boat in one sense or another—and the result is transmitted information. For, as noted in chapter 8, the successful playing of non-zero-sum games—cooperative coordination—generally involves communication.
>
> Within any organism, it is these well-played non-zero-sum games, and the flexible coherence they bring, that let life persist in the face of mounting universal entropy; that let life defy the spirit, though not the letter, of the second law of thermodynamics. That games which call for information processing should be on the leading edge of this war against entropy makes perfect sense. As Jacques Monod observed (in chapter 17), to arrange matter into an orderly form and keep it there, in the face of the second law’s tendency to mix things up, requires a “discriminative,” even “cognitive” capacity. Ever since life’s initial defiance of the spirit of the second law, information processing has risen to higher and higher levels, following the logic of organic coherence, which is to say, the logic of non-zero-sumness." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "On the other hand, isn’t goodness a slightly naive thing to ask of an architect whose plans included natural selection? At its core, natural selection is cutthroat. It is a zero-sum struggle for finite resources, and there are no rules. How much good could come of that?
>
> More than you might think. As we’ve seen, this dynamic had the paradoxical effect of weaving ever-larger non-zero-sum webs, from a single strand of DNA all the way up to a society of multicellular animals. The point isn’t just the attendant growth in data processing, hence sentience, hence meaning. Eventually, this dynamic brought some semblance of actual good. For, when the impetus of non-zero-sumness finally reached the level of animal societies, it entailed—as we saw in chapter 18—the invention and proliferation of love.
>
> Actually, “entailed” is a bit strong. What this impetus clearly entailed wasn’t love per se, but the evolution of altruistic behavior among close kin. This altruistic behavior in turn seems to have en-tailed—for reasons concealed in the more general mystery of consciousness—the subjective experience of love. (At least, in our species, love is what parents feel when they nurture and protect their offspring, and there’s no reason to think chimps or dogs are any different.) Anyway, the main point is that with the advent of altruism, animals were doing something other than eat each other; they were helping each other, and feeling good about it to boot.
>
> Intra-family altruism has evolved multiple times, and naturally so. With closely related organisms tending to start out life near each other, commonality of Darwinian interest is thick, just waiting to be harnessed by the logic of kin selection. Though maternal devotion was presumably the original form of kin-directed love (even many insects display maternal altruism), other forms followed: sibling love and—in our species and some others—paternal love.
>
> Altruism, having established a beachhead within the family, eventually branched out beyond close relatives. As we’ve seen, in a number of species, including ours, natural selection invented reciprocal altruism, which, notwithstanding its underlying cold calculation, involves heartfelt obligation, even affection. This tendency of human beings to form bonds beyond the family would become crucial as cultural evolution began the long geographic expansion of non-zero-sumness. Biological evolution, having created goodness by inventing altruism, would now surrender center stage to the second great evolutionary force, with which any hopes for expanding goodness would now lie.
>
> But before we get too rhapsodic about all this bonding, a word is in order about affection’s oft-underplayed downside. Ever hear of the “Texas cheerleader mom”? She was convicted of plotting to murder her daughter’s rival for a high-school cheerleading slot. The good news is that this woman is manifestly not typical of mothers in Texas—or anywhere. The bad news is that she nonetheless illustrates, if in grotesque proportion, a ubiquitous point: love is, by design, an invidious emotion. The problem isn’t just that love gets extended selectively, often coming to a screeching halt at the bounds of family. The problem is that love is often deployed to the active detriment of people beyond the family. It’s a jungle out there, after all, and we want our loved ones to triumph.
>
> This seamy underside of affinity isn’t confined to intra-family affinity. One common purpose of reciprocal altruism in primates is to cement coalitions which then compete with other coalitions, sometimes violently. In general, as the biologist Richard Alexander has observed, the flip side of “within-group amity” is “between-group enmity.”
>
> This dour equation seems almost to have been a constant of human history. Lengthened and strengthened bonds have tended to involve deepened fissures. Consider those nostalgic reveries about wartime. Soldiers talk about the indelible devotion to their comrades in arms, and civilians recall the sense of brotherhood that suffused a whole nation. Sounds great. But as amity thus reached national scope, the petty enmities of daily life weren’t so much erased as displaced—piled up, sky-high, along the nation’s border: a mass of hatred between peoples. It almost seems as if one of the basic laws of the universe, right next to “conservation of mass” and “conservation of energy,” is “conservation of antipathy.”
>
> Here again we encounter the problem of evil: you wouldn’t expect a benign and omnipotent God to embed such a law in the universe. Yet the law—or, at least, the “law”—does seem fundamental. It is grounded in the basic paradox of creation: non-zero-sumness, wondrous though it is, was created by, and for, zero-sumness, and is thus naturally prone to malicious use. Kant’s “unsocial sociability” lies in the very logic of natural selection." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "Is “conservation of antipathy” truly a law of nature—or, at least, a rough tendency so deeply embedded in human affairs as to doom moral progress?
>
> No, for two reasons. First, martial fervor is not the only source of social bonding. If I water my neighbor’s plants while he’s away, and he returns the favor, our mutual amity grows just a bit—without any necessary growth in my dislike of anyone else. And much of the growth of non-zero-sumness over the past few millennia has been of this sort—people being “pulled” together for common gain, not “pushed” together by a common enemy.
>
> One of the main pulling forces, of course, has been economic. Granted, commerce can be a cool affair, and often fails to expand the web of affection, but it does expand the web of tolerance. You don’t have to love your grocer, but you shouldn’t assault him. You don’t have to love the people who built your Toyota, but it’s unwise to bomb them—just as it’s unwise to bomb the people overseas who are buying the things you made.
>
> The second reason that the alleged “conservation of antipathy” doesn’t doom moral progress has to do not with these “pulling” forces of economics but with the “pushing” forces, under which people unite to thwart a common threat. Though war is the time-honored example of such a force, we saw in chapter 15 how things can change as social organization approaches the global level. At that point, barring extraterrestrial invasion, conquest isn’t the peril that brings people together. Rather, they cooperate to evade such things as terrorism, international crime, environmental calamity, and economic collapse. More than before, non-zero-sumness can thrive without zero-sumness as its ultimate source. To whatever rough extent “conservation of antipathy” has held as a general law of history, it seems to be in the process of being repealed.
>
> Of course, zero-sumness hasn’t vanished. Corporations compete with corporations, politicians compete with politicians, soccer teams compete with soccer teams. What’s more, some of the new sources of common peril—terrorists and international criminals—are playing emphatically zero-sum games: they have interests quite opposed to those of society at large, and will accordingly inspire their share of antipathy. Still, as non-zero-sumness has grown, finally reaching global extent, a particular kind of zero-sum dynamic has begun to weaken. And it is the most pernicious kind: bitter struggle between geographically separate groups, featuring blind hatred of whole peoples. The spatial dimension of zero-sumness, historically its most abhorrent dimension, has begun to fade. In this sense—a limited but far from trivial sense—we can say that non-zero-sumness is on the verge of having “won” in the end." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "One can well imagine, as the Internet nurtures more and more communities of interest, true friendships more and more crossing the most dangerous fault lines—boundaries of religion, of nationality, of ethnicity, of culture.
>
> The common interests that support these friendships needn’t be high in gravitas. They can range from stopping ozone depletion to preserving Gaelic folklore to stamp collecting to playing online chess. The main thing is that they be far-flung and cross-cutting. Maybe this is the most ambitious realistic hope for the future expansion of amity—a world in which just about everyone holds allegiance to enough different groups, with enough different kinds of people, so that plain old-fashioned bigotry would entail discomfiting cognitive dissonance. It isn’t that everyone will love everyone, but rather that everyone will like enough different kinds of people to make hating any given type problematic. Maybe Teilhard’s mistake was to always use “noosphere” in the singular, never in the plural. Maybe the world of tomorrow will be a collage of noospheres with enough overlap to vastly complicate the geography of hatred. It wouldn’t be Point Omega, but it would be progress." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

> "One might hope that moral progress will get a boost from the further evolution of the world’s spiritual traditions. Certainly, in the past, religious doctrine has offered an expanding spiritual basis for the technologically driven expansion of non-zero-sumness. The growth of Islam more than a millennium ago not only created a network of Muslim traders who could trust one another; by preaching tolerance of Christians and Jews—“people of the Book”—Islamic scripture smoothed the path of commerce all the more.
>
> Judeo-Christian doctrine was similarly pragmatic in its evolution. It is easy to miss the continuity here—to see an abrupt shift between the Old Testament, with its wrathful, tribalistic God, and the New Testament, with its universally loving God. Indeed, in early Christian times, some thinkers—such as Marcion, in the second century—used this dichotomy to solve the problem of evil: the God of the Old Testament, the creator of life, was an evil god, and the God of the New Testament, the God of love, had now come to help us make the best of a bad situation. But the truth is that even in the Old Testament, God can be seen turning into a nicer guy. In the millennium before Christ arrived, as commerce drew distant lands into deeper contact (thanks partly to the debut of coins), the scope of God’s sympathy grew. In two books composed in the second half of the millennium—Jonah and Ruth—God’s love reaches beyond tribal bounds, to gentiles." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

>
> In effect, as cultural evolution has progressed, the size of society writ large—the number of people with whom one’s fortunes are intertwined, with whom one does well to do right—has grown. And one role of religious doctrine has always been to congeal societies. (The word “religion” comes from the Latin ligare, “to bind.”) Émile Durkheim went so far as to say that “the idea of society is the soul of religion.” Depending on how it is put, the point can sound a little dispiriting—as when Durkheim wrote: “In the last analysis men have never worshipped anything other than their own society.” Still, if worshiping your own society finally, in a global age, involves not denigrating other peoples but, rather, recognizing the moral worth of human beings everywhere, then there is something to be said for worshiping your own society. The equation between doing well and doing right may sound crass, but if, over tens of millennia of cultural evolution, it brings moral enlightenment, then my hat is off to it." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

At the same time, there is the prospect of building the infrastructure for a planetary first: enduring global concord.

> And if we did that—if we laid a foundation for peace and fulfillment around the world—that would counterbalance a lot of past evils, given the number of people now around to enjoy the benefits. It may literally be within the power of our species to swing nature’s moral scales—which for so long tended to equilibrate near dead even, at best—decisively in the direction of good; maybe it is up to us, having inherited only the most ambiguous evidence of divinity, to construct clearer evidence in the future. Maybe history is, as various thinkers have suggested, not so much the product of divinity as the realization of divinity—assuming our species is up to the challenge, that is. (One theologian has paraphrased Teilhard as believing that “God must become for us less Alpha than Omega.”)

However close to inevitable stable world governance may be in the long run, here and now we are playing for the highest stakes that have ever been played for, and winning will depend in no small part on continued moral growth.

> "A non-zero-sum relationship is not a relationship in which cooperation is necessarily taking place. It is (usually) a relationship in which, if cooperation did take place, it would benefit both parties. Whether the cooperation does take place—whether the parties realize positive sums—is another matter. And, aside from “non-zero-sum,” I can’t think of a word that captures this relationship. To call it a relationship in which “self-interest rationally pursued could lead to cooperation” just isn’t very economical. Even a relationship “conducive to cooperation” isn’t very economical, and is vague, even misleading, to boot.

> Non-zero-sumness is a kind of potential. Like what physicists call “potential energy,” it can be tapped or not tapped, depending on how people behave. But there’s a difference. When you tap potential energy—when you, say, nudge a bowling ball off a cliff—you’ve reduced the amount of potential energy in the world. Non-zero-sumness, in contrast, is self-regenerating. To realize non-zero-sumness—to turn the potential into positive sums—often creates even more potential, more non-zero-sumness. That is the reason that the world once boasted only a handful of bacteria and today features IBM, Coca-Cola, and the United Nations." - [Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, by Robert Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero)

And in these kinds of situations, typically, there does need to be explicit communication (however circuitous), and there do need to be explicit means of sustaining trust. Hence the importance of evolving information technology in expanding the scope and complexity of social organization.

> "Culture is not just something we passively experience, but also something we actively influence. The sociological categories themselves are thus, in a real way, up for re-conception and re-invention. Government, economics, education, and yes, even religion are social structures and systems whose parameters should not be taken as immutable givens but, within reason, and subject to constraints, be up for redesign. Jamie Wheal calls such work “culture architecture.” I tend to think of it as “civilizational design,” wherein culture-artists develop new ways of living and being for a world so urgently in need of new possibilities." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "While only 10 years ago it would have sounded utterly preposterous to be talking in terms of architecting new religions and co-creating worldviews, today these sorts of projects are at the cutting edge of systems change activism and civilizational design. More and more, people are realizing that to fix the unimaginably knotty problems our society faces requires intervention at levels never before imagined. Fortunately, as our problems become more profound, so does the leading edge of our thought, so that even as we grapple with the prospect of global civilizational breakdown and climatological catastrophe, we also have the conceptual tools to develop new spiritual frameworks and even whole worldviews that can meet these existential challenges head-on." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "So, what is Emergentism, exactly? Well, let’s start with the name. The concept of “emergence” and “emergent properties” has become crucial to the new science I have been referring to—nowadays known simply as “complexity science.” The basic idea is that, as things become more and more complex, completely novel and unpredictable phenomena arise—entirely new layers of reality, in fact, which behave according to their own laws and principles. These new levels are said to “emerge” out of interactions occurring lower down, and so possess their own unique “emergent properties” not reducible to their parts." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "According to the cosmology of the new science, consciousness itself is what has been breaking forth from its concealment in mere matter. The evolution of the cosmos has been unfolding so as to bring forth self-awareness and self-knowledge. The universe itself is waking up—including waking up to this very realization (through us). For we are that consciousness." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "A worldview with a broken sense of how parts relate to wholes can break our relationship to the whole world. And isn’t that precisely what has happened?
>
> Consider, for instance, that meaning itself is a whole-part relationship. For something to have meaning, it must be a means—that is, it must exist for something else, as a means to something else. It must have a causal significance, we would say, in something “bigger” than itself.
>
> ...
>
> If, then, our sense of the relationship between parts and wholes becomes corrupted, we are at risk of losing our very sense of meaning itself—just as, in fact, we have done. We have become parts without a whole, at the same time that we cannot even claim to be whole ourselves." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The world, we all know, is immensely complex. The word “complex” comes from Latin and means “woven together.” And that is indeed an apt metaphor, since all you have to do is look around you to see the countless varied phenomena endlessly interacting, intermingling, and interrelating in infinite combinations." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This is how we’ve come to use rationality to analyze the world. The word “analyze” means, literally, “to break apart.” By breaking the world into its parts and assessing each one in isolation, the early modern scientists hoped to gain an understanding of how the whole loaf of reality works.
>
> And, in countless crucial ways, they did! The astonishing triumph of modern science (as well as its limiting weakness, as we’ll see) lay in this: its isolation of the part from the whole." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Everything could—or would—be explained by simple material part-icles in motion: a metaphysical framework known as materialism.
>
> Thus, with the triumph of reductionism, the entire religious edifice of tradition cracked, its metaphysical Great Chain and cosmic story rapidly eroding. In its place was modernity’s new worldview—with its own metaphysics and unnerving new narrative.
>
> This metaphysical framework was valueless. The hierarchy of reality was not organized by good and evil, only size—and the smallest parts were the most important. There was no personal God, only deterministic laws that govern the universe—and these were as indifferent to humans’ existential lot as any machine. Whatever could not be described in terms of fundamental particles in motion was either a fiction or an illusion.
>
> The cosmic story of this worldview was, as a consequence, radically different from that of traditional religion. Having stripped a benevolent God of any causal power, there was no providential “creation” per se; the universe just was (and presumably always was; or, if it did have a beginning, arose from chance).
>
> There was no divine drama or omniscient Plan. Human beings, and all life, were essentially just complicated machines, governed not by their agency but by their constituent parts following deterministic paths through space. And just as there is no meaning to turning gears or pumps, neither is there any meaning, ultimately, to human life.
>
> In this way, it should be clear that reductionism was what first sowed the seeds of our contemporary meaning crisis. With the rise of modern reductionistic science, humanity’s role in a divine saga was lost, and the perceived whole of conscious human life itself was reduced to its smallest parts—where one no longer finds any meaning, only law.
>
> This idea continues to reverberate and resonate today. Millions of despairing souls still believe it—and it is driving them to the nihilistic conclusions nascent in it. Until, at last, here we are: We have become parts without a whole, at the same time that we cannot even claim to be whole ourselves.
>
> Our lives lack the larger context of a cosmic story in which we play an important causal role. Nor can we even claim to be genuine agents with volitional integrity, since our wills and even our conscious awareness itself are merely “epi-phenomenal” illusions: vestigial byproducts of particles acting in deterministic fashion deeper down." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "But things become more problematic with the second law, likewise deduced from observation, which says that the total energy in the system will gradually and irrevocably dissipate until a homogenous equilibrium state is reached. Differences even out, distinctions blur, and gradients are eradicated over time.
>
> Think what happens when you add hot water to a thermos of cold water. That energetic hot water won’t stay all clumped together in one place; instead, the heat will spread out (or “dissipate”) until all the water in the thermos finally becomes one uniform temperature. This is called “entropy,” and the second law asserts that free energy is always being entropically dissipated over time—degraded, you could say, until eventually it’s totally useless and the system reaches a uniform, featureless balance: equilibrium.
>
> This insight created a big problem for the conception of Newtonian reality as particles in motion whose future and past states could all be predicted with deterministic certitude. Instead of being able to deduce it, once something reaches equilibrium it’s impossible to know its earlier state (AKA its “initial conditions”). You can’t deduce from a warm thermos that there was ever hot water of a certain temperature added to cold water of a certain temperature; all of that information is lost once the temperatures mix due to entropy.
>
> The laws of Newtonian physics were completely reversible. Gravity might bring a rock down, but enough force against gravity could throw a rock right back up again. The laws of thermodynamics, by contrast, had a clear irreversible trajectory. The hot and cold water will mix spontaneously over time, but trying to separate them again requires a lot of energy—free energy that no longer exists in the system, precisely because it’s been dissipated.
>
> In short, according to Newton’s laws, time was negligible; according to the laws of thermodynamics, however, time has a clear direction. It gives us what Arthur Eddington famously called the “arrow of time.” And, according to the laws of thermodynamics, that arrow seemed to move only one way: from a gradient to equilibrium, from difference to sameness, from distinct order to jumbled chaos. According to the second law, entropy in a closed system can only increase, suggesting the universe itself must be like an engine irrevocably running out of fuel, destined for dissolution and death.
>
> At least, that was how its cosmic implications came to be interpreted by an increasingly modernized world. Primed to imagine life as a meaningless accident in an indifferent cosmos, this discovery fell comfortably in line with the grim reductionist worldview—even though it actually flew in the face of the scientific reductionism that had helped found that worldview (and would eventually help overthrow it entirely—something we’ll come back to)." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Reductionist science—along with nihilistic interpretations of thermodynamics and evolution—had fundamentally changed people’s perspective regarding the part that humans played in the cosmic whole, leading them to no longer see themselves as agential wholes but only deterministic meat-suits moving through space.
>
> As a consequence, people today who feel they know a thing or two (and likely find themselves in positions of power) can, as we said, confidently assert: Life’s just a cosmic accident; the fit survive by preying on the weak and stupid; morality’s a fairy tale invented to keep people in line; and, sooner or later, the sun will explode, the universe will end in heat death, and none of this dazzling sound and fury will have meant a goddamn thing—so why not live it up while we can? By the early 20th century, all of the ingredients for the meaning crisis were firmly in place.
>
> As it turns out, however, this nihilistic worldview is actually… well… just simply wrong. It is based on contradictions, incomplete science, and unjustified extrapolations—failures that the new science has since begun to correct, but which nevertheless still hold sway in the public imagination. Let’s unpack this and, in the process, introduce the new science of complexity.
>
> First of all, the classical reductionism of Newtonian physics was reversible; it didn’t matter in which direction you “ran the tape”—backwards or forwards—everything was just a matter of deterministic particles in motion.
>
> However, both thermodynamics and evolution were different. They presented a model of reality quite contrary to this idea, with laws that had a direction. Entropy demanded a distinct “arrow of time,” and descent with modification meant that life was growing more and more varied with time.
>
> Thus, despite being subsumed into the bleak modern worldview, these paradigms seemed to contradict some of its founding assumptions.
>
> But if this were true, and the universe was irreversibly unfolding in some particular direction, which direction was it? Thermodynamics and evolution glaringly contradicted one another on this crucial point. One suggested the world was losing its usable energy and winding down towards the simple uniformity and homogeneity of equilibrium; the other, that the world was becoming ever more differentiated and elaborately structured—even in a “progress towards perfection.”
>
> Well, which was it? Chaos or order? Inert sameness or dynamic novelty? What was the true ending to the cosmic story science was telling?
>
> The resolution of this conundrum would only come with the transcendence of the reductionist paradigm altogether—a process set in motion towards the end of the 19th century, and only fully realized quite recently." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Reductionism, and the worldview it gave rise to, are predicated on the idea that we can understand reality best by isolating parts from the whole. By first analyzing the components, thought the pioneers of modern science, we can then work our way up to an understanding of the totality—because, after all, isn’t the whole just a sum of its parts?
>
> Well, it just so happens: Nope, it’s not. It’s really, really not. We know now something that the early scientists didn’t (and couldn’t): that when it comes to the more complex realities of nature, it’s not just about the parts and how they work by themselves. It’s just as much—if not more—about how the parts relate to one another.
>
> Wholes are made not only of parts, but of the relations of those parts. How one part works in concert with another part, and that one with another, and all of them together—those are dynamics that matter as much as the stuff of the parts themselves. Wholes aren’t just things—they’re also processes." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Life had escaped understanding in terms of classical physics precisely because it was, contrary to the “isolated systems” studied in fields like thermodynamics, connected to and in direct relationship with its environment by flows of matter and energy.
>
> All of this would eventually lead to a truly revolutionary discovery—beginning a whole new field called non-equilibrium thermodynamics—which would contribute immensely to a radical re-conception of how energy behaves, and thus how life itself emerges and operates.
>
> ...
>
> But, Prigogine wondered, what if the system isn’t closed, but opened up to a flow of energy? That is, let’s say we’re not looking at water in a closed thermos anymore, but a pan of water over a lit stove. How does the system behave now?
>
> Simple as the idea was, the results were truly extraordinary. For, rather than spontaneously dissolving towards the disorder of equilibrium, the water in this scenario does the opposite: it spontaneously self-organizes, and structure emerges!
>
> Structures like this (called Bénard cells, after their original discoverer Henri Bénard) arise naturally, fueled by the energy flowing into the system. In fact—and here’s the amazing part—they arise precisely in order to dissipate that energy and generate the entropy demanded by the second law of thermodynamics! They emerge naturally because such configurations are simply more efficient at producing that entropy than more chaotic, disordered ones.
>
> A much more familiar example of such a dissipative structure (as Prigogine called them) is the whirlpool that appears in your bathtub when you pull the stopper. This highly ordered spiral gyre emerges naturally and spontaneously as the result of countless water molecules self-organizing. Why? Because such a configuration actually allows the water to drain faster.
>
> The natural tendency of the universe to seek balance and equilibrium can actually propel systems to become temporarily more ordered to achieve this end. That is, the same law that drives closed systems towards disorder and equilibrium actually drives open systems to generate order and complexity—and to remain “far from equilibrium,” in fact, as long as that flow of energy into the system persists.
>
> If this dynamic sounds familiar, it should. This is precisely the way that all living organisms operate, too! For life to accomplish all of the complex processes it must perform to resist entropy and stay highly ordered, it must be continually taking in new energy sources to metabolize.
>
> Or, in terms more familiar to us: If you don’t eat, you die. Life is always in relational exchange with its environment—a complex, open system, in which the second law operates to facilitate self-organization, keeping it far from equilibrium (i.e., death)." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Based on such discoveries, an additional law of thermodynamics has been proposed (first by Alfred Lotka and later by H. T. Odum) that includes the evolutionary implications of energy: “During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.”
>
> Energy self-organizes matter into life, and life self-organizes by maximizing energy. Or, as complexity scientist Harold Morowitz put it, “The energy that flows through a system acts to organize that system.”
>
> In this way, the dynamics of life became considerably clearer—not by looking at smaller and smaller parts (the way reductionism sought—and failed—to make sense of things), but by considering precisely the opposite: the relationship with the broader whole in which parts are embedded.
>
> More than that, a consideration of how the whole is changing can inform our understanding of the parts. In this case, the whole is the universe itself and the parts are everything in it. The fact that the universe as a whole is expanding means that the second law does not require that everything one day end in heat death. This assumption was likely far too hasty. The great complexity scientist Stuart Kauffman summarizes this point in reassuring terms in his 2016 book Humanity in a Creative Universe:
>
> 'The second law says free energy is running down. But we know now that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to the mysterious dark energy that comprises about 70 percent of the energy of the entire universe. The implications of this accelerating expansion is that we do not have to worry about enough free energy. As the universe becomes larger, its maximum entropy increases faster than the loss of free energy by the second law, so there is always more than enough free energy to do work.'
>
> The takeaway? The initial conclusions scientists had drawn from the laws of thermodynamics were wrong: the universe was not destined only to grow more and more disordered with time. That idea arose on the false assumption that isolated systems could tell us everything we needed to know about energy." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This self-organizing dynamic is a naturally cumulative, snowballing process that keeps building on itself—a process Prigogine called “order through fluctuation.” As energy pushes open systems farther from equilibrium, fluctuations in the energized system lead to threshold “bifurcation points,” at which the system is presented with novel, higher-order configurations as potential next stages of its evolution." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Evolution had suggested an increase in novelty, diversity, and complexity; now, thermodynamics agreed. More than that, it actually helped explain why and how complexification occurs, by linking the evolutionary process to free energy and emergent self-organization.
>
> In this way, evolutionary development was no longer something unique to life, but a process that could be expanded to include less complex matter, too. In his book Cosmic Evolution: The Rise of Complexity in Nature, Eric Chaisson writes:
>
> 'Life is an open, coherent, spacetime structure maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium by a flow of energy through it—a carbon-based system operating in a water-based medium, with higher forms metabolizing oxygen. Although the second part of this definition pertains to the living state as we know it, the first part could well apply to a galaxy, star, or planet… And that is the crux of our argument: Life likely differs from the rest of clumped matter only in degree, not in kind.'
>
> The degree to which it differs is one of complexity—for which Chaisson employs a specific metric, one that can be used to measure the complexity of anything from stars to living organisms: free energy rate density.
>
> As systems theorist Ervin László summarizes it in his pioneering book Evolution: The Grand Synthesis:
>
> 'Free-energy flux density is a measure of the free energy per unit of time per unit of mass: for example, erg/second/gram. A complex chemical system retains more of this factor than a monatomic gas; a living system retains more than a complex chemical system. This indicates a basic direction of evolution, an overarching sweep that, together with the decrease of entropy and of equilibrium, defines the arrow of time in the physical as well as in the biological and the social world.'
>
> Free energy flows through systems, organizing them into more orderly configurations. Order builds upon order, and complexity mounts—until whole new emergent levels appear, like life from matter. In this way, complexity is really just a measure of how energy organizes matter—something it has been doing to exponentially greater degrees as time passes." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "something else emerges: agency. Work by complexity researchers like Sara Walker, George Ellis, Giulio Tononi, Erik Hoel, and others has shed considerable light on the way more complex organisms come to exhibit causal power on their lower-level constituent parts. Such causal emergence repudiates the old deterministic account of organisms as being nothing but particles in motion. Rather, it shows that information generated at higher levels can have a causal effect on its material substrate. In this way, there is not only “bottom-up” causation from particles, but also “top-down” causation, as information encoded in patterns of organization at the macro-level works to direct material particles at the micro-level towards specific states and goals.
>
> Such causal emergence appears for the first time in earnest with the origin of life, as information in the genome is able to supervene over the molecular and atomic level, leveraging the parts towards the aims of the biological whole. This sort of agency gains entirely new levels of causal freedom and power, however, with the rise of more complex minded animals. In this way, the self-consciousness such as human beings exhibit can be understood as a uniquely complex form of causal emergence, whereby activity at the mental level exerts itself over and above the activity of the body. In this way, the will itself emerges. We are, then, not just determined automatons the way reductionists like Laplace envisioned, but genuinely free agents with self-determination, whose choices matter." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Unifying theories of complexity such as Azarian’s and Henriques’s bring together numerous strands of evidence into a clearly discernable big picture of reality. According to this picture, as the universe complexifies through a learning algorithm of experimentation and selective retention, it has hit upon new information processing mechanisms that have occasioned a few quantum leaps in knowledge accumulation. This increase in knowledge proceeds alongside increases in power (free energy rate density), configurational complexity, depth of sentience, and degree of intelligence." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Surprising as it may sound, self-consciousness required other selves to render it possible. The sense of self could not have emerged outside of society, because it is based on language and inter-subjective accounting. That is why self-consciousness is rightly understood as emerging not with Mind (which all animals possess), but with Culture. Only at the level of Culture has self-awareness and self-knowledge appeared in the universe." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Just as Life evolves by accretive modifications to DNA and Mind by accretive adjustments to experience, so Culture evolves by accretive conceptual development. Collective intelligence shapes meme networks—called “metamemes”—which individual self-conscious minds “download” to better navigate their environment. Such metamemes serve to justify, legitimate, and explain human behavior and natural phenomena in their unique contexts—making them effectively equivalent to what we have been calling worldviews.
>
> Because worldviews are evolving, they are also complexifying, generating more sophisticated wholes by incorporating more and more of the knowledge from previous justificatory worldviews. Like other evolving organisms, as they complexify, their energetic input and output likewise increases. As energy structures what it flows through, so human societies reconfigure into “more elaborate forms” over time. As more complex environments produce more complex challenges, knowledge is forced to increase, further driving the evolution of worldviews." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The vision of God we have been considering is, I believe, beautiful and profound. It is, however, admittedly somewhat different from how many people tend to think of God. Isn’t God supposed to be “all-knowing” (omniscient), “all-powerful” (omnipotent), and “all-loving” (omni-benevolent)? The God of Emergentism would seem to be only becoming such things. Is this God-concept really worthy of the name, then? Doesn’t thinking of God like this create too many problems?
>
> As it happens, thinking of God like this resolves many of the problems that have plagued religious thinking for millennia—particularly the thorniest challenge of all: the problem of evil and suffering.
>
> If we are to maintain that God is truly omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, and always has been and always will be, then how do we explain the unspeakable amount of pain and suffering in the world? If God made everything just as it is, knowing it would include all the mass extinctions, tortures, famines, plagues, genocides, rapes and molestations that have occurred and continue to occur—even though he could have made it all differently—then we can only conclude that such a God is evil.
>
> Even if we counter (as theologians have across the millennia) that such things only occur because God gave humans free will, it still does not resolve the problem. Much of the suffering in the world is from natural disasters, the basic fact of mortality, and systemic oppression—forms of suffering outside the ken of individual free will. In any event, if God were truly all-powerful, God could create free will such that it never produced any suffering (a thought which might seem paradoxical to us, but only because we live in a world where free will exists as it does—the suffering-dependent free will that God inexplicably chose to create). In short, considering the nature of the world we live in, if there were a God responsible for it all, that God could be all-loving or all-powerful—but not both.
>
> The idea that God is supposed to be both is a paradox which, failing to be resolved according to any rational notion, can only be embraced by asserting faithful cliches like “God works in mysterious ways” or “God’s ways are not our ways.” But try telling this to the man who lost his wife and children in a house fire, or the girl chained up in a man’s basement for decades as a sex slave. If you do not feel the aching inadequacy of such a rationalizing response to these horrors, your desire for existential comfort through theological platitudes has clearly blinded you to your own humanity.
>
> Suffering is real. And would any God worth the name have knowingly chosen it, had such a God power to do otherwise? According to the theology of Emergentism, God didn’t, and couldn’t. The Universe may be headed towards infinite Love, Compassion, Knowledge and Power, but it started off as mere radiation, spent billions of years as bacteria, and only gradually worked its way up to beings with any degree of awareness, let alone self-consciousness and a moral compass.
>
> God is not conscious enough in the lion to understand or amend the suffering of the elk. Graciously, the elk is not conscious enough to fully contemplate its own suffering, which would render it truly excruciating. The degree of consciousness renders suffering more acute, but also more amenable to alleviation.
>
> Only at the level of self-consciousness do morality and ethics emerge. Only once the Universe has come, via will, and then concepts (including counterfactuals), to self-awareness, can it choose to diminish suffering. Only then is it capable of doing so, and only then is it responsible to do so.
>
> Tennyson asked, “Are God and Nature then at strife, / That Nature lends such evil dreams?” In a way, Yes. Nature is not yet God; God is the future’s infinitely perfected Nature. After the Big Bang, but before apotheosis, Nature lacks the omniscience and omnipotence we attribute to its telos, God. On the other hand, because Nature tends towards God, and is God fundamentally (albeit in embryonic form), God is no more at strife with Nature than an adult is at strife with herself as a child. But we do not hold the child to the same standards as the adult. The child is still undeveloped. Progress requires imperfection.
>
> Accepting this view of things, suffering does not refute God, but only one conception of God (namely, as unchanging, omniscient, and omnibenevolent). Allowing for the changingness of God, for God’s evolution, resolves the paradox of suffering and divinity.
>
> Moreover, seeing that it is through self-conscious agents like us that God becomes aware, we lose the illusion that God is some perfect figure acting upon us from above, subjecting us to suffering, allowing terrors to occur, and so on. Instead, it is through the eyes of the world that God sees. God is the man who lost his family; God is the tortured girl. God does not escape suffering. God suffers because humanity suffers. Suffering humanity is God—torturer and tortured, crucified and crucifier. God is always on the cross; God is always the soldier who nailed him to it, too.

> The degree to which God aims to reduce suffering is tied to the depth of consciousness that allows for the recognition of suffering and the capacity to take responsibility for its alleviation." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Much suffering is meaningless, the consequence of a world in which God is not yet, but on the way. Laboring towards its alleviation hastens the coming of God into the world. Suffering for the alleviation of suffering is sacrifice. At the same time, it is an aim for human endeavors, and thus the source of meaning. And toiling in the divine labor is the most meaningful effort of all." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The “arrow of time” is thus the natural flow of the Universe towards its telos. Like a river flowing downstream, existence flows toward God. Just as the spiraling gyre arises spontaneously to facilitate flow, so the Universe organically self-organizes towards its maximally complex form: Divinity.

> The theophany of God in time culminates in a hypothetical future point of maximal complexity, consciousness, goodness, and power.

Otherwise, the disconnect between our simplicity and the complexifying world will reach a breaking point, and things will regress rather than progress, break down rather than break through." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "A religious traditionalist cannot comprehend how a modern materialist can live as though not being continually watched and judged by a personal, moralistic God. Nor can a modern materialist grasp what all this postmodern “environmental hysteria” is about that’s limiting economic growth and individual liberty.
>
> More complex, higher-dimensional worldviews are simply seeing parts of the puzzle that simpler, lower-dimensional worldviews can’t cognize." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Complexity, as we noted, is only the outward manifestation of an inner deepening of consciousness. As structural complexity increases so does the inner richness of experience. When we consider the full breadth of the Mandala of Emergences in relation to its associated increase in depth, then, we can imagine the attractor of the Omega singularity (God consciousness) drawing all the Universe towards it, just as a cosmic singularity curves all of space-time towards itself.
>
> Indeed, much as Einstein appreciated that space and time are like a single fabric warped by mass, so might we symbolize objective complexity and subjective consciousness as one single fabric — complexity-consciousness — warped by something like free energy rate density towards greater and greater subjective depth." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "This scientific revolution has allowed us to understand far more accurately aspects of what our religious forebears partially intuited, so that we can now re-integrate our findings into a comprehensive vision of the full richness of reality. When we do this, we are confronted with a truly remarkable vision. The cosmos is indeed organized according to a graded, hierarchical sequence. However, this sequence is arranged according to complexity. All its levels are made of the same basic stuff, and the scale unfolds through time, endlessly evolving and developing on its way towards an infinitely receding realization of perfection." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Religion is ultimately meaningless if it doesn’t affect how people live in the real world. It’s one thing to know, it’s another to do, and taking cosmic complexification seriously has a plethora of transformational implications for how we ought to be showing up in the world. Wisdom informs action. Hence the second meaning of religio: “observance,” as in “observing one’s duties/responsibilities”; the etymological opposite of the word “neglect.” Religion means living your beliefs." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "Simply put, Emergentist spiritual practice is about conscious participation in the awakening of the Universe.
>
> That means taking responsibility for ourselves as self-conscious agents, and directing our powers to intentionally raise the level of complexity-consciousness in ourselves, in others, and in the cosmos as a whole—ultimately, toward the realization that these are all the same." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "How might we amplify and assist the increase in order vs. chaos, vitality vs. decay, pleasure vs. pain, and Self-knowledge vs. ignorance? To develop a personal ecology of practices that succeeds in these endeavors would mean that we are consciously aiding the Universe in its own journey of awakening. We are the Self-consciousness of the Universe; our spiritual journey is God’s spiritual journey.
>
> ...
>
> From atoms to cells to moving bodies to symbolically-mediated self-consciousnesses, we have the Universe inside us. We must tend to all levels of the Wisdom Stack, then, if we are to be maximally integrated beings. And only as such integrated beings will we be ready and responsible to rise still further, through the next emergence on the horizon, towards our divine calling. For, ultimately, we must follow this trajectory to its true telos: an awakening to God consciousness, wherein we experience the true mystical union—subject with object, self with Self, that we might say “I AM,” knowing we are God, we are the Universe, we are Everything—the true Whole." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "The advent of modernity brought an incredible advance in human knowledge as it shifted culture from a relatively simple religious traditionalism rooted in 2D consciousness to a more complex naturalistic worldview rooted in 3D consciousness. Early science led the way, opening up vast horizons of understanding through a novel methodological approach that could cut through the confusion of a noisy world and zero in on the fundamental laws and forces of the Universe.
>
> Such reductionism was revolutionary for analyzing the world according to its discrete parts. It set off a cascade of dissection and differentiation, revealing the former subjective (con)fusion endemic to religious holism. So the individual self emerged more fully from its embedding in the world; the subjective/objective split was now complete.
>
> Though an important and necessary development, this analytical process was only the first step in a two-part movement. It represented the differentiation phase, wherein a simple whole is broken into parts in order for them to be considered in isolation. Such a phase is a necessary precursor, however, to the integration phase that follows, in which these newly identified parts are then considered in their wider relational context, revealing the true complex whole.
>
> The first centuries of modern science were all about differentiation. While revelatory, this reductionistic era naturally led to a worldview of fragmentation, dislocation, and alienation, as the world became atomized and all the most important wholes (e.g., the soul, the cosmos) were broken down to their lowest denominator and ultimately “dissolved into particles.”
>
> The view of the world in the midst of the differentiation phase is thus one in which there is no grand whole according to which our lives might have meaning. More than that, our very experience of our lives as conscious, free agents is seen as only an epiphenomenal illusion, since deterministic particles are alone what’s deemed “really real.”
>
> This way of seeing remains pervasive. Indeed, it provides the presuppositions that lie behind the nihilistic perspective of so many people today. The contemporary meaning crisis was born in the cultural transition from 2D to 3D consciousness, as the incomplete movement of differentiation was misinterpreted as the absolute nature of reality. Unfortunately, the premature conclusions of early modern science have become “frozen” within the Modern cultural code, an out-of-date justification system people keep downloading to make sense of the world.
>
> Meanwhile, the integration phase has begun, and has in fact been underway for some time. Through the systematic and meta-systematic insights of 4D and 5D consciousness, respectively, the parts identified by 3D science are at last being recontextualized into their relational, networked wholes. These recontextualizations constitute the revelations of complexity science, which has been identifying the emergent nature and workings of integrated wholes. Here, emergentism as a conceptual paradigm (small e), has led the way.
>
> With this neo-holistic paradigm, the reductionist narrative can be recognized for the true yet only partial and incomplete story that it is. In its place has arrived a new, more complete cosmic story: the story of evolutionary complexification.
>
> ...
>
> Matter emerged out of the haze, and gravity condensed it into clumps. Nature retained these clumps, which became stars and black holes swirling galaxies around them. Planets emerged, turning around the stars turning around the galaxies. Dissipative adaption built on dissipative adaptation, as energy organized what it flowed through. Life clicked on, and learned its environment through ever-updating genetic code. Elaborate nervous systems networked sensory input together into an integrated whole, and Mind emerged to learn its environment through ever-updating experience. Mind complexified, gaining the capacity for language and concept, wherein self-consciousness clicked on, and Culture began its long journey of psycho-social memetic complexification.
>
> In the course of this cultural evolution through the shapes of consciousness and their associated metamemes, Culture refined its own knowledge-creation process, eventually hitting on science, a human epistemological version of the Great Algorithm of variation and selective retention. With this, it began the above-mentioned differentiation and integration process, distinguishing Nature’s many parts before realizing their emergent holistic levels of holarchic order.
>
> Culturally, this is where we find ourselves today: between the Great Tearing Apart and the Great Re-Integration. Many people remain stuck in the fragmentation of 3D consciousness and its Modern reductionistic narrative, gripped by nihilism. Others recoil from this, and seek out the comforts of old 2D religion, with the old mythic God above and Judgment Day ahead. Those who have developed a 4D perspective can see the limitations of traditional religion as well as the modern world we’ve made, but often fall victim to the radical relativism of endless contextualization, or themselves recoil to the naive belief that 0D animism is what holds the key for all our ills.
>
> What is really needed, though, is to keep going forward, to keep evolving—to complete the integration phase, wherein we regain a holistic framework required for a meaningful existence and thus a sustainable world. The new cosmic story revealed by the unifying, integrative visions from complexity science will be key to this fruition." - [Emergentism: A Religion of Complexity for the Metamodern World, by Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65167542-emergentism)

> "We need a Religion 2.0 that has learned from the failures and limitations of Religion 1.0: namely, its dogmatic rigidity, censorship, oppressive power hierarchies, denigration of the body and the Other. We need a religion that’s open, up to date, and ethical. In short, we need a religion that works.
>
> Clearly, we must get ourselves right with purpose if we’re to survive an Anthropocene era. To use the language of systems analysis, we must find the “leverage points” for systems-level change, the points where solutions can be applied with maximal effect. And in a complex sociocultural system, where else is such an Archimedean Point to be found but in people’s beliefs—in their psychic orientations to reality, their foundational philosophies and unspoken axioms about the world? An intervention at this fundamental level for individuals can have vast, cascading effects on the larger systems they inhabit. Could Emergentism provide such a lever?
>
> The sort of “religion that’s not a religion” explored in this book is not just another closed-canon, close-minded set of beliefs either imposed, adopted, or rejected. Emergentism is open-source, co-created, and personally developed. Its cosmic story comes from scientists; its scriptures, from poets and artists. It is a religion of evolution and development by means of evolution and development. It is a religion of knowledge creation, refinement, and correction, and so itself shall be continually refined and corrected according to the same mechanisms the Universe itself has used to gain Self-knowledge since the dawn of time.
>
> Today, when people feel increasingly beset by despair and meaninglessness, Emergentism offers the invitation to participate in the manifestation of ultimate knowledge, beauty, power, and goodness in the world. At a time when people feel adrift and lost, without purpose, Emergentism calls us to help God incarnate and thereby realize the very telos of the Universe. At a time when everything feels pointless and nothing seems to matter, we are summoned to an epic cultural project to build the Cathedral of a new worldview, a new religion, a new age and a new Divinity—by means of our own unique and special flavor of individuality.
>
> You matter. You are a way for the cosmos to know itself. You are a railway for the cosmic Lightning. You are the very Self of the Universe coming to greater Self-consciousness: God awakening, God learning, God knowing, caring, and loving. You are the latent and creative light of emergence.
