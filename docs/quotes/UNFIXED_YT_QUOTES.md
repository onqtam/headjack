> "They ask why is fire hot it's the same kind of thing right like well we can talk about what the photon releasing is and how photons are exchanging energy in the hand but then why are my subjectively experiencing it as hot and so what happens is we just don't know so we don't answer their questions well and we instead steer them to things that we do know that are really not interesting like how to spell something or what the capital is something that is and we turn them off to schooling we turn them off to learning turn them off to their innate fascination of existing so when we look at the whole issue of the kind of welfare model dynamic where we think if people are not capitalistic aliy motivated they'll just watch TV all the time kids are so intrinsically motivated to learn everything they can and to build stuff and to create and to like want to go to work with mom or dad and figure out how to do stuff what happens is when we don't facilitate their interests and then we actively force them to be interested in that's just not interesting to them because there's more to do with memorization and getting it right than understanding mechanics in or dynamics and interesting ways we break their innate intrinsic interest in life and make them deferring to extrinsic Authority and then they just want to get away from that which ends up looking like play chill out is some form of you know escape from broken interest in life so the future of Education has the ability to have polymath be the new normal you know comprehensively developed multimodal genius as the new normal because that's actually innate to every child a friendly facility." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=502)

> "If I asked you who you are you'll tell me something but if I say we who are you without plants and you think about it and you think well who would you be without oxygen and atmosphere you wouldn't exist who would you be without the plants that produce the oxygen atmosphere you wouldn't exist you were actually the emergent property of a biosphere that made you possible it was mediated by plants and they were mediated by insects and microbes and a whole bunch of things right and so you can define yourself without thinking about the atmosphere in plants but it's a misnomer it's a wrong idea because you'd actually don't exist without all of them you are fundamentally interdependent with the whole rest of the biosphere not just Pasteur but the whole universe who are you without gravity some it's a nonsense question right who are you without electromagnetism it's a nonsense question so you are an emergent property of a universe that made you possible and you're still fundamentally interconnected with and interdependent with the whole thing so if you think of earth as actually you zoom out and you look at it from the outside space-shuttle picture and you see that it's this tiny tiny little bitty organic spaceship traveling to this vast cosmos that's very inhospitable place and you realize that on this tiny little organic fragile spaceship together everything in there is interconnected profoundly and eggs are interconnected and the idea that there's this place called away where we can throw our trash and these people called others that we can bomb and it's beneficial get their resources whatever that engenders their enmity back that whatever wherever the trash goes is affecting the air the water that Deeley everyone is engaged with we have a level of technology that gives us global influence and everything that we do when we're talking here and the headphones that we're talking on have plastics and metals and silicates etc that came almost every continent that had people and supply chains around the whole world that were involved it took resources from the earth in ways that were fundamentally on renewable caused massive massive problems extinction level problems for many species and then turned it into trash on the other side we're doing these seemingly benign behaviors like buying stuff this is actually affecting this little spaceship that we live on in ways that make it self terminating very quickly we have a level of population that we never had it's been an exponential risin since then this revolution and a level of impact per capita within that population that again is exponential that cannot continue in this way but we also have the technological capability to make fundamental changes where we don't have an exponential growth society where we don't have an economic system that requires year-over-year exponential growth on a finite planet which how the would that make any sense to do an exponential growth economy forever or a linear materials economy that turns nature into trash on a finite planet." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=2553)

> "Well if we said we can burn coal but you can't leave the commons net worse so the same amount of co2 has to be in the atmosphere afterwards so whatever it takes to scrub the co2 out of the atmosphere scrub the mercury out mine in a way that is regenerative to the whole ecosystem you have to use the technologies that do that well the cost to do that would make coal something like four orders of magnitude more expensive and solar would have reached grid parity the moment it was invented and so it's a nonsense economic system it is actually an extinction Airy economic system it not only allows but incentivizes external ization of harm to the Commons that is what led to coal making sense Oversoul right and so many other things like that." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3087)

> "So the key thing that has to happen and in the future of macroeconomics is that we have to make sure that what we're incentivizing people and companies and what we're incentivizing agents to do is Omni positive so we're not giving anyone incentive meaning they get ahead economically by doing something that is fundamentally harming other agents arming the Commons otherwise we're continuing to cause the problems at the deepest level by incentivizing them based on what our counting systems right based on our value systems and so what we need is to incentivize things in relationship to how Omni positive they are which means you have to measure everything affected not just a few of the things but measure everything affected internalize all of those positives and negatives into the value equation and then incentivize things accordingly so to the degree that we make an incentive of any agent more close to perfectly aligned with the well-being of other agents in the Commons is the degree to which the economic system becomes a source for solutions to everything rather than us or for problems everything." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/6fWfvO72vAw?t=3205)

> "To the degree you succeed at it then you're trapped by the continuation of that curve forever so notice the smarter the kids are smart meaning good at that particular definition of smart the earlier we push them in the hyperspecialization right we want to get them in AP classes towards their specialty young and then the further we push them in specialization so by the time they do their dissertation 10 people in the world know what the fuck they're talking about so they know so much about such a narrow area so they're not thinking about big picture things or thing interdisciplinary things at all that means that the smartest people aren't actually questioning macroeconomics and questioning culture and questioning governance questioning the foundational axioms of how we do academia or science because they're they're just doing one tiny little thing so we're training them to be very sharp cogs in the industrial way yeah that's true and the only people are usually left thinking about any big picture things are people that didn't have those types of proclivities and that is that your way of taking things that could be dangerous and making them not only not dangerous but very good tools of the continuation of a particular system and so because you didn't actually do that well at it then you were able to say fuck it I don't want to do something totally different." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=540)

> "If the kid who gets a 4.0 one of the keys of getting a 4.0 is making no mistakes right like that's how you that's how you write that is that you need everything right and everything perfect now everything right means you learned what had already been figured out was the Orthodox truth and you were able to repeat it effectively right and then at a certain point once you understand that system completely enough you can extend it a little bit which you know in the postdoc level you take the current whatever the field is an extended a tiny bit after proving that you understood it you know perfectly people who got a lot of praise and a lot of success and identity around never making any mistakes and getting everything perfect are not oriented to do things that have a very high risk of failure that's great so true so when when kids are praised for getting things right you [ __ ] them up because a number of things one so think about this in general all the praise that kids get is when they do something that the authority wants them to do and has already designated as right and good and true right so whether it's the teacher the preacher of the parents they get praised for doing what someone else wanted them to do they almost always get punishment for doing things that made sense to them that they wanted to do so this is how you conditioned people to be well you know cogs within an authoritarian system where we defer our own agency our ability to assess the world in our own agency to somebody that knows better than us and the teacher the preacher the parent right they all represent that and then it becomes the boss and the you know macroeconomy the state the etc writ large and so if we want people that actually can really be innovative we can't train them that way we have to train them to self assess and self initiate and not actually get hits of praise from getting something right that others already figured out and when we do that like oftentimes there's a kid who becomes a Spelling Bee champion or math genius because they just happen to fucking figure out like how spelling works or how math works and they got so much praise for it and they weren't getting enough unconditional love otherwise that they were optimizing for the extrinsic reward associated with the math of getting the prey is even though they might actually hate math or be not terribly interested in that they just happened to get it if you didn't do that then you might find math is alright but they're actually fascinated by art and so then they can become very good at something they have no passion for and it's all based on extrinsic motive that is damaging intrinsic motive." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=704)

> "Let's take em the issue of race okay which is right at the heart of that topic we can make it race we can look at gender we can look at transgender LGBTQ we can look at any of those dynamics that are part of the the identity politics part you're bringing up right now this is related to post-modernism and it derives some of its intellectual basis from post-modernism but it's also related to some other key things so if we look at race and we look at black lives matter or people of color movement or etc we have not ever properly dealt with the fact that this country was that this land that we call this country was fully inhabited by lots of nations of people that would completely slaughtered to make this land right it was we're gonna we're getting taxation without representation in London we don't want to be here anymore so we're gonna go somewhere else and hey look there's a whole continent that's totally free because we have better military than equipment than they do so we can kill all those people and take the whole land there's a real moral [ __ ] problem - having your moral legitimacy as the United States of America beautiful Constitution Declaration of Independence being based on genocide and we're pretty happy to acknowledge like after Germany's genocide they're [ __ ] up right there's a whole cultural thing but our genocide was not that long before and it was more people there was a lot more people wow that's interesting and it was the genocide of the Native American people employing the slavery of the Africans and we mean real [ __ ] slavery like captured the people by military force killed lots of them tortured and killed lots of them lynching etc and we like we don't want to really acknowledge that this country was built with that it was built with a pretty decent amount of Chinese slavery a lot of African slavery and one major genocide alright so then we've got you know we have to fight a war to finally get rid of slavery not that long ago like really not that long ago where there are old people alive today that still remember elements of slavery dynamics right like that's a big deal to get but then ok so we abolish slavery without abolishing the mindset that was associated with it so a lot of people didn't want to gone so then we've got Jim Crow and segregation and all that and then we kind of overturn that kinda right but slaves actually economically work really well it's kind of nice to be able to have people do all the [ __ ] work and not get paid and be able to concentrate the profit margins and as soon as you don't want to do that with the slaves now people got to take you know other people have to take the [ __ ] jobs and who wants to [ __ ] jobs and now you have to dilute the profit margin to pay minimum wages so there's a lot of people that didn't like that right for legitimate understandable reasons and they could justify making another group of people different enough that slavery was better than their own sacrifice in that zero sum game dynamic right or near zero-sum games anyway and then we have okay so now it's not full segregation legally but that mindset still there and the people who are coming out of segregation have generations of trauma and no education and no inheritance right as opposed to people who are coming from generations of education in hair and not the same types of trauma so we have the ghetto phenomena and what that means and we we know how epigenetic trauma works now generationally right we know how mimetic trauma works and so then we look at do we still have a system of systemic injustice [ __ ] yes we still have a system of systemic injustice and anyway person who wouldn't just train to be black recognizes that the ethics of the pie slice theorem aren't in place right pie slice theorem is if it's just there is a cemetry right between you and I which is all kite the slice of pie and you get a pic which side but I don't get a cut and pick right if I cut and pick there's something [ __ ] up or you can cut and I'll pick but anyone who says I wouldn't want to trade positions with the other person but they should be fine with it there's a problem and that's that's the dynamic here so there is a real response to unresolved trauma that is still affecting things now that said the response is coming from a place that is largely influenced by trauma rather than clear strategy and trauma usually perpetuates itself and so if a bunch of people with black lives matter is saying hey there are real issues where where there are a lot of black people who are getting killed by police for reasons that are totally unfounded and then not getting prosecuted in the same way not getting attention in the same way like that's a real deal and how does anyone go about trying to go to school and feel safe when you can be going to school doing all the right things and and have that kind of dynamic occur all right so then they go shut down a freeway out of like upset and anger whatever and then while that's trying to get attention for something that is real it is strategically problematic right because then you have the alt-right largely arising as a response to those type of dynamics saying look our way of life that we care about is being threatened and look these people are rioting and causing chaos and whatever they're validating our ideas about them not being strategic good thinkers etc and so and because of a postmodern dynamic that in general the progressive left has it makes it harder for them to cohere because they want to validate everyone's perspective because they're suffering they're still in response to the pain of imperialism or one in perspective is imposed on everyone so part of the response is to say hey [ __ ] everybody actually has a perspective and the perspective that you're saying is just true because it's science or whatever a lot of our social science that arose at the same time as our physical science was actually just imperialism and so post-modernism emerged amongst I'm radically simplifying here post-modernism emerged with a partial meaningful truth which was to say this is just objectively true this is science we did the right epistemology subjectively true and it's true for everybody doesn't acknowledge that especially as we get into the social sciences there's a [ __ ] ton of bias right and so we you know we went looking for monogamy and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom because of Victorian age ideas that actually made us do zoology badly right and so we'd like we see that kind of thing everywhere so post Martin said actually different perspectives on reality running different experiments end up yielding different kind of insights and we still know that are you healthiest on a vegan diet or a paleo diet I can show you just as much [ __ ] research on both of those that look at different metrics right and so whether I'm looking at pH or I'm looking at insulin levels or I'm looking at telomere levels like I'll get different answers and also which populations but when I try and reduce health to some finite set of metrics and there's a million [ __ ] metrics that we can't calculate I can get a lot of partial answers that seem like the whole answer and seem like complete science because I'm studying a very complex system in a very simplistic way so bias is very easy when you trying to set a complex system in a simple way because your metrics look really [ __ ] clear that they just don't happen to be all the metrics that matter and so post-modernism acknowledged that and said hey all the perspectives actually have to be factored now there was a kind of virulent version of that that didn't acknowledge there all the perspectives should be acknowledged but they're not all going to be equally true some of them can have distortion in them so we need to be able to bet for distortion and all the perspectives are going to be less different in simpler systems so in chemistry the epistemology is more straightforward than it is in social sciences and some of the virulent version of post-modernism to start rejecting truth writ large right like any claim of truth as a clip is an imperialist claim and nobody can claim truth and all perspectives are equally true and but we can see that that was a virulent version of an appropriate response or a to Abram period is 'm capitalism along with fucking's like you know colonialism like all kind of Co emerged and trying to untangle those was like part of the goal there so if you actually read Foucault or dare at all there's meaningful good thinking in there most of what you see happening that tries to intellectually reify itself with those people is not actually being done very well but that's because trauma is influencing a lot of it but then on the other side we've never actually taken responsibility to deal with that that trauma was created so when I say it's nuanced it is and it's a really big deal because if we look at the all the alt-right and the control left they have moved to a level of polarization and radicalization that is very hard to imagine how that reconciles and with a tremendous amount of fear on both sides and trauma on both sides and associated with that the desire for secession from the nation the desire for whatever that leads to war in a world where military technology assets that we don't get to make it through wars the way we did in the past and so the idea hey look we fought a war with the British to come get this area and it worked well yeah we had [ __ ] muskets right and as the military technology goes up it becomes more and more problematic and when we get to the level where you have decentralized exponential technology which is where we're at right now we don't get to make it through Wars anymore and humanity has always had different dynamics that led us to polarization and radicalization and then war and we have to actually learn how to [ __ ] deal with that and part of it is we have to be able to understand how to take multiple perspectives they have partial truth that they're not successful parts you know find the successful parts and figure out how to do dialectic how to do synthesis and be able to find a solution that doesn't just solve for some things well journalizing harm to something else it's effective but actually sold for the whole set okay so that's just the post-modernism snowflake part." - [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/OLWihHrj6zs?t=1114)

> "When in the depression there were people openly on the streets discussing socialism Marxism lazy fair capitalism because the system was failed right you in a failed state people are open to like look at any possibility we are very near a failed state and we're actually very near a failed civilization globally so when you look at climate change and the fact that we can't [ __ ] get it right right like we can't get it right we we keep driving ourselves towards the point of self induced catastrophe and possibly extinction and despite the fact that the Club of Rome identified this over shooting limits in this 60s right and and limits of growth in the world through model the spoon despite the fact that it's been called that we're following the model we keep progressing on the [ __ ] model right the Paris Accord was not enough for us to make it we would have everything would have been [ __ ] if we did the Paris Accord and we couldn't even do that right and so and that's driven mostly by our current structure of capitalism because if I over fished the ocean right if I use a mile long drift net and I take all these [ __ ] fish out of the ocean that's more money for my fishing company this quarter and leaving them in the ocean is worth nothing to me economically now it's worth something in the future but the other guy is going to fish them out if I don't fish them out so it's not like I can leave them there for the future so it is a competitive race for near-term wins mortgaging the future so we make thirteen species a day extinct on average we've fished out 90% of the large fish species from the ocean on a 3/4 water planet that took 3 billion years to get all that [ __ ] life and in a hundred years of industrialized fishing we fished out 90% of the large fish species extincted many of them 80% of the old-growth trees gone that's capitalism working really great not working really great right we're on the verge of a very realistic AI apocalypse where we should be developing the area very slowly we should be very intelligently looking at what it because unlike you know when when Edison's working on a light bulb and light bulb fails it just doesn't work maybe it blows up no big deal you do it inside of a container you work on AI and it fails and sometimes it doesn't work and sometimes it kills everything because it is an autopoietic tech it is a self-organizing self authoring tech light bulb isn't it works or it doesn't work but it's built on the outside but but biotech right where you make a new [ __ ] life-form and now it replicates and it does its own mutation that is a self-replicating tech where if you get it wrong you don't get a stop it and nuclear wasn't right nuclear is a reaction and then it stops it's really bad but nanotech biotech and AI are autopoietic self-replicating tech that might be depending upon how we do them in commensurate with biological life as we understand it with faster feedback loops than us now we should develop that as slow as [ __ ] possible because the upsides are awesome but we should do it in highly controlled safe to fail environments but all of the fiscal incentive is getting to market first that's a capitalist incentive who gets to market first where we're in a race towards the cliff and the arms race is the same thing why do we have when Carl Sagan showed us in the early 80s that it only took four 100-megaton bombs to kill all life on Earth with a nuclear winter why do we have 600 times that many like why the [ __ ] do you keep making nukes after you have enough to kill everything down to viruses because if you have a for-profit military-industrial complex where you have a source of supply where you need to manufacture more demand to keep your supply going it's not like supply and demand is a real thing there's an initial demand you create a supply but now you you have supply and you manufacture artificial demand which is why we buy all kinds of [ __ ] that doesn't make us happy that we think will make us happy because marketing creates artificial bland so capitalism is actually broken existentially so there are people who learned that okay Marxism had some nice ideas and there were some good ideas it didn't actually end up working out that well no of course if we really go study if we never implemented Marxism just like we've never implemented lazy faire capitalism we've implemented weird models of capitalism and by the time the USSR came around it was nothing like Marxism for a bunch of reasons but Marxism doesn't actually work at scale it it works that kind of model works at a hundred and fifty person tribal model it doesn't extend beyond it capitalism did seem to work but of the cost of radical externality that externality when you get to this many people in this much tech actually self implodes so what has worked up to this point worked worked epic at but you when we say it worked up to this point we have been utilizing unknowable resources moving towards the point of criticality the whole time and it has required war right and it has led to diseases we didn't have before because of environmental devastation and etc and we have a world war today almost everyone has low-grade mental illness like Luba quit Asst addiction ubiquitous low-grade anxiety existential angst fairly decent low-grade depression right these are not natural to the human condition tribal people don't have this [ __ ] in the same way so we say it works define work this is optimizing for some metrics at the expense of others in a complex system so the fact that there are people questioning is there a [ __ ] better system than this because we're not fixing climate change in the system where it's still more profitable to do the [ __ ] up thing with a perverse incentive is ubiquitous in health care why do we do biohacking stuff like why doesn't health care prevent diseases because there's no [ __ ] money in preventing diseases there's a lot of money in treating them there's no there's not that much in curing them but there's a lot in treating them forever so what is gonna get researched when the money goes in has to have ROI back out of the capitalist system so the fact that people are recognizing that in questioning is a very good thing now the fact they try to find other things that didn't work as the answer is just a basic basically hopelessness and a lack of knowing how to go about solving something so [ __ ] hard so one of the core foe of my life is what is the macroeconomy of the future what are the governance system sort of the civilization systems they can allow us to actually human together well without needing to go to war and unknowable use of resource and producing a bit with this mental and physical illness that's unnecessary and etc and it's not any system that has ever happened so we can get into that if you want to or we can go to other directions but also most of the young people who say communism what they're really saying is Denmark looks better than here like that's a social kind of dynamic where better access to medicine don't have a lot of homeless people masters to PhD is average level of education largely secular because of that like the Nordic countries just look better they are they're just [ __ ] better there's more socialized dynamics now are they better on every metric no if you look here we have a tremendous amount of innovation here because of certain types of freedoms and a tremendous amount of damage and our bell curve is very spread out and so for everyone who's not winning at the system to say nobody is losing as bad in Denmark as they are here and there's a lot less of them and they're not ruining the environment as fast they're actually figuring their trash problem out maybe let's actually think about this and I'm actually not proposing Denmark as a solution I am saying there are a lot of things that are actually evidentially better on meaningful metrics and things that are adequate to the scope of what do we do with almost 8 billion people and distributed exponential technology don't yet exist." - [Daniel

> "When you think about grammar if you just look at the superficial definition of grammar you see that it has to do with the constraints surrounding the way in which our expressions our words our phrases can be put together such that meaning emerges from them that is comprehensible by other actors who are the receivers of these expressions that's grammar grammar is the way the order the way in which we pluck from possibility space the giant possibility spaces that we've been talking about specific combinations that actually are able to communicate information and coordinate action and so when i'm talking about this grammar of emergence or axioms of emergence what i'm trying to kind of get at is a a different way of approaching the ontology and epistemology of our world or of our reality of the way that most people begin to think about or work or try to ascertain an understanding of the things that are happening around them. So you know one like if we go all the way back to the beginning of this question you know we realize that if we accept the axiom or if we accept the idea that all structure must emerge bottom up and then those structures can parameterize other previously emergent structures top down right so like things have to actually come into being from simpler structures into spaces of more complexity and they don't always have to go monotonically or only in that direction like you can have you know complexity catastrophe you can have collapse you know that can be kind of a random walk to some extent but the whole point is that when we see complex objects you know especially in a world before we had any frame of reference for talking about emergence or bottom bottom-up order how did we approach reality how do we approach understanding well we came at it from an outside-in perspective we came at it from a top-down perspective from that initial perspective we were coming from the outside in we were coming from the highest states of complexity and trying to reduce them to simpler rules which is part of that dissective frame of reference we were talking about earlier so you know for the majority of modernity one might even consider that the entire foundation of modernity is related to this idea that we are able to take complex structures operate from the outside in peeling back those layers bringing them into parts creating ontologies that allow us to categorize those parts and then uh developing tools techniques or frameworks specializations specialized domains with respect to being able to perform work based on the knowledge we've gained and that's gotten us quite far you know there's a lot of utility in that i mean i'm not denigrating that in any way but what we're coming to realize is that we're now in a phase where so much of our ability to take the next step depends on far more integrated processes and as anyone who's taking a calculus class can tell you integration is exponentially more difficult than differentiation right and i think there's a fundamental reality fundamental truth there it's not just because you're doing calculus it's because of the fact that when you're doing something like differentiation you can apply locally bounded rules right which is very similar to the reductive paradigm where you can basically dissect reality into local subsets of reality that behave predictably but when it comes to integration you need a far broader understanding of the dynamics and tendencies of the systems that might be involved and also there's this element of intuition to it in many ways integration is much more of an art form it's much more difficult to to fully reduce to analytic equations and so i use grammar to talk about this process as opposed to you know the mathematics i mean axioms are similar right but axioms are actually one might say the grammar of any given mathematical perspective and i say mathematical perspective because the perspective of possibilities in any given mathematical domain emerge from the axioms right the axioms are the fundamental combinatoric kernels of that mathematical space and how they are put together all of the possibilities of how they are put together constitute all the domain of possible expressions in that mathematical space mathematicians then go through that possible space you know examining trying to basically find certain expressions that they can connect to other expressions such that they can demonstrate within those axioms that they are true so it's a kind of a closed system but but grammar and language on the other hand is a generative and open system in the sense that our language is evolving our grammar tends to evolve and the degree of permanence that structures that are generated by our grammar attain is related pragmatically mostly to their function in the world do they actually perform useful work and can they be recombined with other structures to perform useful work which is a much more pragmatic perspective than the formal or analytic perspective of mathematics and so i think that in what we're beginning to see now what is beginning to emerge across a number of domains you know at the santa fe institute at some other complexity research institutes with respect to you know certain researchers and theoretical biology as well we're starting to generate narratives and grammars around how we can think about patterns that are not domain specific and how those patterns those grammars of emergence can be used as containers or locations rallying points let's say for the process of coming to synthesize or integrate all of this domain specific knowledge that we have generated that are currently you know we kind of currently have this landscape this post babel landscape of hyper specialization and to some extent there's a great deal of value that we can derive from reintegrating some of that and reintegration requires translation requires grammar and i don't think that we're going to find the ability to reintegrate or or successfully integrate across those different specializations those domains through further grammars of differentiation through more reduction we have to be able to find synthesis and and that's very much what i would say this entire next episteme or this entire next paradigm that we're moving into is going to be about." - [Matthew Pirkowski](https://youtu.be/yrCW5jvBhm0?t=3405)

> "In the repeated prisoner's dilemma for example the most crucial condition is that the probability of another round has to be greater than the cost to benefit ratio if that is the case there is a chance that natural selection favors cooperation if there is not the case there is no chance so if you say there could be situations in the real world where that temptation to defect is so high that this debt probability of continuation it just this mechanism is not operating then this is in agreement with our analysis you need something else and what you could say what you need and our institutions and in our field we have also began to analyze the effect of institutions which is a fascinating world and became into debt sort of in two steps the one was the proposal that you can stabilize cooperation with punishment and the punishment that was introduced was a pure punishment where people can sort of cooperate in a public goods game a public good game is a prisoner's dilemma with more than two people or not and afterwards they can actually pay something to take away from somebody else and we call this peer punishment and this peer punishment can lead to people cooperating in the public goods game but it has the problem that actually it would lead to retaliation in situations where I'm if I get punished you know I could try to retaliate against the punishment instead of increasing my cooperation so beer punishment is something that works in some circumstances but actually whenever that mechanism of interaction is possible I find it's more likely being used to detrimental effect other than upholding public cooperation because it is in order to reinforce dominance of some individuals over others and most institutions want Excel to make sure that this peer punishment is not what is happening because that would destroy the productivity in the group so instead of letting individual people punish in those situations the next step is to say let's have an institution and the institution could then give punishment to people who defect in the public goods game and in our analysis this is usually done in such a way that first the people are asked are you willing to pay money in order to establish such a institution if enough people pay for that institution that institution comes into effect and then whoever defects in the public good game is automatically punished by that institution and that seems to work much better than peer punishment and that would be the argument in favor of institution." - [Martin Nowak: 'The Evolution of Cooperation' | 2015 ISNIE Annual Meeting](https://youtu.be/A8Y0kCdYoug?t=2870)



> "I actually think climate change is gonna require a new set of global governments a new form of global governance that we haven't even imagined yet I don't exactly know what it's gonna be but when I think about the issues like solar to engineering I don't think the UN is up for the task and I don't think the framework of the Paris agreement or anything else like that is really capable I think something new is going to emerge and it's not going to emerge because of altruism or because we all have some enlightenment I think it's gonna be because of necessity you know HG Wells had a great line I think it was in the time machine where he wrote we are kept keen on a grindstone of pain and necessity and I think there's a truth to that that that a lot of the innovation in the 21st century is gonna come not because we're enlightened or we reach some kind of spiritual connection with the earth system but because frankly we're up against it and we have to innovate or or fail to survive." - [Daniel Schrag](https://youtu.be/qCJLkwzNy_4?t=5345)

> "Economists who have been the most insightful in my opinion are the ones that have focused on what's happening inside companies because I think economists have to start investigating more and more non market mechanisms not as the exception to the economy but is perhaps the heart of the economy with the market mechanism just being a necessary important efficient part of a much larger tool set of social technologies this sometimes gets brought up with public policy and so on so people may talk about governance interventions they might talk about the economics of decision making policymaking and so on but you know except for coats's theory of the firm I don't see much work on how internal organization of companies might work arguably the one of the genius points of Silicon Valley has been to focus what happens within your startup and focusing on things like company culture no no let's assume company culture is real and let's assume that it is as tangible a future of the company you know the social technologies you use internally as any product might be and I think they've reinvented something completely different." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/FyJa_TnwSB4?t=578)

> "Society is not automatic I think it's fundamentally an artificial process that we've constructed to a significant degree our civilization relies on Cornerstone institutions and various kinds of knowledge uh to persist into the indefinite Future these are not natural phenomena social engineering has been employed at every major Reformation or transformation of society therefore I think the appreciation for this infrastructure and also an understanding that we have to be intentional about its renewal rather than rely on society evolving in its own way Society evolving in its own way is just the actions of other people transforming it so I think the basic idea is a civilization as a collection of symbiotic institutions." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=161)

> "Flourishing institutions I would argue are uh functional institutions so this means that they fulfill uh their given purpose they also tend to be adaptive so I believe that you know automated processes can't really process information the way human beings can so if you have this purely bureaucratic system where people are collecting records uh such as might exist in an organization like the IRS perhaps it's a well-functioning machine but without key uh individuals that have the ability to transform and reform such an organization it can truly be adaptive and change to uh differing circumstances so I think that when civilizational failure has occurred in the past it was because either the automated structure these big you know bureaucratic structures be it say the Catholic church at one point in medieval history or be it something like the IRS they either broke down from lack of Maintenance or they were functioning as designed but their environment transformed so I think to have flourishing institutions you need to have flourishing people you need to have individuals who understand the actual social fabric of the working of an organization by this I mean how things get done we all have this very rich tcid knowledge uh when we work in our own professional environment but often have these very vague imprecise thoughts about different domains of society where we just take the face value descriptions and run with them everyone's environment is quite information rich I know of no organization where the written description of the organization and how it actually works are the same thing and I've yet to hear a satisfying description of Human Social Life right in other words the task of anthropology that to you know study human beings as such is incomplete so as we operate with imperfect knowledge and we try to understand the world around us those of us who are a little bit more successful at this task of understanding can build and redirect institutions so that they can adapt to any sort of changing circumstance that might arise and you know the historical evidence for this is is quite solid you have these states that overcome events like massive climate change such as drought and so on they undertake new irrigation projects or they might compensate that irrigation is no longer viable by you know conquering new lands or they might set up a system of grain storage the difference between you know a society or civilization that fails because of natural resource constraints and the ones that succeed is often this adaptability to the changing parameters of both natural and the geopolitical world around them." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/Kw74a1dPEJQ?t=366)

> "Spirituality is just one of the passengers in the car that we call religion and every religion has got at least four components to it it's got spirituality and actually if you examine the spirituality of all the world religions huge amount of overlap like eighty percent of life they use the words a little bit differently there's a couple little technical you know differences but it's like eighty percent the same message that you are part of something greater that all things are connected that your individual life matters and so on so forth right these tend to be true of every single spiritual part of every religion but there's these other things that are in every single religion there is there tends to be a system of laws there tends to be a a metaphysics around how the world is created and there also tends to be a method of propagation now you have to understand why these things exist inside of religion they exist because religion is one of the most it at once it's the um you know it is both kind of the most pernicious and dangerous but also one of the most elegant social technologies that have ever existed because when you think about the history of religion most of these religions came up when there was no written word there was no printed word we could not actually pass knowledge in other ways if you tried to you know put all the wisdoms of your society into a specific tribe a lot of times those tribes were overrun by a neighboring tribe so we needed a mechanism to pass human knowledge forward through the generations during times of significant turmoil and what knowledge do we need to pass on well definitely spirituality and this is why all religions have that but we also needed to pass on laws and we also needed to go past on what we believed about the natural world and we also needed to and no religion was able to pass that on without having a means of propagation and the means of propagation are things like oh you should procreate and like go conquer the earth and other ones you know you should go teach but you know they have different means of provocation but every religion has at least those four components now there's a time and place when those components were the best technologies that we had for the day for those things so if you think about biblical times a lot of communities were just really collections extended collections of extended families so there might be four or five six extended families all living together in a tribe of 80 or 100 people and that's a pretty normal configuration now when you think about why you would stone an adulterer to death it's like well adultery involves three families three families in the space of a tribe of five families could completely tear apart the entire tribe and put everybody's life at risk so during that time even though it's a barbaric law it's not a completely unfathomable law that you would just stone the adulterers to death and be like you three you up we're going to stone you all to death and we just go on with our lives the other 80 of us will just keep going now that's an incredibly stupid law today right you know right now like today it's like you have that kind of falling out you get a diverse you you move to another city it's not a big deal right but it's like at the time it was actually not an incredibly stupid law now what happens is when we take the package of religion you know as a whole without ever looking at it and without seeing it alive in a live sense in our modern lives then we we choose a kind of active ignorance relative to all these different components so something like laws about adultery or the place of women in society and so on and so forth maybe it made enough sense a couple thousand years ago but they're stupid now and we have better systems of loss this is why there there is ongoing friction between government and religion because religion used to be the way that we propagated government and those aspects of religion run into modern forms of governance they are don't totally jide with democracy they don't totally jive with freedom of speech they don't totally jive with all these things that we found to be better ways of governing and organizing people metaphysics is another piece where you know in every religion they have to say well how is the world created and what you know what does it mean when there's a terrible storm and all these sorts of things so all of them also had to create these creation myths and talk about how the world was and that you know they did the best they could at the time it was their rough version of science and modern science does a ton better at explaining how the universe came into existence which is why we're not arguing about turtles on top of turtles or you know things being created in six days you know a couple thousand years ago that's madness now it was fine enough for the answers that people needed a couple thousand years ago about how the world was created because those were good enough answers for them to get on with life but what happens is imagine religion is a car and there's four four passengers in the car spirituality um you know governance metaphysics which is their take on science and propagation and the other passengers in the car are really unruly right propagation is why we had the crusades two different propagation that's running into each other on how a religion spread leads to religious war and this is the essential distinction that most people don't get they think to themselves and this you have to understand why it's like this it's you know part of the method of propagation is to ask people not to question religion because if you question it too much it starts to pray too much so as it tries to propagate from from generation to generation you lose too much of what it was and then it eventually fizzles out so a thing that had been a perfect elegant way to propagate knowledge from through generations thousands of years ago stops being the perfect elegant way because the other religions that were a little bit more loosey-goosey and prayed and nobody could tell what they were anymore they just you know a little bit of dallas beliefs are inside of this and a little bit of so-and-so is inside of this but it was too afraid to have the same sort of weight and energy as a religion that taught all of its adherence to not mess with what was in the box don't mess with the passengers in the car they just are how they are you just have to deal with it right so it's a cleaner method of propagation which is perfect if you want things to you know to a message to stay for hundreds or thousands of years but in the modern society as we start to blend with each other and learn from each other it's it's a bit outdated to never question those things never understand you know that the point of religion in the first place was to create better you know a better experience of life and if you if you're not able to go back and look at those questions or religion it's exactly what you told your son it's like if those beliefs do not create a better experience of life you need to drop them and that's the element that has not been allowed to be in religion the people that understand spirituality already understand that the stuff's all the same that all the other stuff

> "I think institutions can be considered almost sort of these units of social organization and they are very frequently copied and very frequently renovated and introducing a new type of institution into a society can radically transform it I think this is one of the reasons that often the greatest periods of civilizational flourishing is when different civilizations meet and one institution is introduced from a radically different selective environment different mtic selective environment different political environment and finds a productive Niche and thrives in that way." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=1376)

> "I would even argue that the stylistic differences between scientific papers in 1920 versus 2020 suggests that we have already lost much of what was once the practice of science well read uh a scientific paper from 1910 1920 1930 pick a topic of arbitrary complexity it can be a quantum mechanics paper even the style is going to be much less dry than any modern paper even any modern paper it's going to be less formulaic it's going to be much less formulaic it's going to be very economical with jargon it's going to be very um straightforward very precise but also beautiful why is it beautiful it's beautiful because it's meant to be read by human beings not committees it's beautiful because it is a remnant of the old peer review which we have nearly forgotten the old peer review being hey I trust this person's intellectual taste I will submit to their journal and they will decide if they publish me in their scientific journal if my work is bad I'll be embarrassed in front of our scientist for friends that's old peer review new peer review in the 20th century is the nominally meritocratic and rational committee the problem with the committee is you must agree with every member of a committee even if they disagree with each other so over time this has produced a very stilted form of writing and it is a writing that is Dreadful to read right even if you're super interested in the subject matter which means most academic papers are not read so who are they produced for why are we producing so many papers well it's hard to give the government a kpi for the scientific research it's funding an easy kpi is oh we have 50 researchers working this no we have 500 scientists working on this no we have 5,000 uh phds in chemistry working on this problem so the inflation of headcount and you can also say our department has published so many papers so many scientific papers and one point the scientific paper was obviously a good advancement now let's in social science for example we had the replication crisis go through and you know basically torch entire fields of knowledge the publication of a paper is not news anymore it's like not even news for people in the field right but it is a requirement to publish papers to achieve funding and to achieve uh accreditation right so that this this hyper production of lowquality writing where the quality of the writing itself no longer matters betrays that we are no longer a writing based civilization we just believe it's super legitimate to base Authority and writing." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=2152)

> "We forget the the idea of the sort of gentleman scholar free from worldly Affairs just trying to figure out the world right and sometimes having a big ego Isaac Newton had a big ego that didn't stop anyone from taking Isaac Newton seriously would uh Isaac Newton have done well in any sort of uh you know HR department interview horrible he would have done horribly right he he could be positively nasty it wasn't just like Aspergers right he could be viciously competitive and I think we have come to deeply disdain the kind of personality that can actually drive new ideas I think I think we have put a high premium on being very well socialized by which we mean very conflict of on the surface but perhaps very conflict oriented below the surface in our society that energy got to go somewhere it has to go somewhere in our society any sort of physical violence of course is out which sure okay that seems reasonable uh but even overly harsh scientific criticism is met with suspicion why are you upsetting the apple cart shouldn't we all be working together as a field blah blah blah blah what are we doing are we collectively preserving class privilege the class privilege of being an academic or we trying to discover truth or uh economic competition trying to do economic competition for real today will get you denounced as a ruthless businessman when it's like really well all I'm trying to do is make a good product and you know we are going to try to drive our competitors out of business if someone says that in modern corporate culture they're like what top 4 percentile top 2 percentile disagreeable among CEOs right maybe top 1% even these are all of these ways in which uh of course the fact that all of these things are punished right physical violence in intellectual competition economic competition that of course suggests there's a lot of hidden physical violence intellectual uh you know in intellectual sabotage and economic sabotage because otherwise who would be punishing them right so there's a broader theme I think of we have focused very much on eliminating outliers and we're experiencing kind of evaporative cooling in society right where over time we always Lop off the right and left side of the distribution or maybe just the right side of like a gossing distribution and you know not in a genetic or IQ sense just on on any sort of trait that we allow people of you know various positions to have and over time our sense of how what the proper social role is gets narrower and narrower and narrower and we have in the process of narrowing it cut out huge chunks of what once made it functional to be I don't know the member of a of a of a of a corporation right um a functioning board today is exotic almost dangerous almost unprecedented like a board that practices any oversight over a company that's that's weird right?" - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=2406)

> "We all basically explain away the failures of elective representatives to Institute any sort of change in purely personal terms we always talk about oh the these politicians are corrupt bad not serious co-opted by the system and so on yet obviously anyone who makes it to those positions always has those features the system and the whole set of incentives actively select for a certain kind of individual to go there but the pretense we all have is that if the right individual got in they could still do things why do we believe that why do we think that if suddenly you know a different person came into Parliament or Congress that they would be able to organize with other fellow congressmen or members of parliament and say I don't know reform the intelligence Community or reform the Pentagon or even reform either way the N NHS right in Britain I think it's very dubious that they could do that especially in the very short amount of time they have available especially with very limited resources in terms of uh uh even research capacity like how much research capacity as to all of these difficult problems that an elective representative is supposed to have a crisp opinion on how much capacity do they have who is doing that intellectual labor for them well might be lobbyists might be their political party if they're a particularly functional party but they're certainly not doing it as individuals so i' put the Tipping Point around the last time you saw saw a representative deliberative legislative body where a speech was given to other members of the elected body with the primary intent to change the opinion of fellow legislators rather than the general public now here's an interesting one we're used to debates being a circus they are there to help you be elected it is exotic and strange for us to imagine a body where the elected officials meet and they try to persuade each other of points right and actually change people's minds exactly truly yeah they're trying to change each other's minds to converge on a common truth Converge on a common truth with each of them being a representative of the interest interests of their constituents what I said sounds like Civic 101 because it is and because it's crazy to point out that's not how it works right now but the crazier thing is it kind of did work that way in 1900 1920 I would say as late as 1960 I think in 19 60 if you had a persuasive well argued speech in British Parliament or in Congress people who at that point were 70 or 60 years old uh who were not in touch with the incentives of their era they would probably behave as a real deliberative body right and I think in the United States an interesting point is the 1970s which is when Congress to some extent attempts to both reign in the president but also reign in the intelligence Community uh there's commission hearings that declassify a bunch of stuff in the United States after the Vietnam War of course the impeachment also of Richard Nixon but that's sort of the last spasm so if we were looking at us history I think you know the 1970s are a good Mark and for the United Kingdom maybe 60s maybe 70s." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=2835)

> "We have a certain time in almost every civilization's history where particular skill or particular tradition of knowledge be it military economic scientific spiritual um you know uh uh social right Urban uh we developing it is the best way to achieve success and recognition of society and the Tipping Point of diminishing returns come sooner or later right when the s-curve is exhausted and at that point you go from positive sum games to negative sum games and as soon as your civilization starts playing negative Su games that is infectious and spreads rapidly through an institution if the best way to succeed in a major government bureaucracy today is to treat it in bad faith if the best way to succeed in the media space is to treat it in bad faith if the best way to succeed in Academia is to treat it in bad faith wow we've what's left right right and I'm not even I'm not even done I could go forther right if the best way to run a startup is to treat it in bad faith and the best way to do it is to Hype it up at all times s even if you know your technical fundamentals are sketchy then you know maybe we're all become in Silicon Valley we will all become Elizabeth Holmes maybe we already become Elizabeth Holmes right and we don't even know it because who would point it out right it's just so default it is very default and that's why I think that how to break out of that as a civilization well sometimes you can take very Extreme Measures which I think can prolong the existence of a society right the creation of a completely new city that comes to be a new Elite Center is surprisingly effective why well human beings are biased against moving most Roman noble families did not want to follow Constantine and his weird bunch of religious freaks out into a random Greek city formerly Byzantium then Constantinople yet even 50 or 100 years ago they found themselves radically disempowered compared to the new uh Senate that was set up there was a separate Senate set up in Constantinople and a new military apparatus and a new taxation apparatus focused on the Eastern provinces and of course the Pagan state-backed religion gave way to the Christian state-backed religion so that was a transfer of power there there wasn't a direct fight there was just this sudden like change of where coordination happens I think cities need to be understood as like physical embodiments instantiations incarnations of coordination which street you live on shockingly important which offices are close to each other shockingly important when the US was like structured a bit more honestly there was a you know there was a department of War rather a Department of Defense and it was in the same building as the state department I guarantee you if your generals and diplomats run into each other in the hallway you will be in fewer stupid Wars as soon as you physically separate them to opposite sides of a river or opposite cities the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing and actually you might have basically exiled someone to a place of irrelevance uh it's not just you know Roman history that has this phenomena Uh Russian history has this phenomena when the Zars wanted to be absolutist in Russia and have great power over the high nobility they moved out of Moscow to St Petersburg leaving the Moscow nobility behind and irrelevant so I think I would be very optimistic if any major Western Country today created a new capital with a new University with a new special economic zone I think that would be extremely optimistic because that would mean that the old negative sum institutions are left to play their negative sum game which is self- marginalizing and you immediately are starting something that at least locally in that City can be a positive sum game." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=4038)

> "I think the space of organizing voters even the voters themselves being organized right so not even top down organization just giving voters tools for them to organize themselves massive disruption opportunities people have totally stopped talking about digital democracy and stuff like that that was very popular in the early 2000s right it's just it's gone well mostly because you can't really easily make money off of it but the positive returns to fixing a country's politics would be immense right even eventually financially like if you live in a well functioning country so many things are much easier business-wise." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=4976)

> "I think that in the past whenever you have a society trapped in negative sum games it is precisely on the creation of new social Technologies where the Hope rests for positive sum games so I think today we are hope generating enough people who have the potential to be great Founders that there will be a transformation in some sectors of our society that goes us from a losing streak where we're sort of living off our inheritance where maybe you know the numbers are still going up and maybe even the first derivative is positive but the second derivative has gotten very negative so we need to break out of that spiral uh and I think that can only happen through such individuals." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=5318)

> "We are nowhere near the frontier of crazy irresponsible people running around we are very close to saturated on extremely boring very parasitical very inactive extractive Elites right so we're close to saturation on the senescent cells we are nowhere near on saturation on like new crazy people running around." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=6274)

> "I am skeptical of the democratization of our society for a variety of reasons I think our society is very oligarchic and power has actually concentrated in these sort of like aifi stagnant non- agentic centers where the main mode of exercising power today say in the European Union or in the United States and honestly any large country is the veto in the European Union the most powerful person is a french-speaking bureaucrat in Brussels that you've never heard of who says no says no to something being done and and in the United States there are so many reasons not to do things right at the federal level at the sort of political level and we are saturated in these various Elites they are not very agentic they are powerful but because they don't do anything they just forbid things you can never call gotcha on the power we don't recognize forbidding something as an abuse of power we recognize doing something as an abuse of power in case it goes wrong yeah and that's kind of messed up definitely it's an it's an asymmetry of information essentially very fundamentally and then we were just talking about the failure of the epistemic commons I think there is no way that power is De more democratized now than it was 20 years ago because you know my phone is not my ally in making sense of the world it is actively trying to run basically scops on me at all times and all places and you know by carrying around this phone or an Apple phone if people prefer those you are basically giving away your location at all times times you are basically recording every conversation you have and while you might trust the very inert and uncreative Elites that run the big software companies or that run the government agencies that can legally demand any data your uh big software organizations have your companies your nonprofit foundations whatever uh while you might trust their inactivity the fact is you as an individual are vastly more transparent to any bureaucracy today than you were at any previous point in human history in no previous point in human history could a bureaucracy gather as much information on you as an individual as they can today and I claim that you as an individual have less of an ability to gather information on the inner working of a bureaucracy today than even 10 years ago I think even compliance with things like the Freedom of Information Act Right have been much attenuated and the idea that it is irresponsible for large bureaucracies to not keep accurate records that's sort of gone away and the software and information tools that an individual could use to study those organizations they're not been developed we've only developed ways to monetize and examine the individual we've not developed the software tools to look at large bureaucracies Argo over time large bureaucracies are more powerful than individuals and large bureaucracies unless piloted by live player so like an act agentic individual will come to be run by homeostasis seeking self-serving rent extracting oligarchies so it sounds really like what you're arguing for is we just need actually a higher complexity State we need greater risk tolerance I would say we need greater risk tolerance for reform of major government institutions and we need greater risk tolerance in terms of Industry disruption and we need greater intellectual risk tolerance where we encourage people uh to and we try to sustain them socioeconomically in developing new ideas of how nature works and how society works." - [Samo Burja](https://youtu.be/A3Zd2K0BJoI?t=6435)
