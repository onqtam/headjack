<p>Headjack is an <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640">open state database</a> designed for <a href="introduction/introduction.html#web-scale--ux">web-scale</a> social media (in the billions of users) that addresses the most fundamental pieces of the puzzle: identity, connections, names and <a href="introduction/introduction.html#addressability-hostapp-vs-dataname-centric">content addressability</a> with stable &amp; readable paths resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URNs</a> (instead of hashes) all packaged in a credibly neutral economically self-sustaining blockchain. It is <a href="introduction/introduction.html#the-ambition">aiming</a> to disaggregate the giants and end network effect monopolies &amp; data silos by aligning incentives and striking the right balance of tradeoffs - there will be no mass adoption without retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to.</p>
<p>Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs &amp; micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441">making it sovereign</a> - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="on-chain-vs-off-chain"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-vs-off-chain">On-chain vs off-chain</a></h2>
<p>Due to practical limitations it is <a href="introduction/on_off_chain.html#web-scale--ux">impossible</a> to put everything on a blockchain so we have to make a key distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity &amp; connections being the most valuable - a clear example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> (basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)">Medium</a> but you own the mailing list for your audience). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking &amp; ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681">essential crown jewel</a> that needs preservation - the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">pub-sub</a>. The data availability (DA - storage &amp; retrievability) for identity &amp; the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.</li>
<li>Content should be stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> and other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time. Most of it doesn't have to be stored forever but any piece can be backed up through third-party archival services. It gets anchored with cryptographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle roots</a> in the main chain so that permissions, inclusion &amp; sequence are provable - that way even if content goes dark it can later resurface and be deduplicated by linking it to its previous instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game theory behind why competing interfaces (presentation layers) would freely share the activity of their users with others is that if they don't they would be effectively denying reach - users would migrate to a competitor because the cost to do so is 0 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty_Model"><code>voice and exit</code></a>. Current social media platforms are monopolies because identities are not portable and the network effects are in private database silos - a problem practically insurmountable for incumbents. <a href="https://twitter.com/coconidodev/status/1504850437727571974"><code>@balajis: &quot;When identities become portable, backends become liquid&quot;</code></a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="core-idea"><a class="header" href="#core-idea">Core idea</a></h2>
<p>There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption &amp; parity on convenience &amp; UX with Web2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be scalable to billions of users and that must be <a href="introduction/scaling.html">obvious &amp; provable</a> if devs &amp; entrepreneurs are expected to jump on the opportunity.</li>
<li>Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. RSS was <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008">too technical</a> and it failed - <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss"><code>&quot;people jumped ship as soon as something better came along&quot;</code></a>. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; pass / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize interfaces to post on their behalf. Linking IDs to financial accounts on Ethereum/Solana/etc by default is misguided.</li>
<li>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data by default - costs should be shifted to services.</li>
<li>Users should be able to own their identity &amp; connections in a sovereign way with a keypair <strong>even if by default</strong> their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.</li>
<li>Anyone should be able to have an identity, operate an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> or serve media through an interface.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>There are 3 types of entities in Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>User accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, follow relationships, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing interfaces to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke that authorization).</li>
<li>Interfaces - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All follow relationships &amp; authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space. Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering &amp; exclusion of content based on its type/tag or interface that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.</p>
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/6abnkg.jpg">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to interfaces using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the interface with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/connections/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to interfaces and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an interface by saying <code>&quot;discard activity from block X forward generated through interface Y&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - in the current Web2 world we've accepted that possibility anyway.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Interfaces will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their activity will need explicit signatures - updating follow connections on-chain will be more costly because they'll take a lot more bytes but the requirement of signatures will not impact the cost of off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly connections) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be light-weight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. Their subscriptions/interests matter most, but at any point in time they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath interfaces.</p>
<hr />
<p>Think of it as an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf">information bus</a> on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self describing messages, dynamically definable message types &amp; permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity, connections &amp; authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage &amp; retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>) - durability &amp; retrievability is on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees. Another way to look at it is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network similar to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a> where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway. This is a generalization of Jack's <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">vision for decentralizing Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The internet is the computer but it's missing identity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">acls</a>&quot; - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25734612">someone</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key &amp; session management (rotation, authorization &amp; revocation) <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/key-revocation-in-self-certifying-protocols/">require</a> ordering that is <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a>. This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (<code>&quot;X follows Y&quot;</code> only affects <code>X</code>) and that is <a href="introduction/scaling.html">provable with easy to grasp napkin math</a>. It is compatible with any type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> - anything could be associated with an integer ID.</p>
<p>A key point is that in Headjack all connections in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> are asymmetric and also visible &amp; on-chain as it is geared towards <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks">public discourse</a> but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - either on-chain (although much more costly &amp; complex) or handled &amp; stored by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect. Identities will have their own customized landing pages - provided either on-chain or off-chain through an IDM - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree">Linktree</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/">valued at 1.3B$</a> and is just a bandaid for today’s fragmentation of identity on the internet.</p>

Here is <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/91513-visualizing-minute-internet-2021.html">another fascinating &amp; mind-boggling</a> yet incomplete picture of what was going on within a single minute of 2021. A peek behind what it takes to run Twitter is a good case in point: <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/10/13/why-are-facebook-digg-and-twitter-so-hard-to-scale.html">1</a>, <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2016/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-efficiency-and-optimization">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale">4</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2021/processing-billions-of-events-in-real-time-at-twitter-">5</a>. All of this infrastructure is not just about handling enormous amounts of data but also about great UX &amp; responsiveness: <code>&quot;Latency is not an option anymore&quot;</code> - Amazon <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">found</a> that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales. Google <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">found</a> an extra 500ms in search page generation time dropped traffic by 20% - 16 years ago - our irritable nature probably hasn't changed.</p>

<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="introduction/competition.html">most of the attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. We need to be realistic and focus on the essence - Headjack decentralizes only the most important part of monopolies - the identity &amp; interest graphs, and thus leveling the playing field for competition. It accomplishes this by compact graph representation and avoiding the need for keypairs &amp; signatures by default through an on-chain authorization mechanism while maintaining the optionality for anyone to be fully self-sovereign &amp; explicit - acting as a base layer for competing &amp; interoperable services. It also facilitates data-centric addressing of content under a global namespace which further disincentivizes hoarding data in silos. But Web2 isn't going anywhere - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><code>&quot;market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization&quot;</code></a> dictate that the best services will be running on huge server racks in data centers with sophisticated caches &amp; batch processing infrastructure behind familiar UX. The difference will be that users will be able to cryptographically prove content and will be able to leave any of these interfaces for better ones if their offering degrades.</p>
<p>Anyone would still be able to run software locally, interact with the ecosystem, and fetch content &amp; interactions from entities they've subscribed to (although quite bandwidth-intensive), but their experience will be extremely limited in that they won't be able to run any sort of query/filtration/feed algorithm at scale nor aggregate the activity of billions of people in real time.</p>

Moving to a data-centric model where everything is addressable under a common global namespace would force applications to be <a href="https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/">interoperable</a> - unlocking unbounded <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1451703067213066244">composability</a>.</p>
<p>Headjack <a href="https://boxkitemachine.net/posts/zero-to-one-peter-thiel-definite-vs-indefinite-thinking/">definitively</a> aims to be the backbone of the entire public web - the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a> where all content is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamper-evident_technology">cryptographically anchored</a> and totally ordered. The confluence of stable addressability &amp; indexing of information with identity, names and the interest graph results in a winner-take-all network effect with unprecedented gravity - <a href="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3527"><code>@naval: &quot;The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything&quot;</code></a>. It can succeed in completely decentralizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> and disaggregating traditional platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, YouTube &amp; Instagram through unbundling, reconstruction &amp; interoperability on top of Headjack's building blocks by mix and matching various presentation layers, architectures, business models, content moderation policies, etc. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20103-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts"><code>&quot;The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&quot;</code></a></p>
