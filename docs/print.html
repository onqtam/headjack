<p>Headjack is a blockchain that links sovereign identities to content at <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">web-scale</a>. Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation is fundamentally different from transfers and exchange of value - the design space around trust &amp; data availability for media and identity is different from finance.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
It is not about less or more trust but about better trust.

Headjack is about better trust - not trustlessness

creational - not transactional

# Motto: <s>TRUSTLESS</s> ***BETTER TRUST***

Headjack does sequencing of events.

Breaking apart identity and media allows for better incentives

it does not deal with storage and neither with routing - any kind of routing can be implemented on top of it with the advantage of addressing content in bulk or by source (publisher or creator)

 -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">UNIX philosophy</a> - in Headjack identity is simply an identifier (unique number) and anything orthogonal (KYC, profiles, privacy, finance) can be layered on top of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It solves single sign-on and allows for user experience similar to Web2 through <a href="identity.html">hierarchical authorization management</a> - keypairs are not required by default and even those with keys bound to their accounts may choose to not explicitly sign every interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consensus is reached on the absolute bare minimum - the history of authorizations, names, keys &amp; off-chain content anchors (merkle roots) - the simplest mental model for developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headjack can support <strong>billions</strong> of accounts and link <strong>unlimited</strong> amounts of off-chain activity to them. The <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">entire web</a> can be rebuilt on top of it - a claim that is <a href="numbers.html">easily provable</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="addressing.html">Content addressing</a> is with persistent &amp; human-readable URIs (instead of hashes) - the link between identity and data is cryptographically provable even if keys &amp; names have changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't deal with off-chain data storage and retrievability - those are separate problems and Headjack simply lets entities point to ways for others to retrieve addressable content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - The move from the current [host-centric](host_centric.md#the-host-centric-web--its-decay) web towards [data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing represents a paradigm shift around data ownership & access - an architectural reset of the internet. -->

<h1 id="design---guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#design---guiding-principles">Design - guiding principles</a></h1>
<p>These are the guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption of Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="principles.html#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">Web-scale, blockspace &amp; the UNIX philosophy</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">Decentralization, neutrality &amp; sovereignty</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux"><a class="header" href="#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></h1>
<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="competition.html">most of the competing attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. There are a few aspects to retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to:</p>
<img src="images/meme_make_them_learn.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 8px; width: 35%">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody wants to deal with keys, wallets &amp; self-custody because of all the headaches &amp; complexities that come along with that. Creation &amp; media are different from exchange &amp; finance and it's OK to trust by default as long as there's <a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">a fallback</a>. We should be aiming for <strong>better trust</strong> instead of trustlessness at the cost of UX. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; passwords or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize applications to post on their behalf without requiring keys &amp; signatures - by delegating trust. This way the majority of Web2 identity &amp; authentication plumbing can be reused with Headjack underneath as just another backend. <code>&quot;Sign-in with Ethereum&quot;</code> doesn't scale - we should aim for familiarity.</p>

<p>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data &amp; blockchain interactions by default - costs &amp; complexity should be abstracted away &amp; shifted to services in the background.

<p>Content addressing should be with human-friendly URIs with names &amp; numbers instead of being full of hashes - typical for Web3.

<li>
<p>All other activity &amp; data is stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> &amp; other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="identity--authorization"><a class="header" href="#identity--authorization">Identity &amp; authorization</a></h1>
<p>There are 3 types of roles in Headjack (although a single entity may play all 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing applications to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke the authorization). They will also be responsible for handling DMs as discussed <a href="IDM.html#dms">here</a>.</li>
<li>Applications - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space.</p>
<img src="images/sequenced_integer_relations.png">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; applications with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to applications using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the application with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to applications and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an application by saying <code>&quot;discard activity generated through application А from block X forward&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - it is still an enormous improvement compared to the current Web2 status quo.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Applications will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions) will need explicit signatures.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/authorizations.png">
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; Merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="images/meme_integers_and_relations.jpg">
<p>In practice, we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly authorizations) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be lightweight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. At any point in time, they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath applications.</p>

<h1 id="todays-web-host-centric"><a class="header" href="#todays-web-host-centric">Today's web: host-centric</a></h1>
<p>Today's web revolves around hosts &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast">unicast</a> communication - we query <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> to get the IP of servers and open direct connections with them to retrieve the data that they host.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;DNS was invented at nearly the beginning of the Internet itself and pre-dated the Web, and has long been a centralized registry for the identity that mapped human-readable domain names for web-sites to IP addresses.&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But domains, URI paths on servers &amp; the actual files all change &amp; go away which leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> &amp; content drift. Guidance such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">&quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;</a> is just that - guidance - and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> is just a bandaid that can hardly keep up with the digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a>. In the host-certified paradigm URLs at best point to a location at which a document may have been available at some point in time - devoid of any cryptographic proofs regarding the contents, the creator, an alternative way to retrieve it or the time of publication. The implications are explored in the <a href="host_centric.html#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">host-centric section in the motivation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="data-centric-computing"><a class="header" href="#data-centric-computing">Data-centric computing</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-centric_computing">Data-centric computing</a> is an emerging concept that has relevance in information architecture and data center design - data is stored independently of the applications, which can be upgraded without costly and complicated data migration. This is a radical shift in information systems that will be needed to address organizational needs for storing, retrieving, moving, and processing exponentially growing data sets. It increases agility by prioritizing data transfer and data computation. Applications become short-lived, constantly added, updated, or removed as algorithms come and go.</p>

<h1 id="content-addressable-storage"><a class="header" href="#content-addressable-storage">Content-addressable storage</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-addressable storage</a> (CAS) is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content (not its location/name) and is a key piece of the puzzle. Identifiers are based on content and any change to a data element will necessarily change its content address. The most famous example of CAS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> but it suffers from non-human-friendly addresses (hashes), performance issues, and extreme latency (tens of minutes) because of the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> if content is not widely cached/pinned.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">Self-authenticating data</a> moves authority from hosts to users. The three components that enable it are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic identifiers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">CAS</a>, and an emerging area of research called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> which is yet to be applied in any meaningful scale.</p>
<h1 id="information-centric-networking"><a class="header" href="#information-centric-networking">Information-centric networking</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking">Information-centric networking</a> (ICN) is an approach to evolving the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information (or content or data). Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand, and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. In information-centric networking, the cache is a network-level solution, and it has rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, and smaller cache sizes.</p>
<h1 id="named-data-networking"><a class="header" href="#named-data-networking">Named Data Networking</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking">Named Data Networking</a> (NDN) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Internet">Future Internet</a> architecture that builds on top of the previous ideas (&amp; an incarnation of ICN) and in which data is requested by name and routed by the network. However, there are many unsolved challenges with it like the need to reimplement foundational routing infrastructure to make it stateful and hierarchically structured names which require a root name authority to link them to keypairs - outside of its scope. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM">a great lecture</a> on the topic.</p>
<h1 id="enter-headjack---the-final-iteration"><a class="header" href="#enter-headjack---the-final-iteration">Enter Headjack - the final iteration</a></h1>
<p>Headjack is a weird amalgamation inspired by everything above - it provides human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> for self-authenticating data (with <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proofs</a> &amp; the blockchain) along with the means for its retrieval without forcing a specific way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> is just one option). It acts as the web-scale global index used to check the authenticity of documents (requires consulting with the chain), ownership of names, key management &amp; sequence of events throughout time. It is an addressability layer on top of the current host-centric internet technologies.</p>

<h1 id="blob-construction---batching-of-user-events"><a class="header" href="#blob-construction---batching-of-user-events">Blob construction - batching of user events</a></h1>
<p>Applications accumulate off-chain activity from users which they cryptographically anchor in batches with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> on-chain and they determine how often to do so (it doesn't have to be on every block) - those with little activity may submit only once per minute or even less often - the frequency is determined by applications based on the volume of activity and the on-chain publishing costs.</p>
<p>When enough activity has been collected it is time for the application to finalize the batch: it is packed in a blob and all the events generated since the last anchored batch are sorted &amp; grouped by accounts in some deterministic way (perhaps accounts based on index and actions based on the type/sequence) with some schema with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intra-blob index (offset table) for lookup of content of specific accounts is generated.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> that touches every event is deterministically constructed following a schema.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) for the blob is generated and it is pinned for others to download.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only 2 things that are signed &amp; submitted on-chain are thus the Merkle root and the IPFS CID for the next nonce (auto-increment counter) associated with the application account.</p>
<img src="images/blob_structure.png">
<!-- <object width=100% data="images/blob_structure.svg"></object> -->
<h1 id="stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing"><a class="header" href="#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a></h1>
<p>Applications maintain the logical order of events for the future batch in maps in order to provide intra-blob addressing even before it is fully constructed - as an example if a user posts an article and immediately after that comments on their own post - the comment should be able to refer to the post which is not yet committed on-chain. Applications will also display activity by other accounts that is not yet anchored and the interactions can still use the proper addressing when referring to the yet-to-be-anchored messages (the next nonce number is known in advance). Any type of interaction is addressable and sequenced in the blobs - including reactions (likes, etc).</p>
<h1 id="persistent--provable-uris"><a class="header" href="#persistent--provable-uris">Persistent &amp; provable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a></a></h1>
<p>Each account has an associated auto-increment counter (nonce) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content. So if an application has submitted 2 times already, then the next submission will be with <code>nonce == 3</code>. The blockchain keeps a mapping in its state for each previous nonce value to the block number when it changed so that <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> can be translated to which block has the Merkle root anchor &amp; <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> for the blob that corresponds to that nonce for that account.</p>
<!-- The 2 can be extracted from the block. -->
<img src="images/blob_URI.png">
<p>Once a blob is fetched through the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) we can address specific events by using the offset index in the blob header so a URI like <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_id&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> can point to a specific post, comment or even reaction (activity is grouped by users). The content ID for a specific user is usually a small single-digit number and is necessary only if there has been more than 1 interaction by that user through that application for the given nonce (maybe rare). This is what events with URIs referring to each other looks like:</p>
<img src="images/content_references.png">
<p>The blockchain can be queried if the application was allowed to post content on behalf of the user with an on-chain authorization (which probably happened through an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) when that specific block was published in order to determine if the activity is authentic - the state keeps information for each account such as since what block number a given application was authorized to post on behalf of a user (and until when - all ranges). Users may avoid using IDMs and explicitly sign their actions in which case their data will be accompanied by their signatures within the data blobs and the only check required will be for the user keypair used for the specific block number.</p>
<h1 id="steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri">Steps to prove the authenticity of a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap - to prove the authenticity of any event with a URI:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the data is actually part of an anchored blob with a <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proof</a> to a block. This requires either just the piece of data + a Merkle proof for inclusion in the blob or the entire blob in order to reconstruct the Merkle tree &amp; proof.</li>
<li>Then check if the user actually submitted the event:
<ul>
<li>Either if at that point the application was authorized to post on behalf of the user which would require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (authorization ranges).</li>
<li>Or by checking for an explicit signature &amp; the public key of that account at that time which would also require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (account key history).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>URIs are persistent as long as someone hosts either the individual event + the Merkle proof or the entire blob (and can reconstruct the proof) and knows to which block it was anchored (from the <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;block_number&gt;</code> mapping). The <a href="names_and_paths.html">following chapter</a> shows how names in URIs are persistent too (even if user/application names change ownership at some point).</p>
<h1 id="a-few-other-notes"><a class="header" href="#a-few-other-notes">A few other notes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>There can be many different &amp; valid proofs for the same URI from different block heights.</li>
<li>Even private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">intranet</a> data may be anchored but not retrievable by the public if the blob IPFS CID is never published or pinned/hosted - unified addressing for public &amp; private.</li>
<li>Users should be able to see the URI of content even if created through another application and the origin should be displayed by default - acting as <a href="business_models.html">attribution for other applications</a>.</li>
<li>Edits &amp; updates to content come as <a href="messages.html">messages</a> with new unique URIs that reference the older message URIs and it is up to applications to properly handle this - either by showing that there have been changes and a newer version or automatically redirect to the latest. &quot;Forks&quot; are possible but they represent application failure to detect that an old version is being edited.</li>
<li>Accounts that anchor content on-chain cannot do so twice in the same block - for simplicity.</li>
</ul>
<!--

Blob construction is a trivially parallelizable problem

# On proof permanence

One thing to consider is if a user revokes the authorization of an application to post on their behalf retroactively - not just going forward but also invalidating all anchored content & follow/unfollow events for the last couple of days through that application. This would mean that cached Merkle proofs for such invalidated content will no longer be valid and the latest state of the blockchain will refuse to produce new such proofs, but the cached proofs could mislead someone. Retroactive revocation can happen only up to `X` days to limit the scope of changes to cached proofs & what infrastructure would need to handle but still give enough time for anyone to react in case an application has posted fraudulent activity on their behalf - a **mostly theoretical concern**. Proofs for blocks older than `X` days are therefore considered permanent.

<p>Headjack is also a name registry - accounts can own a handle and be identified with it. For specifics around the details (constraints, subdomains, auctions, distribution, hoarding, leasing, etc.) please refer to <a href="handles.html">their dedicated page</a>. In this chapter:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="names-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#names-in-uris">Names in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Users and applications don't need a name and can operate as an integer index just fine, but the preferred case will be with handles. Names can change ownership but the blockchain will be able to translate <code>&lt;application_name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> with strings into the canonical integer form discussed <a href="uris.html">previously</a> by substituting the application &amp; user names with account IDs.</p>
<p>Every name has an associated auto-increment nonce (just like account IDs) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content and the blockchain records maps of <code>&lt;name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> which can then be used to resolve the URI as discussed in the <a href="uris.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>
<img src="images/account_name_state.png">
<p>But we need to be able to translate not just the application name but also the user name which may have changed ownership at any point - for that the blockchain keeps track of the account ID ownership of every name historically as ranges (from block X to block Y name N was owned by account A) so when we determine the block number for a given data blob we'd be able to check to which account ID does a name in a URI correspond to at that time.</p>
<!-- Additionally the user name <=> account ID mapping at the time of the blob could be embedded within the blob header (along with proofs) so that fewer queries are necessary to the blockchain. -->
<p>And thus we're able to have URIs such as <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> to identify any event by any actor - all we'd need to do is a few lookups and we'll be able to use Merkle proofs for any piece of content to prove authenticity. Most URIs could even omit the 4th part because probably there won't be more than 1 action by a user for a given batch by an application.</p>
<p>Note that the canonical form (numbers instead of names) of <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> could be something like <code>42/783/523/3</code> where only the last number would be the same and the nonce would most likely be different. Also <code>twitter.com</code> might no longer be owned by account <code>42</code> but what matters is that the blockchain can correctly determine who owned it at nonce <code>55212</code>. Multiple names can be owned by an account but their nonces for one event will probably be different.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri">What to ask the blockchain about a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap: we can ask the following questions about this URI: <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>To which application account ID &amp; nonce does <code>twitter.com/55212</code> correspond?</li>
<li>To which block does the applicationID/nonce map correspond?</li>
<li>What is the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> &amp; Merkle root of the anchored blob at that block?</li>
<li>What account ID does <code>johnny</code> correspond to in the block where this blob was anchored?</li>
<li>Once we download the blob or just the blob header (using the IPFS CID or any other means):
<ol>
<li>We can ask the offset table where within the blob is <code>johnny</code>'s content № <code>3</code>?</li>
<li>Once we fetch the actual data &amp; depending on whether it is explicitly signed or not:
<ol>
<li>either if the application was authorized to post on behalf of <code>johnny</code> at that time,</li>
<li>or if the signature matches the keypair that's been bound to <code>johnny</code>'s account at the time of the anchored block.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>
<h1 id="web3-uris-interoperable-in-web2"><a class="header" href="#web3-uris-interoperable-in-web2">Web3 URIs interoperable in Web2</a></h1>
<p>Application accounts can point on-chain to a host with an IP address which can be used to display content published through them. Application names can also resemble traditional domain names so it will be possible to copy-paste such URIs directly into your browser and as long as they own the same domain in the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> they should be able to serve a webpage displaying the piece of content - enabling seamless interoperability during the transition from one paradigm to the other.</p>
<h1 id="content-titles-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#content-titles-in-uris">Content titles in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Most Web3 platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1537388439259291649">suffer from unreadable URIs</a> but we've done a lot better - note the brevity and lack of hashes &amp; hexadecimal symbols (<code>0xf56a0...</code>) - in fact, this is as good as it gets...</p>
<p><strong>Or is it?!</strong> What about headlines of articles - can we have them included as well - something like <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3/how-I-went-from-vegan-to-keto-and-back-again</code>? Absolutely! The string is not at all necessary to resolve the piece of content (just like in StackOverflow where the database key for a question is just a number (example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4">question 4</a>) but the page router always changes the URL when loading the page to include the title too). <a href="messages.html">Message types</a> for posts with titles will have a dedicated field which will get included in the content hash and thus spoofing the title will be rejected by conforming applications as it would be a trivial check.</p>

<h1 id="addressing-within-content"><a class="header" href="#addressing-within-content">Addressing within content</a></h1>
<p>Different schemas could be used for addressing within pieces of content (like a paragraph from an article or a clip from audio/video - without losing the context of the whole) and message types could have by default associated on-chain schemas (or the schema of choice could be embedded within the header of the message). For example, when <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/121/66</code> is being loaded the associated schema will be looked up depending on the type of message (in this case - an article) and used to interpret the last part (<code>121/66</code>) which could mean a character selection with an offset from the start and length. The embedded schema could be overridden by explicitly stating which one to use within the URI. As an example, <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/schema/42/121/187</code> could mean <code>&quot;use on-chain schema number 42&quot;</code> which could interpret the last part (<code>121/187</code>) as start offset and end offset instead of start &amp; length - resulting in the same selection as before. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1544001073844731904">individual pages &amp; paragraphs of books</a> should be referencable in such a manner and could be composed of multiple separate posts - and this is just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>For big types of content (audio/video) the message could be broken down into chunks so that users can load only the message header and then depending on the schema used and the addressing within the content - only the necessary chunks could be requested.</p>

Why Headjack won't fall victim to stagnation and being stuck in time with this open standard and sort-of federation
https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/
- because messages will have default renderability
- because you'll always be able to click on items that your application cannot display properly and go to the application that produced them and see them properly

message type/format: price predictions with percentage possibilities, so that later reputations can be plotted based on the message type

tag type idea: prediction, and later with oracles credibility & track records could be automated

if message headers (where the URI is) also contain the content hash then one service could save only the headers & blob merkle tree without the content and then other apps that don't want to store that data but store only the actual contents could request the blob merkle proofs for a given URI
we can have a 1-of-n storage for these proofs

new types of messages get an on-chain ID so subscriptions are integer-based


messages contain their URIs and also a local timestamp - although that could be spoofed. It is however useful for ordering things in certain cases

also contain the current block height in addition to a unix timestamp

- not yet anchored content from one application can refer to other not yet anchored content from another application and then the anchors could be in such an order that an event references another event in a future block (because apps can share activity before it being anchored).
    - could this problem be ignored?




the <application_id>/<application_nonce> is embedded in a message that's being signed through an application/IDM such that it cannot suffer from a replay attack

- if a reply message has the URI to the original in non canonical form it would be harder for infrastructure to match those - it would have to translate the string URI to a number URI

- remove the focus on the interest graph - it will be off-chain!
    - also from all graphics!



ways to both use an IDM and still direct your personal perferences & private stuff to be handled by something of your choosing



1 of N requirement for keeping the interest graph intact & being able to recover it from somewhere


the graph could be moved on-chain if there are many MB/s of DB throughput (possibly sharding) but that would put a lot of strain on the 


myspace-like page  (or linktree-like) where you paint the picture of you - as a map or as whatever - but content shouldn't be owned by separate platforms


Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering & exclusion of content based on its type/tag or application that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.




In Headjack all connections in the [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) are asymmetric and also visible & on-chain as it is geared towards [public discourse](https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks) but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - handled & stored by [IDMs](IDM.md) with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) and focusing on that aspect first greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect - propagation & reach are sought after. Identities will have their own customized landing pages off-chain through an IDM.



- `follows` (`array[integer]`) - list of accounts that it follows
    - `followers` (`array[integer]`) - a list of accounts that follow it (redundant - can be reconstructed by scanning all accounts - for faster queries of the other sort)

- Twitter: 400M users (220 MAU), average connections: 700
- 1.1 TB for arrays of arrays with 4 byte integers (the graph)
    - 2.2 TB (x2) if storing connections both ways for faster lookups (who do I follow & who follows me)
    - 4.4 TB (x2) if using long long int (8 bytes) - infinite indexes
- Metadata (pubkey, handle, description) per index would be O(1)
    - Less than the bytes required for 700 connections on average
- Realistic state size: ~20TB - database overhead & merkle roots
- The entire Twitter graph can be populated in a month with 1 MB/s of blockchain bandwidth

- The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity & connections being the most valuable - a clear example is [Substack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack) (basically [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) but you own the mailing list for your audience). The [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking & ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the [essential crown jewel](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681) that needs preservation - the global [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). The data availability (DA - storage & retrievability) for identity & the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.

<p>In this chapter we will see the different aspects of handling unlimited amounts of off-chain data:</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data"><a class="header" href="#ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data">Ingestion and transformation of blob data</a></h1>
<p>Off-chain blobs with data will be fetched, processed and stored immediately after they are published in more optimal database formats for content to be later directly served by application infrastructure. Most of the cryptography checks will be happening instantly during this process but the proofs don't need to be stored. Users will always be able to request proofs for any event at any time (&amp; cache them locally) because they can be regenerated on the fly as necessary.</p>
<h1 id="hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches">Hierarchical data blobs &amp; partial fetches</a></h1>
<p>Blobs may be in a hierarchy such that the on-chain IPFS hash points only to the &quot;root&quot; blob that contains the header and the actual indexed data could be in child IPFS blobs (whose <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CIDs</a> are contained in the root blob or header) so entities listening for events by specific accounts on Headjack may download only these headers and determine which &quot;leaf&quot; blobs they need to fetch for the data they are interested in (if any). Sparse bitsets &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filters</a> could be used to quickly scan for the presence of activity by specific accounts.</p>
<img src="images/root_child_blob_separation.png">
<h1 id="direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling"><a class="header" href="#direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling">Direct IPFS connections &amp; horizontal scaling</a></h1>
<p>Applications can advertise the multiaddress of their IPFS nodes on-chain so that each blob of content that gets published can be downloaded by others instantly by manually connecting with IPFS’s <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/speeding-up-ipfs-pinning-through-swarm-connections-b509b1471986">“swarm connect” functionality</a> - avoiding the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> for each new blob CID which may take tens of minutes. They can provide addresses to multiple IPFS nodes as a cluster for horizontal scaling and use <a href="https://ipfscluster.io/">Pinset orchestration</a> - designed for Automated data availability and redundancy.</p>
<p>Applications may choose not to use IPFS at all - what they must do is anchor their blobs with a Merkle root and provide some on-chain advertised means to retrieve the data (example: REST/RPC endpoints in their on-chain account). We expect that IPFS will be the lowest common denominator and will always be used no matter what other solutions are also available.</p>
<h1 id="sharing-data-before-anchoring-it"><a class="header" href="#sharing-data-before-anchoring-it">Sharing data before anchoring it</a></h1>
<p>Applications can talk to each other directly by using their on-chain advertised REST/RPC endpoints and may ask for the events &amp; messages that are not yet published by the other applications. This way they could display &quot;remote&quot; events locally while they are still in the &quot;mempool&quot; and allow their own users to interact with those events from other applications. This is possible because URIs are stable even before publication - see <a href="blobs_and_uris.html#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a>. High activity applications can interoperate and no longer be a slave to the block time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications should display events that are not yet anchored in the UI differently - especially if coming from another application.</li>
<li>Events that refer to each other but are from different applications and have not yet been anchored on-chain could end up committed in the wrong order (if one of the applications skips a few blocks and commits at a later one) - such that an event from the past is referring to an event from the future - breaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">referential integrity</a>. However, <a href="messages.html">messages</a> have a timestamp field and could also have the current block height at the time of creation - useful for sorting.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri"><a class="header" href="#how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri">How to retrieve data for a random URI</a></h1>
<p>There are multiple options:</p>
<!-- TODO:
"The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages." ===> SHOULD BE ALSO ABLE TO ASK THE IDM OF THE USER !!! -->
<ul>
<li>The entire original blob with an <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> might still be retrievable from the original application account that posted it or anyone else that has pinned the data.</li>
<li>The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages.</li>
<li>Other well-known players without a direct on-chain connection to the application/user in a URI could be asked if they have the content:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure companies that do the heavy lifting for applications and store everything.</li>
<li>The analog of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> in this ecosystem that also stores everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPFS can be forked &amp; reused with the following change: instead of delivering content based on the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a> hash it can deliver the data + the necessary proofs based on Headjack URIs or their hash (they are unique) - any individual off-chain message that's been anchored would be retrievable as long as someone is hosting it in this p2p network (which needs bootstrapping - could be part of Headjack nodes). However, this won't be very performant due to the granular nature of individual messages with a URI and the use of a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>.</li>

Look at ethereum block & state structure
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/


with small pieces of data the proofs for them could be orders of magnitude bigger - with Headjack storing them is not necessary as they can be derived from the original data blobs and the current state of the chain - a small core capable of producing the proofs for unlimited amounts of off-chain content

== there are 2 aspects when linking identity to a piece of data:

- merkle proof linking the data to a block
    - entities needs to keep either:
        - the full IPFS blobs and no merkle trees - can reconstruct a merkle proof for any piece of data at any time
        - or just the parts they care about + merkle proofs for each part to link them to a block
            - for multiple pieces of data can be optimized with merkle pollards and/or (sparse) multiproofs
    - if the state doesn't keep historical mapping of block numbers & identities to IPFS hashes:
        - there needs to be a merkle proof within the block
- merkle proofs linking identities to authorized services or keypairs at a specific block height




if the history of key rotations & revocations is not guaranteed, then data cannot be self-authenticating

events must be self-authenticating - and not requiring that the source (original creator) be always around to provide proofs for their authenticity.





- Graph with the proofs for a URI



TODO cache the merkle root & IPFS CID from blocks in the state?


if the blockchain doesn't store the full history of authorizations & keys forever then state merkle proofs will have to be saved at some point

# Block structure

- Transactions (token transfers)
- Registration/updates of applications
    - Sources for ephemeral content generated on the application - IPFS, Ceramic, HTTPS, etc.
- Blobs of data from each separate application
    - Follow/unfollow events
    - Update/delete account info/handle
    - Merkle root of all new content generated by the application
- Root hash of the state (connections, applications & accounts)



# What is in a block

- account actions
    - token transfers
    - IDM-like:
        - create new accounts without a keypair
        - binding & updating keypairs (changes require signature from the previous key)
        - list of application authorizations & revocations for accounts that it controls (each of which is just an integer pair - `56 => 661`)
    - Application-like:
        - content blob Merkle root
        - content blob IPFS CID
        - list of follow/unfollow actions for accounts (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
        - Application-related info updates
            - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
            - keypair updates


- IDM batches
    - list of application authorizations & revocations (integers pairs - `56 => 661`)
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - keypair binding & changes (changes require signature from the previous key)
    - IDM-related info updates
- Application batches
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - content Merkle root
    - content blob IPFS CID 
    - Application-related info updates
        - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
        - keypair updates
- State root - the Merkle root for the latest materialized state

In reality a single account may play [all 3 roles](identity.md) - normal user, IDM & Application, so end users may even authorize applications & post content themselves as long as they have a keypair & the funds to pay for their direct on-chain transactions. The distinction here is to help paint the picture.

# Materialized state

For Headjack the state throughout history is much more important when compared to financial applications because there will be much more queries to prove things in the past (again and again) compared to just the present. Also, because 


TODO: does the state actually need to contain the historical mapping? not necessarily as third-party services could be doing that, but forcing full nodes to do it properly in the state & maintaining consensus would simplify the architecture of the rest


TODO: need examples & specifics for how big URI proofs would be


Make a graph with a block and txs and merkle roots




An account has the following properties:
- `ID` (`integer`) - unique on the blockchain, autoincrement, starting from 1
- `sig` - cryptographic address & signature
    - can be null ONLY if an `acm_id` is present
- `acm_id` (`integer`) - ACM ID - which [ACM](acm.md) can grant access to [applications](applications.md)
    - can be null ONLY if a `sig` is present

Other less important fields:

- `block_created` (`integer`) - in which block was the account first created

<h1 id="how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction"><a class="header" href="#how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction">How big is a Headjack transaction</a></h1>
<p>Applications post anchors to off-chain content with an IPFS CID hash and a merkle root. IDMs also anchor off-chain content (mainly user preferences &amp; updates to social graph), but they also post authorizations to other accounts (applications) to post on behalf of users as integer pairs.</p>
<p>So the fields for a transaction by an application/IDM (which will be the majority) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>version: <code>4 bytes</code></li>
<li>signature: <a href="https://ethvigil.com/docs/eth_sign_example_code/#recovering-the-message-signer-in-the-smart-contract"><code>65 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob IPFS address: <a href="https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid/01"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob merkle root: <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/merkle-tree-merkle-root-explained/"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>nonce: <code>4 bytes</code> auto-increment integer associated with the account - to prevent reordering of anchored off-chain blobs (which would mess up internal addressing based on that nonce)</li>
<li>value: <code>4 bytes</code> amount of native token paid to validators for transaction inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>So far that is <code>141 bytes</code> which almost every transaction by an application or IDM contains. IDMs also submit a list of authorizations (or revocations) as integer pairs. For example, 1000 accounts authorizing 15 different applications to post on their behalf would be 1000 integer pairs. Assuming 8 byte integers (up to 2^64) that would be 8 * 2 * 1000 = 16k bytes.</p>
<h1 id="naive-scenario"><a class="header" href="#naive-scenario">Naive scenario</a></h1>
<p>The initial version will target block bandwidth of up to 100 kb/s.

<p>Assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 MB block size &amp; 10 second block time (100 kb/s of block bandwidth)</li>
<li>1000 applications posting in every block</li>
<li>100 IDMs authorizing as much users as possible - filling the remaining block space</li>
<li>no on-chain actions such as keypair &amp; name changes, account creation &amp; direct interaction with the chain by end users</li>
</ul>
<p>We get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1100 actors (1000 applications + 100 IDMs) that post in every block at least <code>141</code> bytes for their transactions, which is <code>155100</code> bytes</li>
<li>the remaining <code>893476</code> bytes (1048576 (1MB) - 155100) can be filled with authorizations and since an authorization is <code>16</code> bytes (8 * 2) that would be 55842 authorizations/revocations every 10 seconds or 5584 authorizations/revocations per second</li>
<li>for 1 billion accounts that would be 0.557 authorizations/revocations per person per day which is actually quite good - people on average do way less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-ons</a> per day</li>

<p>The naive scenario does not include on-chain actions for specific accounts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>keypair changes (new pubkey (32 bytes) + signature (65 bytes) if there is an older key)</li>
<li>account creation (if done by an IDM then this is just a few bytes - no pubkey)</li>
<li>name registration &amp; ownership changes (see the <a href="handles.html">dedicated page</a> for more details)</li>

<li>Only a % of all accounts will have keypairs (even though 100% could) and will make just a few signed actions per year - leaving most block throughput for authorizations through IDMs.</li>
<li>Large % of accounts will rarely even be authorizing new applications - many people don't sign in to new services through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> every single day. There could also be 2 types of log-ins: passive (viewing only - nothing on-chain) and authorized (allowing services to post on behalf of users).</li>
<li>Many applications that don't generate a lot of off-chain activity will publish less often than on every block in order to minimize on-chain block space costs.</li>

<!-- 

The growth of the chain and the state will differ by a few things:


One difference between Headjack and financial blockchains is that they don't force historical records into the state whereas that is the main value proposition of Headjack.



This is a solution that is provably possible and better and can only get better in time with further innovation and scaling


The goal is to avoid congestion and provide enough bandwidth in a predictable way for web scale



This could be a concern when Headjack takes over the world - if blocks are 10 mb once every 10 seconds the chain would grow by 86 gb/day. However, 

The processing of the state machine is minimal - orders of magnitude less complexity & compute compared to generalized smart contract platforms

The state growth will be slower than the blockchain growth because:

- an on-chain authorization is a pair of integers while only 1 integer goes into the state


goal: no congestion


a tiny core on which we have consensus can be used to cryptographically anchor & link unlimited amounts of data - the entire web - a few terabytes (tiny is relative - compared to the data) of materialized blockchain state including the absolute bare minimum of historic.

- state doesn't need to store the merkle roots & IPFS hashes - merkle proofs can contain block numbers & block hashes -->
<p>TODO: light clients? in addition to merkle proofs for inclusion of content they would need merkle proofs for the state of which applications a user has authorized to post on their behalf in a given block</p>

<h1 id="off-chain-content"><a class="header" href="#off-chain-content">Off-chain content</a></h1>
<p>There are no limits for off-chain content as it is all just anchored with merkle roots - it could be as high as hundreds of terabytes per second. There isn't a more minimal design that can link unbounded amounts of off-chain data to billions of identities that can change keys &amp; names and yet still provide the guarantees &amp; mental model simplicity of Headjack - it achieves consensus on the absolute bare minimum.</p>
<!-- validium

This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (`"X follows Y"` only affects `X`) and that is [provable with easy to grasp napkin math](numbers.md).

data availability guarantees don't need to be as strong as for finance - it won't be fatal to revert a few blocks of activity if data is unavailable -->

avoiding signatures by default - only hashing - much faster
asymmetric cryptography is SLOW
https://medium.com/logos-network/benchmarking-hash-and-signature-algorithms-6079735ce05
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/38043/hmac-vs-rsa-speed

bloat because of individual signatures - versus computable hashes that don't need to be stored

DA is very important for DID resolution - if there's no guaranteed DA - there's no guaranteed resolution.


authentic timestamps?

how easy it is to build aggregators for the entire public web?

are applications bottlenecked by the personal data repository of a user? yes in the case of farcaster & bluesky

re-read this about farcaster:

TODO: read these about farcaster
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz

Order of data determined by the URI as a line

Value capture potential as a line

discoverability

bluesky - dependence on DNS

row: type of account key or joinability or compactness of key: number or (hash of) public key - only farcaster green besides headjack

Competition - 1-of-N

Storage agnostic or opinionated in table

protocol-first vs app-first

farcaster - "text-centric social network"

4. I wonder what the team will do for authentication and authorization? Will they go the ACL route? (In which case, are they going to include Solid-style client identity, in the ACLs?) Will they go the capabilities route? (UCANs / zCaps). This is the genuine hard part.



Having the app id and doing batch commitments simplifies routing and aids self-authenticity for documents

names are worthless if they aren't in URIs pointing to documents

The winner take all singleton is the easiest mentally

having everything from a user in a tree with a root hash - easier replication

farcaster is a specific social networking protocol that is trying to also handle consistency & conflicts - like not allowing double liking of a post by a specific user, etc.

Their product-led protocol development strategy means they need to chase product-like targets when designing a foundational protocol. Following [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

!!!!!

Farcaster can be entirely rebuilt on top of Headjack but not everything that Headjack enables can be built on top of Farcaster.

product-led protocol development
https://chapterone.substack.com/p/farcaster-the-new-crypto-gtm

https://chapterone.substack.com/i/77871905/product-led-protocol-development
No - product-led protocol development is rarely the best way forward if you get the foundations wrong - iterating out of a local maximum may prove impossible and kill the product. Once there is a yet-unsustainable product that requries money, there is also a timer that is ticking.

With Farcaster, content is directory-certified and cannot be fully self-authenticating because if the directory to which the on-chain account points to goes away - so does the credibility for any piece of data by that account - no way to cache proofs. Furthermore, directories can be tampered with and currently it's up to the p2p network to keep track if any malicious changes happen



farcaster - their model can work even without the p2p nodes - aggregators can be built that talk directly to host directories

farcaster can be built on top of Headjack but not everything that can be built on Headjack can on Farcaster

Farcaster is the best team in the space.

<p>Their architecture: <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol">link</a>. The account registry is on a blockchain and everything else is off-chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registry on Ethereum L1 - for new accounts, name/host changes &amp; key management.</p>
<ul>
<li>No plans on moving to an L2 or their own chain. Also, state rent could eventually be introduced to Ethereum which would lead to further costs &amp; complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keypairs &amp; wallets required - harder mass adoption. Authorizations still <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#45-signer-authorizations">require a signature from the root key</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocations invalidate all prior activity from a delegate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, this means that all messages signed by that signer will be lost since we cannot tell which ones were signed by the attacker.&quot; - <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#71-signer-compromise">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#46-root-signer-revocations">Root signer revocations</a> are even more impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - Cast timestamps are self-reported and can be manipulated - no true cryptographic total ordering - which leads to a lot of complexity in the node software. Not sure what happens to old casts that were signed with obsolete keypairs and how the history of keys is handled. -->
<!-- message ordering, timestamps & authenticity can be manipulated which requires more logic in the software to keep track of previous hashes
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#message-ordering -->
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#5-peering">p2p network</a>'s ability to scale by passing around granular casts is questionable - they are already discussing possible flooding and nodes having to shadow ban and flag accounts based on behavior.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: problem with farcaster - you cannot save content from others forever with authentic proofs if the person removes completely their history of key changes & content signatures. Correct? -->
<!-- Directly polling accounts & their hosts for new events is more scalable but has tradeoffs compared to broadcasting messages & ingesting them into DBs & indexes (pull vs push). -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus is on <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#47-sharding">partial views of the network</a> as opposed to mass scale aggregation &amp; indexing - although that could easily be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/pull/1/files">Cast URIs</a> will look something like <code>farcaster://id:8789213729/cast:0xf00b4r</code> which is less readable than what Headjack will be offering with <a href="addressing.html">its addressing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall good intuition about the concept of <a href="https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks">sufficient decentralization</a> (putting only what is absolutely necessary on a blockchain) but the p2p node implementation takes on too much <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#7-security-considerations">responsibility, complexity &amp; assumptions</a> (consensus, CRDTs, trees, ordering, flooding &amp; replay attacks, etc.) and is lacking in other areas.</p>

<p>Frequency (a Polkadot parachain) is the first implementation of DSNP (Decentralized Social Networking Protocol - <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>) as a standalone blockchain and has had the most influence over Headjack's design but the two have diverged in some key respects - the biggest of which are scalability, content addressability, UX &amp; choosing Polkadot. Some of the problems with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No names within the project - just integer IDs for accounts. Content addressing URIs are based on hashes without connection to the batch # / service that published it - example: <code>dsnp://78187493520/0x1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</code> (<a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identifiers.html#dsnp-content-uri">source</a>). Addressing content is much worse compared to Headjack's <a href="addressing.html">human-readable &amp; persistent URIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegating applications to be able to post on behalf of users (analogous to authorization in Headjack) happens on-chain but requires a signature from the user (bulky - limiting throughput). New applications (&amp; revocation) require the user to have access to their keys. Hierarchical delegation would allow for UX comparable to Web2 and would even allow for users without keypairs at all but DSNP doesn't have that - Headjack does. <!-- https://discord.com/channels/969001918460469250/969308056208961606/996417552962043924 --></p>

deleting an old post requires re-merkleization of the tree

competition page: batching & compactness (FC does have some fancy hub sync)

farcaster is too opinionated

Key rotation in competition - for lens perhaps account abstraction would help

Farcaster: with or without CRDTs you should be processing everything anyway, and with a simple fork choice rule you wouldnt need crdts

identifier type in the table - integer or hash of public key - in competition table

Farcaster - when there isnt a grand vision outsiders implement twitter interface clones with some differences in coloring and layout. And thats it.



In int64 we trust - with an oreol
Joinability
You can stuff integers in bitmaps and check for intersections - hashes suck
Anything not built around integers is disqualified due to joinability & maskability

Twitter’s servers cost 1.5 billion per year - we need to engineer for web-scale

https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1605448752881229824

Simplifying joining is killer f

Add joining in the pitch


Farcaster arent thinking bih enough - crdts are a crutch - an unnecessary constraint

Anything without built-in incentives is not suitable as a foundation


Guaranteed resolvability

Signing with a private ley requires it to always be loaded - for every new event
Contrast that to auth tokens - they are created once and reused many times - only the point of creation needs the highest security



with farcaster all the activity of a user is chained linearly & merklized and that means there's a bottleneck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVI2uKgHtY
although that does solve problems that are present in headjack...


Farcaster blocktime - slow but very rarely needed

on Nostr
https://twitter.com/pippellia/status/1605970256807206912



In case an IDM or application is compromised (but not their keys - only the servers to some extent) it could invalidate all access tokens with a single compact range message - not individually

farcaster - limits on the number of signer keys, also what is the revocation process like?

designing from first principles - what needs to be decentralized? what's the common use case for 99.9% of cases? what are the guarantees we should provide - and nothing less?
headjack is an exercise in minimalism

> "Computer scientists, faced with the challenge of scaling, tend to fall back on a hierarchical scheme." - [source](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1127699384102080514)

> "We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection." - [The fundamental theorem of software engineering (FTSE) by Andrew Koenig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering)


in entity resolution (if records from different data sources represent the same entity) consistency & latency are key, and so is brevity/compactness


timestamped events?
    farcaster - no, user reported timestamp
    "Delta timestamps can be used by applications when generating feeds of information for their users. Such timestamps are untrustworthy since they are user reported and the network cannot verify them. The timestamp trust model is like that of a blog where most users tend to be well behaved since a monitoring service at the application level can be used to detect timestamp abuse."

App id/name in URIs for content generated through them

proofs for the authorization or key ownership at the point of publication are not necessary! they can be reconstructed !!!

infra need to store signatures & proofs?

upper limit for total data on the network/protocol






- competition - finish it !!!

    - Point when comparing with others: multiple ways to ask for data from an URI as opposed to just a hash
    - a URI is not connected to multiple entities and not just a hash - the application & user
    - Others con - addressability does not include application names - no such direct client attribution mechanism
    
    - just because you can interlink everything with hashes doesn't mean that you should



    - page about the key rotation & anchoring problem and where does the key rotation & revocation data live & latencies? - aka WHY SEQUENCE THIS


ANCHORING IS NOT ENOUGH! - you need to know which event invalidated the previous one without having to check if it was invalidated

ordering guarantees?

Pruned sets - how/which data is stored by hubs
The protocol is trying to do too much
Very opinionated - way beyond just decentralized identity
the hub implementation has a lot of tough choices to make in regards to rate limiting, spam & storage limits/guarantees
there is a consensus algorithm about 
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj

farcaster makes the hubs a bottleneck for applications - instead of allowing different apps to provide their own storage

All this complexity of sets, CRDTs, pruning & size limitations stems from the inability to address content by users without it being created by the hub - a user's hub is a bottleneck for applications
What is a [CausalRemovesWinIfValid](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj) set?

> "We expect users to resign their messages when migrating between clients" - [source](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HJzK5VM4o)
wow...
"When a signer is removed, all messages signed by it present in other CRDT's must now be considered invalid and evicted from those CRDTs."
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#72-signers
however, even a custory address may change but it may re-authorize signers.
but if a signer was compromised you have to lose everything signed by it

A negative for headjack is that it's not trivial to obtain the latest version of a document for a URI - if it was deleted you'd probably need to ask the app or the IDM of the user if they have an update, but that update could have been submitted by another app



Without anchoring data with a Merkle proof and sequencing that in time, it is impossible for a document to be fully self-authenticating because it might have been signed with keys that have been compromised/revoked/rotated.

Encoding metadata in the uri avoids the need for requests


A single on-chain message that updates an rpc/rest endpoint can redirect trillions of URIs and exabytes of data instantly - no global DHT used for individual elements

When a key is rotated it doesn’t affect old content for it to be self-authenticating

Insight: names are most useful when in document URIs - not used to identify your personal finances publicly

just like we need IP over MAC addresses in order to have a hierarchy, for the same reason we need Headjack URIs on top of hashed data - the retrievability process is greatly improved

benefit: no need to store proofs for every single event as they can be derived

flexibility - addressing is forever - but the storage & architecture of any application can be changed - without breaking the addressing.

Farcaster focuses on eventual consistency with CRDTs & Delta Graphs but the elephant in the room is different counts based on different filters which cannot be done with CRDTs easily.
ACTUALLY not sure if that's true :|
but perhaps CRDTs are just not as performant for trillions of likes
Our view is that using CRDTs is a constraint - like for example multi-dimensional follows with include/exclude filtering
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#3-delta-graph

limits on data? size & retention?
CRDTs are a limit for Farcaster.
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#33-bounding-graph-size
https://hackmd.io/fCa8_RCEQ4qBYZjfnas9Zg



partial view of the network allowed?
    not for farcaster

Why go theough the trouble of dealing with crdts and constrains if youll solve just one basic case and not everything thats possible?


They aim for Hubs to have a complete view of the network and are aiming for everything to fit in 64TB o_O

"we limit users to storing a finite number of deltas for each type and calculate the limits to keep the size of the graph under 64 TB."




farcaster is too constraining because of the use of CRDTs
The system cannot be extended by anyone because the Hubs need to agree to run the software that handles any new message type. The protocol is tied to the infra.


Farcaster: a lot of complexity, a lot of limitations and no clear path to being general purpose & web-scale




integer keys as opposed to hash-based keys - so that filtering is easy - by and/or-ing bitmaps
this goes in competition table!

hash-based intra-PDR addressing - could get very bloated

if a user's PDR goes away all cached documents are no longer linkable to their identity

- **Consortium** of nodes & a transparency log manage the DID registry.
    - Centralization point (not just [logical](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)) - users can be kicked off.
    - This should have been a credibly neutral & self-sustaining blockchain.

- Requires the use of keypairs which is worse UX compared to Headjack and would hinder mass adoption - although they do talk about [custodial solutions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/docs/#root-private-key-management).

- When users post content they update their Personal Data Repositories managed by their Personal Data Servers (PDS) which play somewhat similar roles to [Farcaster](#farcaster)'s managed hosts and Headjack's [IDMs](IDM.md).

- Users can lose their interest graph if the PDS they are using loses their data.

- The Personal Data Repositories would be a lot less compact than Headjack because accounts and links between them are not simple integers and every piece of data and relationship comes along with a signature.

Overall a solid effort and could work - some similarities to [Farcaster](#farcaster) but the DID registry is centralized by a consortium and the usernames are email-like (DNS - centralization point) instead of handled by the DID registry. Neither solution anchors content like Headjack does. -->

<p>Google is way more than just a search engine even though the majority of their revenue comes from advertising - they control large percentages of the plumbing of the web - key choke points such as submarine cables, routing, data centers, browsers, DNS, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidVorick"><code>David Vorick</code></a> puts this perfectly into perspective in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486"><code>The Worrying Depth and Scope of Censorship on the Internet</code></a> - some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.&quot;</p>

<p>Frontend code served by applications can be published and have its own URI.

This way presentation layers could be cached locally and in a distributed way with proofs for authenticity - improving redundancy, latency, and throughput. Checking for a newer version would be a small query to the chain if there is a new URI - version control for frontends. This can work even for more dynamic applications that serve different versions depending on region/locale or which are A/B testing - the dynamic part could be served from a centralized host while smaller chunks of code could be referenced through URIs.</p>

We could establish global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) through authenticity, reputation, and the ledger of record.

Another important aspect in improving coordination is to build applications that will help in forming common knowledge:

<p>Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have &quot;fallback&quot; translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don't support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema <code>42</code> can have the following template for serialization: <code>&quot;{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}&quot;</code>, and thus a basic application that encounters <code>{message_type: &quot;42&quot;, asset: &quot;$BTC&quot;, date: &quot;2025.02.12&quot;, above_or_below: &quot;above&quot;, price: &quot;100000$&quot;, probability: &quot;80%&quot;}</code> could render <code>&quot;$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12&quot;</code>. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there's no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.</p>
<p>The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.</p>
<!-- Perhaps the reputation system can be abused - by making 100 accounts and building different prediction timelines throughout time and then using only the winners - this page should be treated just as a starting point and isn't trying to provide all the answers. -->

<p>&quot;Finally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust. Self-authenticated data can retain metadata, like who published something and whether it was changed. Reputation and trust-graphs can be constructed on top of users, content, and services. The transparency provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced.

<p>The biggest hurdle for its adoption has been the <a href="host_centric.html#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">host-centric</a> paradigm and the hoarding of data in silos with no incentive for exporting &amp; interoperability - Headjack changes that through <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">data-centric addressing</a> &amp; broadcasting by default. While there will always be companies that enrich &amp; tag data privately with their own ontologies and vocabularies to construct knowledge graphs for themselves, with open data by default and persistent URIs that always point to the same documents anyone will be able to broadcast similarly annotated versions of content with new URIs and relate them to the originals in a stable way for reuse by others. We can give birth to the public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph">Giant Global Graph</a> outside of large centralized systems such as Google and Facebook. Machine learning for processing unstructured data has its place but it can only go so far - structuring through the use of different <a href="messages.html">message types</a> and further annotations will make everything a lot more machine-readable.</p>

<p>&quot;In the long term vision, thinking in terms of the graph rather than the web is critical to us making best use of the mobile web, the zoo of wildy differing devices which will give us access to the system. Then, when I book a flight it is the flight that interests me. Not the flight page on the travel site, or the flight page on the airline site, but the URI (issued by the airlines) of the flight itself. That's what I will bookmark. And whichever device I use to look up the bookmark, phone or office wall, it will access a situation-appropriate view of an integration of everything I know about that flight from different sources. The task of booking and taking the flight will involve many interactions. And all throughout them, that task and the flight will be primary things in my awareness, the websites involved will be secondary things, and the network and the devices tertiary.&quot; - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160713021037/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/215#:~:text=In%20the%20long,the%20devices%20tertiary.">Giant Global Graph, Tim Berners-Lee</a></p>

<p>ontology/taxonomy vs the knowledge graph
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rn3P-RlN3s</p>
<p>accounts have their own concept/noun space with identifiers from 1 and upwards
others can define ontologies that use those concepts
others can make equivalence maps between ontologies &amp; concepts</p>
<p>Social media 1.0 is a capitalistic artifact of gradient descent. Social media 2.0 is the Metaverse where data has no boundries</p>
<p>What if wikipedia was a common knowledge graph with different possible views for it?
Wikipedia 2.0 will be a crowdsourced knowledge graph</p>
<p>with common shared knowledge graphs we could do impact analysis for event prioritization and also root cause analysis and other graphs that perhaps represent someone's essay/thoughts could refer to the main shared graph - acting as an extension to it that can be considered in the context of the whole &amp; analyzed</p>
<p>the semantic web is about replacing the statistical ranking and sporadic links in the web with something actually meaningful and unambiguous &amp; semantic</p>
<p>not facts/concepts/rules - assertions!</p>
<p>what if we could crowdsource something like Cyc?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwYaj-1EVJ0</p>
<p>the semantic web was held back by the host-centric model and the lack of stable decentralized identities to which we could link/join data</p>
<p>reviving the semantic web</p>
<p>example: schema.org and their &quot;identifiers&quot; for relationships:
https://schema.org/knows
but this could be just 2 numbers: 1234:651</p>
<p>Episodes &amp; other creations should get their concept id</p>
<p>The RDF format &amp; the use of URIs means that most keys are long strings beholden to the host-centric model</p>
<p>Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.</p>
<p>Due to the scale-free effect there will be a power law distribution for the IDs being used - there will be a convergence - just like imdb movie ids are used in many places</p>

<p>open graph protocol is an extremely simple ontology for semantic data
The embedded facebook like button in external pages makes use of OGP and is the largest generator of RDF triplets out there. The more you've annotated the content - the easier it is for Facebook to make sense of the data.
There's a difference from &quot;they liked something on that page&quot; from &quot;they liked this specific shoe from a store sold by X&quot;
With OGP, only entities like Facebook and the website owner get the structured data - with Headjack such public actions could be available for anyone to use - we'd get a lot more innovation &amp; experimentation in algorithms that make use of the public data</p>
<p>The semantic web on top of extremely long &amp; verbose host-centric URIs was bad</p>

<li><strong>Social graph</strong> (or interest graph) - your connections &amp; subscriptions</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong> (+ browser extensions)

<li><strong>Functional</strong> - filters, blocked accounts, choice of recommendation algorithm, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> of what's been viewed/visited - 2 types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser</strong> history (can be synced across devices with cloud accounts)</li>
<li><strong>App-specific</strong> history (YouTube has a watched videos list but Twitter has no such thing)
<ul>
<li>playback progress is a special type of app-specific history - YouTube &amp; Spotify store &amp; show it for any item (but not which parts of the timeline have been viewed (like a barcode) - and thus moving the playback cursor changes your &quot;progress&quot;)</li>

<p>What if we could choose the visibility of any action? We could set different defaults for any of them, have the ability to override it for any individual item and even have an account-wide visibility toggle between public &amp; private - similar to when you open an incognito browser window and (hopefully) not have any of your history recorded &amp; correlated with your identity. This might not always be a good idea (users might mess up and make something public by accident), but it should be possible and we have already learned using incognito windows as a pattern - such shifts are possible.</p>
<p>But why would we want this flexibility? A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong>: individuals &amp; streamers who are digging into something might want to make their digital trail for a browsing session public &amp; more easily accessible, analyzable &amp; followable.</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could &quot;follow&quot; those of others - adopting changes automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could aggregate and analyze the shifts in public preferences throughout time - enabling better and more organic discoverability of tools and settings.</li>
<li>Both <strong>history</strong> and <strong>settings &amp; preferences</strong> can be shared not just publicly but also selectively with entities so that we can monetize our own data. Currently our behavioral patterns are closed &amp; being data mined by companies which make decisions in their own best interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The freedom to share is a form of expression and agency - we should have granular control. A key piece of the puzzle is moving away from the host-centric web by linking data to identity so that it can be seamlessly exported and addressed in a uniform way.</p>
<!-- For the fully private actions there is a 3rd axis - local or in the cloud, but we won't look into that here. -->

<p>██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████</p>
<p>Today's form of relationships in social media are too simplistic - you either follow someone or you don't. Apps like Instagram don't even have the distinction between a connection (friendship) and a follow - you can't have access to someone's private photos without also following them (at least Facebook has this distinction). This is by design - the less control you have over what activity ends up in your feed - the more engaging the app and the better for them. They're also leveraging social pressure by showing explicitly if someone is following you: <code>&quot;How come you're not following me?&quot;</code> - you can't have a private follow in Instagram and that's on purpose (at least you can in Facebook). YouTube subscriptions became a mere hint to the recommendation algorithm over time because the platform knows better where your attention should be spent - that's why creators have been nudging users to also <code>&quot;hit the bell icon&quot;</code> - a harder &amp; more explicit form of subscription.</p>
<p>We are complex beings with different interests &amp; aspects to our personalities - that's why there are many many apps to address different needs &amp; verticals: Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Goodreads, Medium, Quora, StackExchange, etc. We are multidimensional:</p>
<img src="images/multidimensionality_cropped.png">
<p>But that comes at a cost: fragmented identity, duplication &amp; lack of composability. What if everything was built on top of a single unified identity network shared and reused across apps with granular subscriptions (following) for what we want to be notified for and see from others - with the ability to control the visibility of our preferences? The ultimate subscription network:</p>
<!--
TODO:
add tiny designs/screenshots for the different ideas - like a multi-level tree for subscriptions and how you could be partially subscribed to someone
-->
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;follow&quot;</code></li>
<li>explicitly include/exclude based on:
<ul>
<li>application source - <code>&quot;I want everything from account A from app B&quot;</code></li>
<li>content type - <code>&quot;I want every picture from account A from any app&quot;</code></li>
<li>custom filters (contains <code>&quot;X&quot;</code> word)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>what if you could define additional filtering criteria for sources - like anything that doesn't contain the word &quot;X&quot;</p>
<p>YouTube channels have RSS feeds. If you subscribed to one with an RSS reader you might have noticed that that <code>#shorts</code> are given to you along with normal videos. We should be able to filter that out. Take for example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnchainedPodcast">@UnchainedPodcast</a> - this is their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWiiMnsnw5Isc2PP1to9nNw">RSS feed</a> and it has everything in there - and we have no easy way to filter it.</p>
<p>InoReader for example allows you with a paid feature to construct rules for subcriptions such as &quot;mark as read anything that contains the string #shorts&quot; - we can have this, but generalized and for anything</p>
<p>When you show your Attention (what algorithms, apps &amp; settings you're using, &amp; even your history) you get attention for it - in regards to the signaling</p>
<h1 id="notifications--subscriptions"><a class="header" href="#notifications--subscriptions">Notifications &amp; subscriptions</a></h1>
<p>Twitter decided that it needs to boost engagement and forced &quot;recent tweet&quot; notifications on us <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qwvhhb/how_do_you_disable_recent_tweets_from_x/">without the ability to turn them off</a> - that needs to stop - explicit preferences should be honored.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When identity is decoupled from the presentation layer we could have IDMs that align with our needs - we could fine-tune how and when we want to be notified. The incentive for an IDM is not to suck all of our attention (as opposed to applications that usually serve ads) - there are other ways to monetize. We'd be able to set a threshold or filter on anything. Subscriptions can be granular &amp; multidimensional for any type of event stream - like <code>&quot;show me everything from X unless from application A or message type T&quot;</code>. Some IDMs could even offer the feature to show notifications only in specific time ranges of the day - for those addicted to dopamine hits.</p>
<p>TODO: follow anything</p>
<p>What if you wanted to see when someone follows something as an event/notification - each time they follow someone? There's no way to configure the current platforms for that</p>
<p>We should be able to follow playlists in social media - and be able to turn on notifications for them</p>

<p>Writing text forces us to think, but graph construction &amp; exploration would make our thinking more precise and our understanding deeper. Mind Maps are superior when it comes to comprehension and retention of information because they organize it spatially &amp; hierarchically - engaging our brains visually. The source should always be a graph because our that's how our minds represent knowledge &amp; ideas - even though we communicate serially.</p>
<p>Let's take the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Dod9AWz8Rp4Svdpof/why-i-think-there-s-a-one-in-six-chance-of-an-imminent"><code>&quot;Why I think there's a one-in-six chance of an imminent global nuclear war (October 2022)&quot;</code></a> post by Max Tegmark for example and <u><strong>ignore if we agree with him or not</strong></u>.</p>

<p>His thesis is effectively a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>, which he goes on to explain in greater detail with text. But his tool to make that graph was probably for simple diagrams - incomparable in terms of capabilities to what we're envisioning here. Graph-first thinking just isn't how we express &amp; communicate (yet).</p>
<p>But why would we do that? What are the benefits?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>render</strong> our thoughts into different mediums: text, audio &amp; video through the use of LLMs &amp; generative AI - expanding the accessibility of our work beyond those that can view thought-graphs. A graph has many ways to be traversed so we can ask the AI to generate multiple versions. We could also specify a node path (which nodes/subgraphs and in what order) for the serialization into text and also paragraphs to be inserted at specific points (perhaps you want to write the introduction or conclusion yourself). We could also have fine-grained control such as annotating specific nodes to be skipped from the serialization or to signal their importance so that the AI adds more or less emphasis. We could have movie-maker-like software with a timeline where we orchestrate the traversal. This wasn't possible until the recent advancements of LLMs &amp; AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being able to say &quot;<strong>view source</strong>&quot; of a text article and being shown the thought-graph that the author used to generate it. The serialized output could also have an automatically generated mapping so that we can see which regions correspond to which nodes &amp; links with some highlighting and we could have both displayed side by side for synchronized &quot;playback&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about <strong>editing</strong>? Refactoring &amp; &quot;rewriting&quot; will be just a matter of moving &amp; reconnecting nodes &amp; subgraphs, followed by a re-render of the outputs by the AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could generate <strong>change reports</strong> &amp; summaries for a thought-graph throughout time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>debug / fact-check</strong> the logic in the circuits of thought-graphs. Choose ontologies &amp; fact databases and evaluate the connections of a graph for logical consistency against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>pattern-match</strong> our thought-graphs with others and we could compute the similarity of (sub)graphs and track the provenance &amp; plagiarism of ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability</strong> - the better you annotate your thought-graph with well-known &amp; widely used semantic web concepts &amp; ontologies - the easier it will be to discover your content. People don't put #hashtags without a good reason (even though they are extremely limited).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">NYT</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ft.com/">FT</a> have their own proprietary knowledge graphs but they publish only plain text. <strong>Analysis</strong> of journalism is at the level of word use frequency throughout time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's clearly visible in <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRozado">@DavidRozado</a>'s word frequency graphs. They change a lot faster than usage. Injustice, for example, was not invented in 2013.&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1272593601932013568">Paul Graham</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;According to a new study by David Rozado, there has been a big increase in news headlines suggesting fear, anger, disgust, and sadness since 2000, and especially since about 2010. Journalists are pushing your buttons.&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1583058588687212544">Paul Graham</a></p>

<p>&quot;We should discuss this graph more. (peer review)&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/EricRWeinstein/status/1483860161965932544">Eric Weinstein</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Journalism goes hand in hand with frame control (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotive_conjugation">Russel conjugation</a> - <strong>what is</strong> vs <strong>how to feel about what is</strong>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect">Gell-Mann Amnesia</a>, cherry picking and many other problems. Imagine the introspection possible if everything was expressed as thought-graphs and was interlinked. What if we could fork &amp; edit thought-graphs to remove bias? Can we become post-narrative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no thought-graph exists for an article - anyone could construct it and tag it to the original resource - making it discoverable for anyone to use. <!-- TODO:LINK TO THE OTHER SECTION --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But could such a change happen? A good example are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter">Jupyter</a> notebooks whose documents are interactive with parts of them being executable code, along with the option to plot/visualize/reuse the results of that code. We will continue reinventing how we interface with technology and information - static plain text is not the be-all end-all.</p>

<p>We should be able to see all references &amp; content related to any identity, event/document or entity/concept/noun as a collection of comments, reactions/votes, annotations, redirections and edits/forks which we could organize &amp; filter through the UI. Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some YouTube videos have comments disabled. Why? Could be many reasons: <strong>1)</strong> perhaps they don't want to have their content associated with low quality comments, <strong>2)</strong> maybe they don't like the <a href="https://prnt.sc/ORguwjXfLgLR">scammers &amp; bots</a> and want to protect their audience, <strong>3)</strong> maybe they haven't fully thought this through, <strong>4)</strong> or maybe they are actively trying to hide something. But anything public can be discussed on other platforms (Reddit?) - all you've done is made it harder to find that discussion but it's still there (and is most likely fractured across different platforms/subreddits). The valid reasons (<strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>) can be negated with better tooling for content moderation - both for active participants (tagging, annotating, voting) &amp; the passive ones (simply consuming &amp; filtering through the UI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if we could provide alternative titles for content and crowdsource the ones which most accurately describe it - countering the clickbait? Users could choose to view the original titles or the crowdsourced versions if there's consensus for a specific title to be way better than the original. This is already happening in StackOverflow - titles of other people's posts can be edited by moderators (or anyone?) with the goal of improving accuracy. What constitutes &quot;better&quot; and which/how votes are counted can be configurable too. But wouldn't content creators object?! Sure, but what are they going to do? But data can be composed in any way imaginable in the Giant Global Graph. This is like taking the best comment about what a post/video should be titled and through something like a browser extension programatically using that instead of the original in the UI - you can't stop that. We could even calculate clickbait scores for content creators - I bet many would have more than 90% of their content re-titled according to some criteria. We could even feed such scores into recommendation algorithms - <strong>disincentivizing clickbait</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The perpetual AMA (Ask Me Anything) - currently only a small handful of people have done <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA">AMAs in Reddit</a> that last only up to a few days with an extremely limiting interface in a sporadic/random fashion. What if every account had an implicit AMA associated with them (something like <a href="https://ask.fm">ask.fm</a> but a lot more powerful) and we could ask any leader/CEO/celebrity &amp; hyper agent questions with special message types and link them to their accounts? We could collectively surface the most pressing ones and make it glaringly obvious if the important ones aren't answered or if the answer is of poor quality - through different dashboards/charts &amp; sorting/filtering. We could hold them to higher standards &amp; more scrutiny. What if we could pressure companies &amp; CEOs about the use of Cobalt from African mines with slave labor? Doing a poll on <a href="https://change.org">change.org</a> is extremely ineffectual, but if something like it was integrated with a new more expressive type of social media for virality - it could have drastically different results. It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same interconnected identity &amp; data network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions that relate to a piece of content. Let's take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPOcBVzm7s"><code>&quot;Jillian Michaels: Don't believe the keto diet hype | Big Think&quot;</code></a> video for example. How do we determine if what's in there true? All we have is a comment section and a sidebar with algorithmic recommendations. Turns out there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jillian+michaels+keto+reaction">a number of reactions</a> but they're not shown next to the video in any way - how would we know about their existence if we didn't explicitly search for them? The goal is not to be exposed to multiple points of view &amp; reach some conclusion - it's only engagement. The videos are not interlinked, but suppose they were - we could have a list of reactions displayed along with scores of disagreement and other factors and we could more easily discern which one to watch next. <!-- The way to expose the complete failure & corruption of the FDA & their misguided policies is through a bottom-up crowdsourced effort enabled by the Internet and further enabled by linked data, identities & reputation. --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the YouTube playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC9lvrBhVt4UUkhzpp3N5_x"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory | Computer Science | Khan Academy&quot;</code></a> for example. The videos are out of order, but someone has made another playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq2EDMGUqkHHjHLhp88RY-e5mN7uGMP75"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory (in order)&quot;</code></a> that is fixed. This is essentially a fork - one that is better than the original. Why can't we see a crowdsourced redirection suggestion attached to the original?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A unified identity layer, the ability to deduplicate content, to annotate semantically &amp; the move to structured data greatly helps with being able to pull everything related to something. However, one concern is negative reputation &amp; &quot;scarlet letters&quot; - the ability to taint an entity and have the bad reputation follow it without the ability to hide it. But we can develop tools, norms &amp; criteria to evaluate/rank/filter any document &amp; reaction that relates to something. Moreover, even if there isn't a direct data connection between 2 entities (one referring to the other), as long as they are both public someone could index them and make that link. This problem already exists today.</p>

what if we could choose that the recommender AIs do not show us faces with artificial filters (annotated as such by others) - wouldn't that disincentivize the use of such filters?
Obviously this isn't thought through completely - it could turn out bad if the annotation isn't reliable - its just trying to illustrate a point.
we could use AI to detect this instead of human annotation &amp; reactions

<p>In Medium you can tweet a selection (sentence/word/paragraph) but when going back to the article from the tweet you don't get shown the original selection. With some archival services you can point to a text selection - for example <a href="https://archive.ph/O2D45#selection-635.4-635.18">this link has <code>&quot;Prussian Model&quot;</code></a> selected from the title when you open the page (<code>#selection-635.4-635.18</code>) and you can change the selection which also changes the URL, but that's possible only because there's a specific hash in the URL (<code>O2D45</code>) and the document is guaranteed not to change in the archive - however that's not the case with Medium where the authenticity of documents is host-certified and they can change in time.</p>
<p>With Headjack URIs point to a specific version of a document and as explained in the <a href="names_and_paths.html#addressing-within-content">addressing chapter</a> we could point to parts of documents in the URIs. If a document has been changed, updates will have their own new URIs and when an application is showing an old URI with intra-document addressing it could:</p>
<ul>
<li>either show a label that there's a newer version of the document and the user can switch</li>
<li>or directly show the new version if it's possible to transfer the selection without conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Headjack's intra-document addressing is universal - it works for audio &amp; video too and the application from the <a href="startup_case_study.html">startup case study</a> could display this clip with this quote in a much better way:</p>

<p>&quot;The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything&quot; - <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxphJhihcVY-U-PLFEvDl1m7Rb-iq4CGgo">@naval</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be pushed further - any composition/remix/meme of media could contain the references to the original text/pictures/audio/video so the sources of something can be traced and credited - imagine something like a movie maker that composes from other clips and all metadata is retained.</p>

<p>current social media has a choice architecture in the UI that's misaligned with users - they're solely optimizing for engagement &amp; time spent - the goals of people</p>
<p>we take the agency we have in search engines for granted (we explicitly type what we're looking for), but we've completely abdicated agency in the feeds that feed us information in social media - we ought to have a choice there as well
In search we are looking for something and want control. But aren't we looking for something in our feeds as well? Why not have more agency - even if it leads to less time spent on the app?</p>

<p>the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled &amp; recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization

<p>YouTube recently removed the option to sort the videos of a channel by oldest first - because why not - because they can.</p>
<p>the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized &amp; undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.</p>

<p>Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages &amp; trade secrets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;According to Netcraft in May 2015, the industry standard for monitoring active TLS certificates, &quot;Although the global [TLS] ecosystem is competitive, it is dominated by a handful of major CAs — three certificate authorities (Symantec, Comodo, GoDaddy) account for three-quarters of all issued [TLS] certificates on public-facing web servers.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The internet is decentralized as much as its weakest links which are DNS &amp; certificate authorities</p>
<p>By July 2022 just 3 certificate authorities (IdenTrust, DigiCert &amp; Sectigo) are responsible for <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/ssl_certificate">3 quarters of the entire market</a>.</p>
<p>Certificate authorities should be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Furthermore, content served by a website through HTTPS (so using SSL) cannot be cached &amp; cryptographically frozen in time because if the certificate is revoked then there's no way to actually prove the order of events - when was the data signed (cannot rely on internal timestamps) and until when was the certificate valid. Headjack fixes this by anchoring all off-chain events with a merkle proof on-chain &amp; sequences what's relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In a separate disclosure unrelated to Snowden, the French Trésor public, which runs a certificate authority, was found to have issued fake certificates impersonating Google in order to facilitate spying on French government employees via man-in-the-middle attacks.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)">wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet more CENTRALIZATION in checking for the validity of certificates:
reliance on OCSP which is vulnerable to DDoS, replay attacks 
turtles all the way down - CAs delegate other entities to be OCSP responders
Also if a MITM attack is possible then 
If an attacker has compromised the private key of a server and is doing a MITM attack then OCSP requests will also be going through them - rendering OCSP an unreliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because most clients will silently ignore OCSP if the query times out, OCSP is not a reliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol#Criticisms">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Freedom can be a competitive advantage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> lets you leave &amp; take your subscribers with you (an email list) - a conscious choice to compete on the quality of service. <strong>But they are an outlier</strong>.</p>
<p>Headjack's fundamental premise is that it unlocks many possibilities &amp; value to users because the barrier to entry for services would be much lower and they could be composable &amp; interoperable which would lead to greater innovation, quality, choice &amp; freedom. So given that users would benefit more in this ecosystem and that their attention is finite &amp; will be spent either way - it stands to reason that there is money to be made in an even bigger pie! But competition will look different.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The rule book will be different - instead of <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-marketscompetition">vertically integrated</a> services with tons of employees that reinvent the wheel, companies would specialize and compete on different layers of the stack. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">Markets Are Eating The World</a> - there will be one for each of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage &amp; retrieval of historical events, data &amp; results of batch processes.</li>
<li>Indexing at scale and even custom indexing by specific criteria.</li>
<li>Training of AI models for recommendation systems, feeds, etc.</li>
<li>Ad serving engines that match users with ones that would be relevant to them.</li>
<li>Computed views (aggregate metrics) such as counts of likes &amp; other interactions.</li>
<li>Content moderation &amp; safety labelers (malware/copyright/offensive/spam) producing lists with flagged accounts, specific pieces of content or even entire applications.
<ul>
<li>Their output could be used not just for the final presentation layer but also before indexes, models &amp; computed views are created as they could be gamed with spam.</li>

<p>Creating a new social application would require just a bit of frontend code by a few developers with all the heavy lifting of infrastructure, data storage &amp; processing, content moderation, ad serving &amp; recommendation engines being provided by pay-as-you-go services through APIs. The (<a href="https://mattturck.com/the-power-of-data-network-effects/">data</a>) network effects will be shared by every actor in the ecosystem. Launching a proof of concept would be trivial and new business models &amp; use cases (no ads for social) would be enabled.</p>

<p>It will take some time for markets to mature and the dust to settle once specialization &amp; competition are democratized, but then prices will be low and the efficiency &amp; quality of services high.</p>
<p>what if apps have to explicitly pay to infra for their data to be stored?</p>
<p>services will no longer have the host-centric model to point to as the reason for siloing data - just the fact that we would give an address to our documents that is beyond any specific host is enough of a reason for the nature of competition to change</p>

<p>The goal is democratized access, competition &amp; innovation  - not the end of the Ad model which is a pipe dream - it isn't going anywhere. The current problem is that we don't have alternatives and that there's no transparency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Attribution is the accounting layer of the entire user-acquisition stack: social media, organic community building, referral programs or (gasp!) even ads, they’re all just inputs to attribution. It's much more than just bean-counting, though the bean-counting is important. It’s the capital ‘T’ Truth that the entire ecosystem depends on.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/why-spindle">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Internet monetization is somewhat like a Soviet election: It doesn’t matter who clicks and where, it’s who counts those clicks that matters. The technology and business of that counting of clicks (and everything else you do online besides) goes by the dull-sounding name of attribution, and it determines the fate of trillion-dollar companies.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's examine the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A recent example of questionable attribution: I tweeted about my e-mountain bike, Jason Calacanis (of all people) saw it and asked about the model. Someone posted a review from bikeradar.com, and Jason (I don’t know if this is true) probably googled for it and maybe bought it. Who deserves the attributions credit? According to Google (surprise, surprise), it’ll be Google … and they’ll take all the credit, which is why Google is worth so much and Twitter so little.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entire flow could be tracked </p>
<p>Furthermore, attribution services could credit accounts that retweet content and add more interactions with it with some of the profits</p>
<p>de-duplication through content addressing &amp; adding traceability of content helps paint the picture what happened when and by who - aiding attribution. Infrastructure companies on which applications get deployed on can handle such tracking within them but since all the data is openly broadcasted competing services could offer alternative business models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whether it be circulation numbers for 19th-century newspapers (the start of the printed ads business), or Nielsen ratings for pre-cable TV that determined ads rates there, there’s never been a media ecosystem that didn’t have attribution.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you had to conjure some collective mechanism for storing aggregated data that was selectively shareable between publisher and advertiser, it would look much like a blockchain.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>^^ this can be done through verifiable computation &amp; sharing indexes between publishers &amp; advertisers within index infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">This article</a> posits that attribution has to go on-chain but Headjack offers an alternative - through the infrastructure companies.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that mass media &amp; aggregation will be handled by centralized services that can save user details in logs - what we could do is make a market for user data and make it easier to opt out of such data harvesting with alternatives &amp; a way for whistleblowers to prove if a contract hasn't been honoured.</p>
<p>composable media - pick a recommender algo, search, UI</p>
<p>the history of actions and tracked events would be private and shared only between infra platforms and ppl paying for ads?</p>
<p>Identity wants to emerge
Over the long run, any stable joinable key becomes an identity as it accumulates more correlated information about you.
We see this today in the ads ecosystem, where data brokers and cross-site advertising networks use data joining to correlate information about you and track you around the internet. Email addresses, cookies, IP addresses, advertising identifiers—anything that is unique and stable can be used for data joining.

<p>One reason Headjack would win is because there will be no wallet fragmentation - users will mostly have 1 account.</p>
<!--
Headjack only facilitates addressing but doesn't store anything besides the history of keys and authorizations - all content is off-chain and for example GDPR compliance will affect all services but not Headjack itself (Not sure if this is true). An excellent read on the topic: [The right to never be forgotten](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-right-to-never-be-forgotten).

must read about this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_integrity
-->
<p>Ads themselves are not the root evil - it's the lack of choice &amp; ability to exit in the current monopolistic world due to the benefits of vertical integration in the current host-centric paradigm</p>
<p>Any service that makes more money naturally attracts more eyes and if its some kind of monopoly there's an incentive to crowdsource a competitor if changes are wanted</p>
<p>headjack is not so much about open source (there's plenty of room for commercial players with proprietary software) - it's more about open design - the framework that all services would follow and interplay with each other</p>
<p>it's not a high level of redundancy that is needed - it's a low enough barrier for entry for any component in the media pipeline to be filled by anyone should the need arise - opening up the competition</p>
<p>there's no need for competitors - there's a need for an ecology of business within a stable framework of cooperation and competition, and if any one of them goes away a related one could fill that niche</p>
<p>do a diagram with the flow of information through a few filters &amp; layered indexes - show who is paying who and what is public and what is private and how this can support both ads &amp; subscription models to varying degrees</p>
<p>what if the whitepaper comes with an IDM specification or design such that it would be modular and the individual pieces could be described from the start so that people can jump in and work in parallel towards the same shared vision? This is the data and opinion portability network.</p>
<p>pitch the VCs: this is not constructing a single thing and trying to own it as much as possible - this is a model for collaborative media building and since it's modular and there are plenty of slices for everyone we can simply fund the best teams and not have to compete for the sections that we aren't profficient in. There's no need to fear competition because its in the best interest of everyone to simply do the next chunk that could provide a composable service</p>

<p>All content is published through applications and the creator's choice for which one to use is forever embedded in the content URIs.

<p>IDMs could also provide a <a href="algorithms_feeds_aggregation.html#feeds--home-pages">feed</a> &amp; a home page similar to current social networks with the most &quot;relevant&quot; content for users and even serve ads, but there'll be a lot more configuration options &amp; choice because all IDMs will be in competition with each other &amp; users will be able to migrate.</p>

<p>Currently, companies cannot target you directly with ads without the social media platforms as middlemen - but with open data, any company could analyze the world and decide what their target audience is.
Currently, Coca-Cola targets audiences with the same ad but with some precision - imagine if they could directly target individuals with tailor-made ads based on them - what if an algorithm picks up that you're gay and coca cola send you an ad with a shirtless male (if you're male) - point taken from Yuval Noah Harari here: https://youtu.be/j0uw7Xc0fLk?t=260</p>
<p>Imagine influencers being able to use algorithms to generate synthetic versions of themselves pitching different products to different people and having the application infrastructure serve different versions to different people based on who they are. The influencer is the magnet and the algorithms are the tailors. This is the future whether we like it or not. The good thing about an unbundled media stack is that some services will let you avoid ads for a subscription fee.</p>

<p>Why not just show a histogram of where most of the comments are and provide a resizable window as an additional widget on the timeline (in addition to the progress cursor) which can filter comments &amp; annotations based on the range and display the threads below Reddit-style with sorting &amp; filtration options? Here's a screenshot of precisely that (ignore the colors &amp; bad style):</p>
<img src="images/startup_case_study.png">
<p>The ultimate audio/video player can offer a lot more than just a comment histogram - it has the potential to be a vibrant social experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-click repositioning &amp; resizing of the filter window to timestamp ranges for different topics plotted as horizontal bars (already done &amp; visible in the screenshot)</li>
<li>sharing links to specific ranges - as clips, but without losing the context
<ul>
<li>many channels re-upload clips from longer videos - this should instead be a simple &quot;retweet&quot; of the original material with a range (window) as a parameter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>different types of comments: annotations, questions, personal (private) notes</li>
<li>search field for within the comments that are in the current filter window</li>
<li>crowdsourced annotations (tagging resources/events/concepts/entities)</li>
<li>plotting/toggling different types of histograms (not just comment density):
<ul>
<li>plotting different types of reactions</li>
<li>where other users spend most of their time</li>
<li>where the user has already played the episode</li>
<li>comments that have more than X upvotes or up/down ratio</li>
<li>where the most controversy or facts requiring a crowdsourced check are</li>
<li>highlighting comments that match the current search filter/query/regex</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJvFr9v7Nk">older video</a> showcasing this UI (can't resize the window with the mouse yet).</p>
<h1 id="a-unique-interface"><a class="header" href="#a-unique-interface">A unique interface</a></h1>
<p>This is nothing like SoundCloud where <a href="https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/for-fun-prod-by-beatsbyjeff">tiny overlapping rectangles</a> with profile pictures are rendered on the timeline that you can just hover with the cursor to see the comment nor like YouTube where you can write a timestamp (<code>hh:mm:ss</code>) in a comment which becomes a clickable link that fast-forwards the player - fighting it out with the other 20 000 comments in the single linear vertically scrollable section of a 3 hour long podcast and hoping to be noticed - both are horribly insufficient and unusable. For both of them comments are just an afterthought - it is extremely hard to discuss specific parts of long-form media &amp; for good localized signal to actually surface &amp; be noticed.</p>
<h1 id="challenges-in-the-current-web2-world"><a class="header" href="#challenges-in-the-current-web2-world">Challenges in the current web2 world</a></h1>
<p>How would this work as a web2 company?</p>
<ul>
<li>For it to provide value it would need many users commenting on the same video or otherwise there will be no histogram and the whole interface will be pointless. It needs a network effect.</li>
<li>Discoverability is hard - it would require that users actively share links to it on other platforms.</li>
<li>What if YouTube/Spotify cut it off &amp; disallows embedding their players &amp; using the APIs?</li>
<li>Unclear if it should try to be its own platform or just a (browser) plugin to other platforms:
<ul>
<li>The platform way is more ambitious but requires a ton more work &amp; <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertical integration</a>: direct messages, a social graph, notifications, a feed &amp; recommendation systems, etc. Would it need to compete with YouTube &amp; Spotify at some point? The likely <a href="images/startup_failure_outcome.jpg">outcome</a>.</li>
<li>The plugin way is a much more limited experience. How would users share links to comments &amp; timeline ranges to others that don't have the plugin installed? How will users be notified for comments &amp; replies? You'd be completely beholden to the platforms.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation"><a class="header" href="#how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation">How Headjack's paradigm fosters innovation</a></h1>
<p>Contrast that to a web built around Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of work for this UI would be minimal - reusing components already present:
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a>, DMs, notifications, progress bars, preferences &amp; connections will all be handled by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>.</li>
<li>The heavy lifting (processing &amp; indexing all broadcasted events, perhaps moderation &amp; even ad serving) will be handled by infrastructure services which will charge the application just the right amount for the sets of API calls &amp; indexes that it needs - pay-as-you-go. There will be different competing infrastructure providers and applications will be able to migrate to the one with the best service or it may even utilize multiple ones at the same time - offering users the choice which indexes &amp; filters to use.</li>
<li>The costs &amp; team required to implement this UI will be minimal and focus would be on delivering value to users. The barrier to entry would be lower and better UX &amp; functionality would be unlocked - many more niche needs could be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application discoverability - the moment someone with a following posts a comment through it that comment would immediately be visible to their audience on applications like Twitter and the URI for the comment will contain the name of the application that was used for its generation - serving as application attribution &amp; advertisement of the alternative application. No need for influencers to explicitly share <code>&quot;hey! check out this platform where I made a comment and make sure to follow me there&quot;</code> to their audience - it'll be automatic &amp; implicit.</li>
<li>No risk of platforms cutting access to their APIs to third-party apps &amp; changing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service">ToS</a> because in this ecosystem everything is a third-party app around unified identity and data is no longer host-certified - addressing is <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">data-centric</a>.

<p>Twitter's potential has fascinated some of the brightest people in the world ever since its inception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's a new messaging protocol, where you don't specify the recipients. New protocols are rare. Or more precisely, new protocols that take off are. There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP (the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on. So any new protocol is a big deal. But Twitter is a protocol owned by a private company. That's even rarer.&quot; - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/twitter.html">Paul Graham</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the original sin has been that it's <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1518772754782187520">owned by a company</a> which Jack Dorsey states as <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1562861302242226178">his biggest regret</a> - no wonder that he's been trying to turn it into a protocol - first with <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">project Bluesky</a> (now <a href="https://atproto.com/">AT Protocol</a>) and more recently with <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1535314738078486533">TBD Web5</a> (both covered in the <a href="competition.html">comparison chapter</a>).</p>

<!-- The global digital / unified / singular firehose -->
<p>One way to look at Headjack is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network where accounts, message types, tags, application sources &amp; <a href="data_legos.html#event-streams">anything within documents</a> can be treated as topics to subscribe to - a multidimensional notification highway. It's the ultimate user-friendly successor of the <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008">too technical</a> RSS - <a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html"><code>&quot;people jumped ship as soon as something better came along&quot;</code></a>.</p>
<p>When compared to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a>: it provides only logical addressing (allowing for the storage layer to evolve &amp; migrate data seamlessly) and delegates the data availability (storage &amp; retrievability) of the actual documents/events to the entities in the ecosystem (users/IDMs/applications/archives) on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees (but with <a href="store_and_retrieve.html#how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri">multiple ways for retrieving data for a URI</a>).</p>
<p>Twitter's firehose allowed you to ingest all events on the platform in real time for a <a href="https://qr.ae/pvly2N">steep price</a> and was eventually <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benkepes/2015/04/11/how-to-kill-your-ecosystem-twitter-pulls-an-evil-move-with-its-firehose/?sh=4cd97d0f61d3">shut down</a>.

<p>Headjack's address space can be thought of as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a> and is enough for practically infinite number of events with the concatenation of 4 integers (64bit/32bit/64bit/32bit - see <a href="addressing.html">addressing</a>) + the ability for <a href="knowledge_management.html#intra-document-addressing">intra-document (fractal) addressing</a> - much better for indexing than hashes.

<p>Everything in software deals with abstractions but very few are done right:</p>
<!-- The problem with abstraction layers is combinatorial explosion. -->
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Abstractions leak all the time; there is an explicit cost in terms of hooking things up, and implicit costs in terms of edge cases, dependency management/upgrade/maintenance costs and decision fatigue. Individually, each abstraction might bring enough value to overcome its costs. However the combinatorics of M x N x O x P abstractions in each layer is an externality weighing down the entire ecosystem.&quot; - <a href="https://www.swyx.io/narrow-waists">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A narrow waist protocol is a constraint that unconstrains everything on top of it when communicating with everything on the bottom - allowing for the 2 layers to evolve independently of one another. It should be radically simple, minimalistic, stable &amp; unopinionated about what goes on below or on top of it. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> is perhaps the best example:</p>

<hr />
<p>Today social media applications have to reimplement the same functionality &amp; <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-marketscompetition">vertically integrate</a> which is <code>O(M × N)</code>. With Headjack there'll be a market for every layer of the stack &amp; solutions can be reused - <code>O(M + N)</code>. The core enabler for this is the linking of data to <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441">sovereign identity</a> which leads to portability &amp; interoperability between applications &amp; the end of the host-centric model.

An ecosystem on a shared identity layer with uniform content addressing will outperform closed ecosystems not only because of the permissionless innovation not possible before, but also because of the reduced effort and code reuse - every problem needs to be solved only once.</p>

also about data leaks:

<p>One major problem of the current <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html#todays-web-host-centric">host-centric</a> internet architecture is that documents are host-certified - we refer to data by location instead of contents, but that leads to link rot &amp; content drift. Information is fragile without an ecosystem of identity, reputation, references, context &amp; liability - our digital history lacks a solid foundation. We can't expect everyone to be like <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">@balajis</a> - linking to articles from the Internet Archive (<a href="https://balajis.com/synthesis/">Example</a>: look what <code>&quot;Prussian&quot;</code> in that text is <a href="https://archive.ph/O2D45">pointing to</a>) - this doesn't scale, data is still not self-authenticating and is reliant on a central point of failure. The internet is a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2019-06/2019-06_zittrainIP.pdf">collective hallucination</a> and is rotting. It's as permanent as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_mandala">sand mandala</a> and its just a matter of time for it to go away. Some great quotes:</p>

<p>The same document may be published through different platforms and because of the host-certified web of today it will get multiple different URLs. Discussion around it becomes fragmented &amp; shallow in the different platforms with separate comment sections and there isn't a way to de-duplicate &amp; unify it. This facilitates polarization as separate echo chambers can form without seeing the opinion of other types of people.</p>

<h1 id="moderation--censorship"><a class="header" href="#moderation--censorship">Moderation &amp; censorship</a></h1>
<p>This is an incredibly hairy topic with many aspects - here are just a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>No clear rules for moderation &amp; censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
<ul>
<li>account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like <a href="https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/">shadow banning</a></li>
<li>accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no way for users to &quot;fork&quot; a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.</li>
<li>There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter &amp; YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertically integrated</a> teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner. In an open system such as e-mail the competition &amp; innovation for solving spam has been tremendous.</li>

Misinformation is a plague in videos without context

the health of reporting on the web through video is appaling - decentralization and democratization are powerful but without the means to interleave everything into a shared ledger of record and actually have some accountability it all becomes an informational mess. But YouTube doesn't optimize for that - not at all.

<p>Most applications will have some kind of moderation &amp; filtration but at any point in time anyone will be able to create a competitor with a different set of rules and/or functionality. Migration can be seamless and the activity of accounts could (and in most cases will) be displayed in both at the same time - but the preferred application will be signaled through the URIs of public actions.</p>
<p>Content coming from competitors could be completely banned but that would be shortsighted - data coming from somewhere else should be displayed as long as it is properly structured and actions from banned accounts can simply be shown as deleted in reply threads.

Imagine publicly stating what you want to filter out of your life and then others observing which apps you choose. This is a way to signal personal preferences you'd like with everyone - we are mimetic creatures -->
<p>But this can be pushed a lot further - using public <a href="messages.html">message types</a> more specific preferences within one application (and compatible with others) could be signaled. The choice of recommendation algorithms, filtration criteria &amp; moderation levels could be displayed in account profiles throughout all applications either as badges or in some other way.

We could boycott it. And why not choose indexes &amp; algorithms that up &amp; down regulate specific accounts? Moderation could be done through a set of filters to which users opt in/out by toggling &amp; layering - choosing what to amplify and what to tone down. Such preferences can also be private.</p>

Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol

The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity & interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus

A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case

No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum & is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains

I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.

finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability & retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block & the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...

Ethereum uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called Secp256k1.
the address is the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key.

This ensures that most apps do not end up hosting ECDSA key pairs which create security and regulatory challenges if funds are sent to them on Ethereum.

concern: a complete mess of message types with overlapping functionality

The limiting factor: data processing & computation

data problem: separate sets of indexes from different infrastructure companies? in case someone is spammy and infra company X doesn't want to work with them? We can still have some sort of federated queries.

not being able to hide the like counter - bad for mental health?

mistakes such as doing some action publicly when intended for a private action...

algorithmic interference - even if you've chosen a good algorithm, it may be using signals from others who are using worse algorithms and thus the worse algorithms are influencing the better one

Suppose an event is just a simple reaction - probably less than 100 bytes including everything necessary. With 32 byte hashes we would end up with 0.64kb just for the proof of inclusion in the blob with 1 million elements which is at least 6.4 times larger than the data itself.
<ul>
<li>This isn't a problem for infrastructure companies that store the entire data blobs or the applications that publish them as there's enormous overlap in the proofs for the elements witin a blob (so the proof overhead will be less that the entire blob itself and it can even be entirely skipped as the proofs can be re-generated), but entities like IDMs that want to cache individual elements for their users out of the aggregate blobs will have to store a lot more data.</li>
<li>A possible way to reduce the size of proofs is to use much wider trees (not binary but with a branching factor of up to 1024, or maybe even more!) with KZG vector commitments - they allow us to prove that an element is part of a set with a small constant size proof - without having to provide the hashes of all sister elements. Ethereum will be moving to a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html">Verkle tree</a> structure for the same reasons - reducing the depth of the tree and the size of proofs for individual elements. 1 million elements can be represented with a tree with a branching factor of 1000 and depth 2 and only 2 KZG proofs would be required to prove the inclusion of any element. However, it's not clear what the performance costs would be when uzing KZG commitments (or their size) - <u><strong>this should be researched.</strong></u></li>

<ul>
<li>Edits/updates or deleting a document will result in a different URI - the original URI/document are unaffected. This means that all infra &amp; apps will have to monitor the network for updates of elements but some might miss it because an update may come from anywhere - not necessarily from the original application that posted the event.
<ul>
<li>One option is whenever an edit/update/delete is made, the application that's used to generate it would have to explicitly notify the IDM of the user (and maybe also the original application) that there's been an update. The IDM may keep a compact map of document URIs that have had changes and point to the URI of the latest version of those documents (but no intermediate versions) without any proofs. All updates should always refer to the URI of the original version of an event. However, there are 3 problems with this: <strong>1)</strong> if the IDM doesn't check the authenticity of the edits/updates it may be fooled into thinking that the user has changed something, <strong>2)</strong> an application might not inform the IDM, <strong>3)</strong> this will lead to additional storage requirements for IDMs, and <strong>4)</strong> this will lead to a lot of traffic &amp; requests from all kinds of applications to IDMs just to check if there's been an update for a document before visualizing it. <u><strong>A better solution is needed.</strong></u></li>

<li>State growth - Headjack keeps a lot of the history in its materialized state in order to guarantee historic data availability so that anyone can generate proofs for older events - not just the &quot;current view&quot; (which also constantly grows because of more and more accounts). However, most of this is compact integers (block ranges for ownership &amp; authorizations, nonce mappings, etc.) and growth will not be very high - should be well below that of Solana even with billions of accounts.

However, this is the best tradeoff that would allow for true mass adoption and is still a massive improvement to the status quo. A big failure scenario is if an IDM that manages millions of accounts goes rogue or shuts down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those that have not bound a keypair to their accounts will effectively be stuck.</li>
<li>The chain could get congested by those who have keypairs and suddenly all at once start submitting on-chain transactions directly to move to another IDM but that problem can be alleviated through <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/an-off-chain-bls-aggregation-scheme-which-might-reduce-the-casper-finalization-to-1-min/5427">signature aggregation</a> if the signed payload is the same like for example if a big chunk of them move from IDM <code>666</code> to IDM <code>42</code> specifically.
<ul>
<li>If they haven't exported their off-chain data managed by their previous IDM it could be lost - social graph, DMs, preferences, etc.</li>
<li>However, these problems (loss from a &quot;trusted&quot; service going down and network congestion on rare events) will be shared by any solution that has &quot;trusted&quot; services that are required to reach any meaningful scale. Some users could run their own version of an IDM for their private data but they'll have to pay for more bytes on-chain which is not something that everyone could be doing at once.</li>

<p>Updates &amp; deletes to content may not be applied/displayed properly in all applications - there will always be those that don't honor edits or <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/architecture.md#purge-requests-hard-removal">purge requests</a>. However, this is a problem with almost any decentralized protocol and most established applications will be honoring these types of messages or else people will simply move to different ones. In the end, this will not be an issue on any meaningful scale as social forces will solve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data pointed to by a URI is not by itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">self-authenticating</a> - it needs accompanying cryptographic Merkle proofs that only full blockchain nodes can generate. However, no solution provides fully self-authenticating content as keypairs might have changed - there will always be a need to consult with a <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a> entity. Also archiving &amp; bookmarking services (or fully self-contained articles/books with no external dependencies) that don't want to rely on repetitive requests to the blockchain in the future may request these proofs initially and store them along with the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what happens if an event that's not anchored yet becomes illegitimate by an IDM unauthorizing an application before the content is anchored? Confusing for people...</p>

<p>what if a specific application is very spammy and infrasturcture blacklists it, but some users use it and expect their creations &amp; edits to be visible elsewhere?</p>

IDMs could be responsible for producing "streams" of the user activity - by simply referencing all activity from other applications (applications either need to notify the IDMs or IDMs need to monitor everything - for private data they probably need to be explicitly notified?)

Today, advertisers blast and drip communications to users in hope of capturing attention at the right time. Tomorrow, advertisers can place a price on the cost of a message and pass along an embedded financial incentive for users to read it. We can imagine dynamic inboxes in the future where value can be attached to messages, and mail/messaging apps can automatically push value-laden messages to the top of the inbox. Inboxes themselves can monetize out of these rules, and give users flexibility to select filters or configurations that work while allowing advertisers to target high-value users.

    - possible solution: batch them off-chain into 1000 batches, construct BLS aggregate sigs, sign a msg & transmit that along with a bitmap for which keys participated in the batching to a block.
    Users will need to coordinate off-chain & decide from which block to revoke the access, which other ACM should be approved, etc. This can be used in other scenarios too.

when having multiple names, an account should specify their preferred one - possibly as a message type


ens is not enough - one size fits all aint good


Off-chain namespaces for handles? Dot something to be off-chain?

names should have an index and that index can be reused in different "TLDs" - alex.eth & alex.com - alex can be identified by the same number so that TXs are small


Names can have an index and subdomains can refer to the names by idx - vbuterin should be in the state once even if rhere is a vbuterin.com and a vbuterin.eth - names are created once and reused by idx
