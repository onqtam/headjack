<p>Headjack is an <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640">open state database</a> designed for <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">web-scale</a> media (in the billions of users) that addresses the most fundamental pieces of the puzzle: identity, connections, names and <a href="introduction/addressing.html">content addressing</a> with human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a> paths (instead of hashes) all packaged in a credibly neutral &amp; self-sustaining blockchain. It is <a href="motivation/ambition.html">aiming</a> to disaggregate the giants and end network effect monopolies &amp; data silos by aligning incentives and acting as the backend network that users won't even need to know about by striking the right set of tradeoffs. It is engineered from first principles - building up from the data to support billions of users and a <a href="https://twitter.com/arvanaghi/status/1537519858233008128">customer obsession</a> for the best UX - there will be no mass adoption without retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to.</p>

TODO:

In Headjack identity is simply a number.

Identity means different things depending on the context but at the end of the day at the root of it there is an identifier - any type of use case specialization can be built around that - KYC is orthogonal to having identity & being able to associate content to it for online publishing at web-scale - there are no limits to the amount of content that can be created & addressed - both in terms of quantity and size.

Headjack focuses on the essence - everything else can be built around it.

It also specifies protocols & standards for connections, DMs, message types, etc. - basically all the building blocks necessary for a fully fledged ecosystem. Any existing web2 service can be recreated on top of it, but the doors are open for the next step of innovation (possibilities).

"the ability to link content to users without limits"

TODO: link to the pillars

What you don't want is for these identifiers to be fractured between many platforms with different standards & formats. The simplest unified singleton model wins.

a blueprint for the future web


The core value proposition is the ability to link infinite amounts of data to identity and sequence that throughout time.

<p>Headjack is an information network. It solves identity &amp; universal sign-on. It is an addressability layer that is agnostic to the means of delivery. It is an index and a historian - the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="on-chain-vs-off-chain"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-vs-off-chain">On-chain vs off-chain</a></h1>
<p>Due to practical limitations, it is <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">impossible</a> to put everything on a blockchain so we have to make a key distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity &amp; connections being the most valuable - a clear example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> (basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)">Medium</a> but you own the mailing list for your audience). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking &amp; ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681">essential crown jewel</a> that needs preservation - the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">pub-sub</a>. The data availability (DA - storage &amp; retrievability) for identity &amp; the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.</li>
<li>Content should be stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> and other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time. Most of it doesn't have to be stored forever but any piece can be backed up through third-party archival services. It gets anchored with cryptographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle roots</a> in the main chain so that permissions, inclusion &amp; sequence are provable - that way even if content goes dark it can later resurface and be deduplicated by linking it to previous instances (as long as Merkle proofs are present).</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/messages.html">message</a>/event/action/data/content are used interchangeably in this book and refer to any type of event/content a user might have generated - post/comment/reaction/etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When identities become portable, backends become liquid&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/coconidodev/status/1504850437727571974">@balajis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game theory behind why competing interfaces (presentation layers/applications/views - probably operated by a company with a business model) would freely share the activity of their users with others to display is that if they don't they would be effectively denying reach - users would migrate to a competitor because the cost to do so is 0 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty_Model"><code>voice and exit</code></a>. Current social media platforms are monopolies because identities are not portable and the network effects are in private database silos - a problem practically insurmountable for incumbents.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#guiding-principles">Guiding principles</a></h1>
<p>There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption &amp; parity on convenience &amp; UX with Web2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aggregation and scale cannot be an afterthought - must be scalable to billions of users and that must be <a href="introduction/../introduction/numbers.html">obvious &amp; provable</a> if entrepreneurs are expected to jump on the opportunity. The easiest mental model will win over developers - opinionated frameworks with a concrete direction are much simpler than a sea of standards, libraries &amp; chains.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Developers care about risk.&quot; - <a href="https://haseebq.com/why-decentralization-isnt-as-important-as-you-think/">Haseeb</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; pass / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize interfaces to post on their behalf. RSS was <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008">too technical</a> and it failed - <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss"><code>&quot;people jumped ship as soon as something better came along&quot;</code></a>.</p>

<li>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data &amp; blockchain interactions by default - costs &amp; complexity should be shifted to services.</li>
<li>Users should be able to own their identity &amp; connections in a sovereign way with a keypair <strong>even if by default</strong> their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.</li>
<li>Anyone should be able to have a pseudonymous identity, operate an <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a>, or serve media through an interface.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="identity--authorization"><a class="header" href="#identity--authorization">Identity &amp; authorization</a></h1>
<p>There are 3 types of roles in Headjack (although a single entity may play all 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, follow relationships, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing interfaces to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke the authorization). They will also be responsible for handling DMs as discussed <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html#dms">here</a>.</li>
<li>Interfaces - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All follow relationships &amp; authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space. Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering &amp; exclusion of content based on its type/tag or interface that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.</p>
<img src="introduction/../images/sequenced_integer_relations.png">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to interfaces using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the interface with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/connections/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to interfaces and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an interface by saying <code>&quot;discard activity generated through interface Y from block X forward&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - it is still an enormous improvement compared to the current Web2 status quo.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Interfaces will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their activity will need explicit signatures - updating follow connections on-chain will be more costly because they'll take a lot more bytes but the requirement of signatures will not impact the cost of the off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
</ul>
<img src="introduction/../images/authorizations.png">
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; Merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="introduction/../images/meme_integers_and_relations.jpg">
<p>In practice, we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly connections &amp; authorizations) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be lightweight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. Their subscriptions/interests matter most, but at any point in time, they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath interfaces.</p>

<p>Key &amp; session management (rotation, authorization &amp; revocation) <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/key-revocation-in-self-certifying-protocols/">require</a> ordering that is <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a>. This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (<code>&quot;X follows Y&quot;</code> only affects <code>X</code>) and that is <a href="introduction/../introduction/numbers.html">provable with easy to grasp napkin math</a>. It is compatible with any type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> - anything could be associated with an integer ID. The on-chain authorization has incredible synergy with the human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="introduction/addressing.html">addressing</a> for off-chain content.</p>
<p>In Headjack all connections in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> are asymmetric and also visible &amp; on-chain as it is geared towards <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks">public discourse</a> but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - handled &amp; stored by <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) and focusing on that aspect first greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect - propagation &amp; reach are sought after. Identities will have their own customized landing pages off-chain through an IDM.</p>

<p>The move from host-centric to data-centric addressing is a complete paradigm shift by itself but Headjack intertwines that with names and on-chain authorization &amp; sequencing of anchors resulting in the best possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> in terms of human-readability &amp; persistence - perhaps the most important aspect of the project.

<p>Today's web revolves around hosts &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast">unicast</a> communication - we query <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> to get the IP of servers and open direct connections with them to retrieve the data that they host. But domains, URI paths on servers &amp; the actual files all change &amp; go away which leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> &amp; content drift. Guidance such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">&quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;</a> is just that - guidance - and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> is just a bandaid that can hardly keep up with the digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a>. In the host-certified paradigm URLs at best point to a location at which a document may have been available at a point in time - devoid of any cryptographic proofs regarding the contents, the creator, or the time of publication (as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">self-authenticating</a> data) and everything lives in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">silos</a> with no interoperability which severely limits the possible innovation and composability on the web and leads to fragmentation of the public discussion (if any).

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-centric_computing">Data-centric computing</a> is an emerging concept that has relevance in information architecture and data center design - data is stored independently of the applications, which can be upgraded without costly and complicated data migration. This is a radical shift in information systems that will be needed to address organizational needs for storing, retrieving, moving, and processing exponentially growing data sets. It increases agility by prioritizing data transfer and data computation. Applications become short-lived, constantly added, updated, or removed as algorithms come and go.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-addressable storage</a> (CAS) is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content (not its location/name) and is a key piece of the puzzle. Identifiers are based on content and any change to a data element will necessarily change its content address. The most famous example of CAS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> but it suffers from non-human-friendly addresses (hashes) and performance issues &amp; extreme latency (tens of minutes) if the content is not widely cached/pinned because of the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">Self-authenticating data</a> moves authority from hosts to users. The three components that enable it are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic identifiers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">CAS</a>, and an emerging area of research called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> which is yet to be applied in any meaningful scale.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking">Information-centric networking</a> (ICN) is an approach to evolving the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information (or content or data). Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand, and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. In information-centric networking, the cache is a network-level solution, and it has rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, and smaller cache sizes.</p>

However, there are many unsolved challenges with it like the need to reimplement foundational routing infrastructure to make it stateful and hierarchically structured names which require a root name authority to link them to keypairs - outside of its scope. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM">a great lecture</a> on the topic.</p>
<h1 id="enter-headjack---the-ledger-of-record"><a class="header" href="#enter-headjack---the-ledger-of-record">Enter Headjack - the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a></a></h1>
<p>Headjack is a weird amalgamation inspired by everything above - it provides human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> for self-authenticating data (with <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proofs</a> &amp; the blockchain) along with the means for its retrieval without forcing a specific way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> is just one option). It acts as the web-scale global index used to check the authenticity of documents (requires consulting with the chain), ownership of names, key management &amp; sequence of events throughout time. It is an addressability layer on top of the current host-centric internet technologies.</p>
<p>It is an informational gravity well with a strong network effect that would suck all data to be cryptographically anchored to it, coupled with identity, names, authorization management, connections &amp; sequencing - giving birth to the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a> where argument from cryptography begins superseding argument from authority - truth anyone can computationally verify.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blob-structure--addressing"><a class="header" href="#blob-structure--addressing">Blob structure &amp; addressing</a></h1>
<p>Interfaces accumulate off-chain activity from users which they cryptographically anchor in batches with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> and they determine how often to do so (it doesn't have to be on every block) - those with little activity may submit only once per minute or even less often - the frequency is determined by platforms based on the volume of activity and the on-chain costs for publishing bytes. When enough activity has been collected it is packed in a blob and all the events generated since the last anchored batch are sorted &amp; grouped by users in some deterministic way &amp; schema (users based on index/name and user interactions based on the type/sequence).</p>
<img src="introduction/../images/blob_structure.png">
<p>When a batch is finalized an interface does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It generates the blob header which contains the intra-blob index (offset table) for lookup of content of specific accounts.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> that touches every event is deterministically constructed following a schema.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) for the blob is generated and the IPFS blob is pinned &amp; downloadable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only 2 things that are signed &amp; submitted on-chain are thus the Merkle root and the IPFS CID for the next nonce (auto-increment counter) associated with the interface account.</p>
<h1 id="optimal-content-delivery"><a class="header" href="#optimal-content-delivery">Optimal content delivery</a></h1>
<p>The blobs may be in a hierarchy such that the on-chain IPFS hash points only to the &quot;root&quot; blob that contains the header and the actual indexed data could be in child IPFS blobs (whose <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> is contained in the root blob or header) so entities listening for events by specific accounts on Headjack may download only these headers and determine which &quot;leaf&quot; blobs they need to fetch for the data they are interested in (if any). Note that even private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">intranet</a> data may be anchored but not retrievable by the public if the blob IPFS CID is never published or pinned/hosted - unified addressing for public &amp; private.</p>
<img src="introduction/../images/root_child_blob_separation.png">
<p>Interfaces maintain the logical order of events for the future batch in maps in order to provide intra-blob addressing even before it is fully constructed - as an example if a user posts an article and immediately after that comments on their post - the comment should be able to refer to the post which is not yet committed on-chain. Interfaces will also display activity by others that is not yet anchored and the interactions can still use the proper addressing when referring to the yet-to-be-anchored messages (the next nonce number is known in advance). Any type of interaction is addressable and sequenced in the blobs - including reactions (likes, etc).</p>
<p>Interfaces are yet another on-chain account and they'll be able to associate a REST/RPC endpoint or any other means for direct contact by the rest of the interfaces so that they may ask for the yet unanchored messages and display them while they are still in the &quot;mempool&quot;. They can also advertise the multiaddress of their IPFS nodes so that each successive blob of generated content that gets published can be downloaded by others instantly by manually connecting with IPFS’s <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/speeding-up-ipfs-pinning-through-swarm-connections-b509b1471986">“swarm connect” functionality</a> - avoiding the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> for each new blob CID which may take tens of minutes. They can provide addresses to multiple IPFS nodes as a cluster for horizontal scaling and use <a href="https://ipfscluster.io/">Pinset orchestration</a> - designed for Automated data availability and redundancy.</p>
<p>Interfaces may choose not to use IPFS at all - what they must do is anchor their blobs with a Merkle root and provide some on-chain advertised means to retrieve the data (example: REST/RPC endpoints in their account). We expect that IPFS will be the lowest common denominator and will always be used no matter what other solutions are also available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="persistent--provable-uris"><a class="header" href="#persistent--provable-uris">Persistent &amp; provable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a></a></h1>
<p>Each account has an associated auto-increment counter (nonce) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content. So if an interface has submitted 2 times already, then the next submission will be with <code>nonce == 3</code>. The blockchain keeps a mapping in its state for each previous nonce value to the block number when it changed so that <code>&lt;interface_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> can be translated to which block has the Merkle root anchor &amp; <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> for the blob that corresponds to that nonce for that account. The 2 can be extracted from the historic block.</p>
<!-- (the 2 could also be cached directly in the state) -->
<img src="introduction/../images/blob_URI.png">
<p>Once a blob is fetched through the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) we can address specific events by utilizing the offset index in the blob header so a URI such as <code>&lt;interface_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_id&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> can point to a specific post, comment or even reaction (activity is grouped by users). The content ID for a specific user is usually a small single-digit number and is necessary only if there has been more than 1 interaction by that user through that interface for the given nonce (maybe rare).</p>
<p>The blockchain can be queried if the interface was allowed to post content on behalf of the user through on-chain authorization (probably initiated by an <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDM</a>) when that specific block was published in order to determine if the activity is authentic - the state keeps information for each account such as since what block number a given interface was authorized to post on behalf of a user (and until when - all ranges). Users may avoid using IDMs and explicitly sign their actions in which case their data will be accompanied by signatures within the data blobs and the only check required will be for the user keypair used for the specific block number. To recap - to prove the authenticity of any event:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the data is actually part of an anchored blob with a <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proof</a> to a block.</li>
<li>Then check if the user actually submitted the event:
<ul>
<li>Either if at that point the interface was authorized to post on behalf of the user which would require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (authorization ranges).</li>
<li>Or by checking for an explicit signature &amp; the public key of that account at that time which would also require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (account key history).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Most of the cryptography checks will be happening instantly as blobs are published &amp; ingested by interface infrastructure &amp; stored in more optimal database formats for content to be later directly served. Users will always be able to request an on-chain proof for any event and the Merkle proofs will probably be regenerated on the fly to avoid storing them. 
Note that there can be many different &amp; valid Merkle proofs for the same URI from different blockchain states at different block heights.</p>
<p>This is what makes URIs persistent - as long as someone hosts the content it will always be identifiable with the original URI from when it was posted using Merkle proofs &amp; the blockchain (either a specific URI + a Merkle proof or the entire blob should be stored). The <a href="introduction/names_and_paths.html">following chapter</a> shows how names in the URI paths are persistent too (even if user/interface names change ownership at some point).</p>
<p>Users should be able to check the URI of content even if created through a different interface and ideally the origin should be displayed by default - acting as attribution for other platforms.</p>
<p>Edits &amp; updates to content come as <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/messages.html">messages</a> with new unique URIs that reference the older message URIs and it is up to interfaces to properly display the context that there have been changes and perhaps the ability to view the old or automatically redirect to the latest. &quot;Forks&quot; are possible but they represent interface failure to detect that an old version is being edited.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-retrieve-blobs--specific-content"><a class="header" href="#how-to-retrieve-blobs--specific-content">How to retrieve blobs &amp; specific content</a></h1>
<p>There are multiple ways to retrieve blobs &amp; content for specific URIs from the past:</p>

<li>The original <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> might still be retrievable from the original interface account that posted it or any other that has pinned the data.</li>
<li>The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages.</li>
<li>Other well-known players without a direct on-chain connection to the interface/user in a URI could be asked if they have the content:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure companies that do the heavy lifting for interfaces and store everything.</li>
<li>The analog of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> in this ecosystem also stores everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interface accounts can point on-chain to a traditional host which should be used to display content published through them. As you'll see in the next chapter interface names can also resemble traditional domain names so it will be possible to copy-paste such URIs directly into your browser as long as they own the same domain in the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> and they should be able to serve a webpage displaying the specific piece of content.</p>

# On proof permanence

One thing to consider is if a user revokes the authorization of an interface to post on their behalf retroactively - not just going forward but also invalidating all anchored content & follow/unfollow events for the last couple of days through that interface. This would mean that cached Merkle proofs for such invalidated content will no longer be valid and the latest state of the blockchain will refuse to produce new such proofs, but the cached proofs could mislead someone. Retroactive revocation can happen only up to `X` days to limit the scope of changes to cached proofs & what infrastructure would need to handle but still give enough time for anyone to react in case an interface has posted fraudulent activity on their behalf - a **mostly theoretical concern**. Proofs for blocks older than `X` days are therefore considered permanent.

<p>Headjack is also a name registry - accounts can own a handle and be identified with it. There have been other attempts to decentralize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecoin">Namecoin</a> and <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a> but a much stronger network effect is necessary in order to succeed. Headjack is a confluence of multiple interrelated things (identity, names, authorization, connections &amp; addressing) and has the potential to truly decentralize DNS. For specifics around the details (constraints, subdomains, auctions, distribution, hoarding, leasing, etc.) please refer to <a href="introduction/../implementation/handles.html">their dedicated page</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Users and interfaces don't need a name and can operate as an integer index just fine, but the preferred case will be with handles. Names can change ownership but the blockchain will be able to translate <code>&lt;interface_name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> with strings into the canonical integer form discussed <a href="introduction/uris.html">previously</a> by substituting the interface &amp; user names with account IDs.</p>
<p>Every name has an associated auto-increment nonce (just like account IDs) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content and the blockchain records maps of <code>&lt;name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> which can then be used to resolve the URI as discussed in the <a href="introduction/uris.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>
<img src="introduction/../images/account_name_state.png">
<p>But we need to be able to translate not just the interface name but also the user name which may have changed ownership at any point - for that the blockchain keeps track of the account ID ownership of every name historically as ranges (from block X to block Y name N was owned by account A) so when we determine the block number for a given data blob we'd be able to check to which account IDs do names in URIs correspond to at that time. Alternatively the user name &lt;=&gt; account ID mapping at the time of the blob could be embedded within the blob header (along with proofs) so that fewer queries are necessary to the blockchain.</p>
<p>And thus we're able to have URIs such as <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> to identify any event by any actor - all we'd need to do is a few lookups and we'll be able to use Merkle proofs for any piece of content to prove authenticity. Most URIs could even omit the 4th part because probably there won't be more than 1 action by a user for a given batch by an interface.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri">What to ask the blockchain about a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap: we can ask the following questions about this URI: <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>To which interface account ID &amp; nonce does <code>twitter.com/55212</code> correspond?</li>
<li>In which block does the interfaceID/nonce map correspond?</li>
<li>What is the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> &amp; Merkle root of the anchored blob?</li>
<li>What account ID does <code>johnny</code> correspond to in the block where this blob was anchored?</li>
<li>Once we download the blob or just the blob header (using the IPFS CID or any other means):
<ol>
<li>We can ask the offset table where within the blob is <code>johnny</code>'s content № <code>3</code>?</li>
<li>Once we fetch the actual data &amp; depending on whether it is explicitly signed or not:
<ol>
<li>either if the interface was authorized to post on behalf of <code>johnny</code> at that time,</li>
<li>or if the signature matches the keypair that's been bound to <code>johnny</code>'s account at the time of the anchored block.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The blockchain can generate Merkle proofs from the blockchain state for any of these questions.</p>

<h1 id="content-titles-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#content-titles-in-uris">Content titles in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Most Web3 platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1537388439259291649">suffer from unreadable URIs</a> but we've done a lot better - note the brevity and lack of hashes &amp; hexadecimal symbols (<code>0xf56a0...</code>) - in fact, this is as good as it gets...</p>
<p><strong>Or is it?!</strong> What about headlines of articles - can we have them included as well - something like <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3/how-I-went-from-vegan-to-keto-and-back-again</code>? Absolutely! The string is not at all necessary to resolve the piece of content (just like in StackOverflow where the database key for a question is just a number (example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4">question 4</a>) but the page router always changes the URL when loading the page to include the title too). <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/messages.html">Message types</a> for posts with titles will have a dedicated field which will get included in the content hash and thus spoofing the title will be rejected by conforming interfaces as it would be a trivial check.</p>
<h1 id="addressing-within-content"><a class="header" href="#addressing-within-content">Addressing within content</a></h1>
<p>Different schemas could be used for addressing within pieces of content (like a paragraph from an article or a clip from audio/video - without losing the context of the whole) and message types could have by default associated on-chain schemas (or the schema of choice could be embedded within the header of the message). For example, when <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/121/66</code> is being loaded the associated schema will be looked up depending on the type of message (in this case - an article) and used to interpret the last part (<code>121/66</code>) which could mean a character selection with an offset from the start and length. The embedded schema could be overridden by explicitly stating which one to use within the URI. As an example, <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/schema/42/121/187</code> could mean <code>&quot;use on-chain schema number 42&quot;</code> which could interpret the last part (<code>121/187</code>) as start offset and end offset instead of start &amp; length - resulting in the same selection as before. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1544001073844731904">individual pages &amp; paragraphs of books</a> should be referencable in such a manner and could be composed of multiple separate posts - and this is just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>For big types of content (audio/video) the message could be broken down into chunks so that users can load only the message header and then depending on the schema used and the addressing within the content - only the necessary chunks could be requested.</p>

All of this infrastructure is not just about handling enormous amounts of data but also about great UX &amp; responsiveness: <code>&quot;Latency is not an option anymore&quot;</code> - Amazon <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">found</a> that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales.

<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="introduction/competition.html">most of the competing attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. We need to be realistic and focus on the essence - Headjack decentralizes only the most important part of monopolies - the identity &amp; interest graphs and thus leveling the playing field for competition. It accomplishes this by compact graph representation and avoiding the need for keypairs &amp; signatures by default through an on-chain authorization mechanism while maintaining the optionality for anyone to be fully self-sovereign &amp; explicit - acting as a base layer for competing &amp; interoperable services. It also facilitates data-centric addressing of content under a global namespace which further disincentivizes hoarding data in silos. But Web2 isn't going anywhere - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><code>&quot;market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization&quot;</code></a> dictate that the best services will be running on huge server racks in data centers with sophisticated caches &amp; batch processing infrastructure behind familiar UX. The difference will be that users will be able to cryptographically prove content and will be able to leave any of these interfaces for better ones if their offering degrades.</p>
<p>Anyone would still be able to run software locally, browse the ecosystem, and fetch content &amp; interactions from entities they've subscribed to (although quite bandwidth-intensive), but their experience will be extremely limited in that they won't be able to run any sort of query/filtration/feed algorithm at scale nor aggregate the activity of billions of people in real-time.</p>

<li>
<p>No credible path to <a href="introduction/../introduction/web_scale.html">web-scale</a> - some will hit a wall even at 1 million users. Most are vague around their scalability &amp; data structures and don't put it <a href="introduction/../introduction/numbers.html">front and center</a> - obfuscating the most important bit. Instead of focusing on NFTs &amp; developer APIs, start with the data and work up from that. Fake it till you make it is not a viable strategy with the wrong foundation.</p>

<p>Overall good intuition about the concept of <a href="https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks">sufficient decentralization</a> (putting only what is absolutely necessary on a blockchain) but the p2p node implementation takes on too much <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#7-security-considerations">responsibility, complexity &amp; assumptions</a> (consensus, CRDTs, trees, ordering, flooding &amp; replay attacks, etc.) and is lacking in other areas.</p>

<p>One of the few solutions with their <a href="https://www.frequency.xyz/">own chain</a> in the space that makes sense. Their work (the <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">DSNP whitepaper</a>) has had the most influence over Headjack's design but the two have diverged in some key respects - the biggest of which are scalability and content addressability. This idea is too important to leave to a single player without competition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/project-liberty-launched-with-100-million-from-frank-mccourt">100m$ of funding</a> (so far) from just 1 person - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPZnOulBCE">Frank McCourt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good research, good direction, but slow execution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
- Some good ideas in their [DSNP whitepaper](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf) but not nearly enough emphasis on compactness. Too much on-chain & using smart contracts for identities - cannot truly scale. -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keypairs required even for delegated entities (although that can be reworked)
https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identity#delegation
if delegation also happens through keys then they would also have to go into the blockchain state - making it much bigger. In Headjack an authorized interface is simply a few on-chain integers kept in the state (block ranges &amp; account IDs) - no need to keep block ranges for delegated keys.
https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/shorts-one-public-key-is-not-enough/215/3
1 key per device? bloat. inefficient.
&quot;Thus, we can only trust one thing: The actor signing this data had access to the private key.&quot;
all data is expected to be signed with a key - suboptimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>broadcast announcements refer to the content with a URL &amp; HTTP - <a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/Reply.html#url">host-centric</a>, not in the blob, worse hosting guarantees</p>
<ul>
<li>also profile related stuff - https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/Profile.html#url</li>
<li>not really - IPFS possible too:
https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/04-batching-source-dependent-messages-with-delegation/216#where-to-get-the-batch-file-5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>big reliance on hashes for announcement addressing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
- They haven't managed to form a real community yet (although it is still early) and haven't moved as fast as others in the crypto industry for the past 2 years since their inception. -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>No names within the project - just integer IDs for accounts. Content addressing URIs are based on hashes and there's no connection to the batch / service that published it which makes indexing harder - <a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identifiers.html#dsnp-content-uri">example</a>. So addressing content is much worse compared to Headjack's <a href="introduction/../introduction/addressing.html">human-readable &amp; persistent URIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a difference: DMs as announcements (&amp; public - leaking metadata) vs IDM-based (direct IDM-IDM comms) &amp; not anchored to the chain &amp; not announced to the world at all (TODO: revisit this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no hierarchical delegation - keypairs required, every delegation goes on-chain and requires a signature (bulky) - limited throughput.</p>
</li>

<p>Requires the use of keypairs &amp; wallets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every user has their own Ceramic data stream on top of IPFS - it is yet to be proven that the DHT &amp; p2p layers can scale to hundreds of millions or billions of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The persistence of the social graph is handled by pinning IPFS data on nodes operated by them without any cryptoeconomic incentive for the data availability - it will grow into the tens/hundreds of terabytes for web-scale (Twitter scale: 400M users with 700 connections on average) - especially because they don't have a compact integer-based representation and everything is based on big individually signed actions. The upcoming Ceramic blockchain does not seem to be geared towards storage incentivization and will not be the solution to that.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="shortcomings-of-headjack"><a class="header" href="#shortcomings-of-headjack">Shortcomings of Headjack</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>State growth - Headjack keeps a lot of the history in its materialized state as ranges for historic querying &amp; to generate proofs - not just the &quot;current view&quot; which itself constantly grows. However, most of this is compact integers (block ranges for authorization, nonce mappings, etc.) and growth will not be extremely high. <a href="introduction/others_list.html#bluesky">Bluesky</a> similarly wants to be able to prove the authenticity of old content and has a transparency log but it will be much less compact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private social graphs &amp; DMs are facilitated by <a href="introduction/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a> which resemble <a href="introduction/others_list.html#farcaster">Farcaster</a>'s managed hosts and <a href="introduction/others_list.html#bluesky">Bluesky</a>'s Personal Data Servers - a centralization point with some trust assumptions and potential for data breaches. However, this is the best tradeoff that would allow for true mass adoption and is still a massive improvement to the status quo. A big failure scenario is if an IDM that manages millions of accounts goes rogue or shuts down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those that have not bound a keypair to their accounts will effectively be stuck.</li>
<li>The chain could get congested by those who have keypairs and suddenly all at once start submitting on-chain transactions directly to move to another IDM but that problem can be alleviated through <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/an-off-chain-bls-aggregation-scheme-which-might-reduce-the-casper-finalization-to-1-min/5427">signature aggregation</a> if the signed payload is the same like for example if a big chunk of them move from IDM <code>666</code> to IDM <code>42</code> specifically.
<ul>
<li>If they haven't exported their off-chain data managed by their previous IDM it could be lost - private social graph, DMs, preferences, etc.</li>
<li>However, these problems (loss from a &quot;trusted&quot; service going down and network congestion on rare events) will be shared by any solution that has &quot;trusted&quot; services that are required to reach any meaningful scale. Some users could run their own version of an IDM for their private data but they'll have to pay for more bytes on-chain which is not something that everyone could be doing at once.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates &amp; deletes to content may not be applied/displayed properly in all interfaces - there will always be those that don't honor edits or <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/architecture.md#purge-requests-hard-removal">purge requests</a>. However, this is a problem with almost any decentralized protocol and most established interfaces will be honoring these types of messages or else people will simply move to different ones. In the end, this will not be an issue on any meaningful scale as social forces will solve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data pointed to by a URI is not by itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">self-authenticating</a> - it needs accompanying cryptographic Merkle proofs that only full blockchain nodes can generate. However, no solution provides fully self-authenticating content as keypairs might have changed - there will always be a need to consult with a <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a> entity. Also archiving &amp; bookmarking services (or fully self-contained articles/books with no external dependencies) that don't want to rely on repetitive requests to the blockchain in the future may request these proofs initially and store them along with the data.</p>

<p>Engelbart’s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time.”
https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart</p>
<p>true uncensorability. The next philosopher to push humanity forward will be anonymous and global. Imagine not checking out what others are checking out more and more - what are the trends. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE what others are finding most interesting. Most people are rational - let's see what gets the most attention from everyone.</p>
<p>Global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)">common knowledge</a> is important.</p>
<p>human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point - everything important is in our culture &amp; competition happens between ideas. We are building our digital history on shifting sands - there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true. There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible &amp; indexable. A global append-only log for data doesn't have the same requirements as a financial system which needs 100% uptime. The only thing that needs incentivization is data availability &amp; the ability for anyone to offer. There can be different modes of posting - maybe just a hash for content that could be on ipfs and whose contents might have different levels of storage guarantees.</p>
<p>We need everything that needs to bubble up to the top to do so.
sequencing &amp; discoverability is valuable. The ability for any piece of information to bubble up TO THE ABSOLUTE TOP is.. VALUABLE</p>
<p>information theory and physics are interlinked. In the physical world signals traverse based on the natural laws but memetic ideas spread thanks to human-manipulated means - we don't have fair means of dissipation of information. We can't make sense of the world together. We can't coordinate</p>
<p>The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come - steve jobs</p>
<p>Finance and media are the bedrock of society.</p>
<p>the only way to pay for open data is to make a currency that whoever owns it benefits from being on it. Make the voice of people unsilence-able - something pops up - immediately a few people copy it so even if the original goes down - the idea can be re-referenced by others anonymously - until it picks up steam and gets nocited by more</p>
<p>the trust machine may bootstrap the truth machine - where it is incentivized to pop up to the top and the only thing that makes things grow is actually being more interesting &amp; important. HEATMAP of links!</p>
<p>Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.</p>
<p>the same piece of data may pop up multiple times throughout time through different sources - unkillable evidence - one which may live offline for a period and resurface. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOBAL HASH INDEX OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EVER TAGGED?</p>
<p>I want to tag/link/index/sequence all data. I want the truth to bubble up.</p>
<p>imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness. This is the unification</p>
<p>Linked data is essential for discoverability &amp; ingestion of information - this gitbook is an example of that - contrast to what it would be if it was a linear whitepaper. The whole web can be interlinked like this.</p>
<p>Imagine what Balaji could do if he had everything easily referencable through a logseq-like interface</p>
<h2 id="decentralization"><a class="header" href="#decentralization">Decentralization</a></h2>
<p>Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed.

<p>Today's web is broken on many fronts. This page provides a non-exhaustive list of some of the most obvious problems, most of which can be improved or completely solved in Headjack's paradigm, but even this is just scratching the surface - the unlocked possibilities &amp; improvements are explored further in the other pages of this motivational chapter.</p>
<h2 id="the-host-centric-web"><a class="header" href="#the-host-centric-web">The host-centric web</a></h2>
<p>One major problem of the current internet networking architecture is that data is host-certified and everything is centered around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>. The consequences of that are explained in the <a href="motivation/../introduction/host_centric.html">host-centric</a> addressing chapter - go take a look.</p>
<h2 id="black-boxes--algorithmic-bias"><a class="header" href="#black-boxes--algorithmic-bias">Black boxes &amp; algorithmic bias</a></h2>
<p>The interest graph &amp; recommendation algorithms are the architecture of virality - the dynamics of amplification &amp; interaction dictate how ideas surface, propagate, compound &amp; evolve. The people writing the algorithmic feeds are the most powerful in the world - <a href="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3616">@naval</a>.</p>
<p>Ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions &amp; results leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies">Dr. Robert Epstein</a> would <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4q0cNkAHQQMBTu4NmeNW7E">attest</a> - there is 0 accountability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.&quot; - <a href="https://perma.cc/8GDJ-K6AX">the original Google search engine whitepaper</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does such a search engine exist today? Competition &amp; a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.</p>
<p>Another problem is the discounting of explicit user preferences such as subscriptions &amp; the interest graph (following/connections) in our feeds in favor of algorithm recommendations - platforms optimize for engagement &amp; attention and not for utility &amp; value to end users. We all respond to outrage &amp; enjoy the occasional viral cat video but we should be able to tune &amp; filter what gets shown to us. Have you ever heard a YouTuber tell you to hit the notification bell in addition to subscribing?</p>

<p>Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages &amp; trade secrets.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of cooperation, interoperability, duplicated effort &amp; stifled innovation</li>
<li>competition for scarce talent which leads to sub-par solutions</li>
<li>company bloat &amp; inefficiencies
<ul>
<li>companies are harder to manage as they are way bigger than what they could be</li>
<li>bigger size demands higher revenue - pricing out many business models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>differences in functionality between platforms =&gt; complexity for users</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that to open protocols &amp; exportable data where anyone can specialize, innovate &amp; provide the best possible service for a specific vertical &amp; sell it to others. The move from <a href="motivation/../introduction/host_centric.html">host-centric</a> to <a href="motivation/../introduction/data_centric.html">data-centric</a> addressing and open blockchains enable <a href="https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/">interoperability</a> and composability.</p>

<p>Social media platforms are growth-at-all-costs stories because the goal is to achieve a network effect first and become a monopoly with a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp">MOAT</a> at which point the user <a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1473859531343949824">value extraction</a> and cannibalization of ecosystems built on top of APIs can ramp up (<a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/twitter-apis-ending">1</a>, <a href="https://nordicapis.com/twitter-10-year-struggle-with-developer-relations/">2</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/meerkat-founder-on-getting-the-kill-call-from-twitter/">3</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/">4</a>, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/gmail-ifttt-shutdown-google">5</a>). At that point innovation is less necessary (+ is harder due to inertia) and even the quality of service may degrade. User data is the most valuable commodity and scale enables the best AI models &amp; efficiency of value extraction in the advertising model which comes with a slew of problems &amp; perverse incentives.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But despite the concentration of SSO services a lot of identity-related activity is fragmented between platforms due to the lack of standards &amp; interoperability: settings/preferences, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1524886818725847040">direct messages</a>, bookmarks, playlists, progress bars, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3">source</a></p>

<p>Google is way more than just a search engine even though the majority of their revenue comes from advertising - they control large percentages of the plumbing of the web - key choke points such as submarine cables, routing, data centers, browsers, DNS, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidVorick"><code>David Vorick</code></a> puts this perfectly into perspective in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486"><code>The Worrying Depth and Scope of Censorship on the Internet</code></a> - some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.&quot;</p>

<p>The same document may be published through different platforms and because of the host-certified web of today it will get multiple different URLs. Discussion around it becomes fragmented &amp; shallow in the different platforms with separate comment sections and there isn't a way to de-duplicate &amp; unify it. This facilitates polarization as separate echo chambers can form without seeing the opinion of other types of people.</p>
<!-- Alienating large parts of the population & pushing them to alternative closed platforms is not a net benefit. -->
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Echo chambers are intellectual oppression - as opposed to idea labs where ideas are treated as experiments.&quot; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivDwzBYsED4">Tim Urban</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead imagine being able to view the entire discussion around a specific event by tracing &amp; aggregating all of the re-publications, references &amp; re-tweets &amp; quotes of it from anywhere and applying any type of filter to that.</p>
<p>That is what interoperable identity, content-addressing &amp; broadcasted data enables - we can connect and de-duplicate everything and allow anyone to build tools around that - constructing a much bigger graph that what Google have created for themselves.</p>

<p>This is an incredibly hairy topic with many aspects - here are just a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>No clear rules for moderation &amp; censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
<ul>
<li>account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like <a href="https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/">shadow banning</a></li>
<li>accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no way for users to &quot;fork&quot; a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.</li>
<li>There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter &amp; YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal <a href="motivation/problems.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertically integrated</a> teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner.

<p>Self-authenticating data provides a scalability advantage by enabling store-and-forward caches.

With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a>, these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data.

We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.

<li>
<p><a href="https://scribe.rip/p/what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-search-27d1df99f80d">Search engines</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building indexes would be greatly simplified as they will be plugged to the global message bus and update only on events (push) - instead of periodic batch crawling of the public web (pull). The history of changes will be much more granular, precise, complete, structured &amp; authenticated.</li>
<li>Message schemas will greatly aid in the indexability and information extraction from dynamic websites.</li>
<li>The move to data-centric addressing and the desegregation of data will lead to a lot less duplicates and more rich &amp; precise context around any event/message.</li>
<li>Currently ephemeral experiences such as search suggestions leave no trace and it's extremely hard to prove bias as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein#Contributions_to_Internet_Studies">Dr. Robert Epstein</a> would attest - competition &amp; a lower barrier to entry are direly needed.</li>
<li>The range of sophistication of search engines would span the full spectrum - from the data center scale to software that you can run locally at home and most will be specialized - <a href="https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique">The Future of Search Is Boutique</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will no longer need to actively poll all websites on earth periodically &amp; check for changes and save snapshots - instead it will just watch &amp; save all incoming events and have a complete history without any redundant data &amp; inefficiencies.</li>
<li>Actual content &amp; presentation HTML can be decoupled and only the essential could be saved. There could be a new message type for interfaces to signal a change in what they serve to browsers for presentation &amp; rendering of content which the Internet Archive could save throughout time as well to provide the historical views. Redundancy of snapshots can be driven to 0.</li>
<li>Content that is no longer accessible through the original interface that published it and is not explicitly archived by the user that posted it would still be accessible by anyone with the same persistent URIs if archival services are queried - even though they won't be directly linked to the interface/user IDs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dsdfg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>platforms to deploy interface apps without thinking about the infrastructure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SaaS infrastructure companies that host plugin apps and deal with the heavy lifting of data processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your startup idea cant afford the infrastructure to process 100mb/s of ephemeral data? Pay a service a small fee for a subset of data you’re interested in for your PoC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Market for intermediate processed results &amp; indexes so that not everyone needs to reinvent the wheel and build the same set of algorithms and infrastructure over and over again - creating a market for the information pipeline by division of labor &amp; specialization. Any intermediate data structure could be checked for validity based on the inputs - albeit slow. Test but verify - opaque processing rules. No more algorithmic black boxes. Batch processing - web-scale services do that all the time and plenty of work is done on results that are minutes or even hours outdated</p>

<p>Imagine the possible visualizations on the graph data of the hivemind</p>
<ul>
<li>imagine a 3d spacial graph of the interconnected knowledge you should learn, and how as you progress you color the edges to the ideas you're studiying on as a progress bar. continue from wherever you want after pausing, explore the datapoints &amp; the interconnectedness. Imagine shipping a 5GB graph in such software for anyone to experience the ideas someone is trying to communicate to them</li>
<li>imagine creating explanatory videos for each edge (connections between things in life) - saying how the 2 things interplay, and why</li>
<li>imagine wearing a VR headset while constructing your stories as graphs constructed with anchored data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you'll have the option to subscribe (not on-chain but through an interface) to quotes &amp; references of content that interest you - seeing what the reception is and how that unfolds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Different systems with their own cryptoeconomics can be implemented on top of this addressing - adding guarantees for services while still under the same global addressing namespace</p>
<p>There will be a marketplace for every vertical - we need to democratize specialization &amp; competition</p>
<p>wikipedia needs to be git-like. everything can be git-like. new action type: grant ability to someone to &quot;edit&quot; &amp; publish a new version of an item</p>
<p>fork wikipedia?</p>
<p>github needs to be reimplemented on top of this - open source code is a public good - can be interwoven with peer review and public discourse. Any piece of data/event.</p>
<ul>
<li>peer review can (and should) be reimplemented on top of infrastructure like this</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine having a single id for a film and have comment sections for each chapter or minute</p>
<p>special message tag type: referencing something as a fact - but that thing needs an UUID so ppl can look it up and see what's being commented about it over there</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="startup-case-study"><a class="header" href="#startup-case-study">Startup case study</a></h1>
<p><strong>Problem statement</strong>: Long-form media is already the present (&amp; future) and audio/video are preferred over text by many. We should be able to comment &amp; annotate it at specific points in time on the timeline.</p>
<p>But not like SoundCloud where <a href="https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/for-fun-prod-by-beatsbyjeff">tiny overlapping rectangles</a> with profile pictures are rendered on the timeline that you can just hover with the cursor to see the comment nor like YouTube where you can write a timestamp (<code>hh:mm:ss</code>) in a comment which becomes a clickable link that fast-forwards the player and then fighting it out with the other 20 000 comments in the single linear vertically scrollable section of a 3 hour long podcast and hoping to be noticed - both are horribly insufficient and unusable. For both of them comments are just an afterthought - it is extremely hard to discuss specific parts of long-form media &amp; for good localized signal to actually surface &amp; be noticed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Instead why not just show a histogram of where most of the comments are and provide a resizable window as an additional widget on the timeline (in addition to the progress cursor) which can filter comments &amp; annotations based on the range and display the threads below Reddit-style with sorting &amp; filtration options? Here's a screenshot of precisely that (ignore the colors &amp; bad style):</p>
<img src="motivation/../images/startup_case_study.png">
<p>The ultimate audio/video player can offer a lot more than just a comment histogram - it has the potential to be a vibrant social experience like any other:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-click repositioning &amp; resizing of the filter window to timestamp ranges for different topics plotted as horizontal bars (already done)</li>
<li>sharing links to specific ranges - as clips, but without losing the context
<ul>
<li>many channels re-upload clips from longer videos - this should instead be a simple &quot;retweet&quot; of the original material with a range as a parameter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>different types of comments: annotations, questions, personal (hidden) notes</li>
<li>search field for within the comments that are in the current filter window</li>
<li>crowdsourced annotations (tagging resources/events/concepts/entities)</li>
<li>plotting/toggling different types of histograms (not just comment density):
<ul>
<li>plotting different types of reactions</li>
<li>where other users spend most of their time</li>
<li>where the user has already played the episode</li>
<li>comments that have more than X upvotes or up/down ratio</li>
<li>where the most controversy or facts requiring a crowdsourced check are</li>
<li>highlighting comments that match the current search filter/query/regex</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJvFr9v7Nk">older video</a> showcasing this UI (can't resize the window with the mouse yet).</p>
<h1 id="challenges-in-the-current-web2-world"><a class="header" href="#challenges-in-the-current-web2-world">Challenges in the current web2 world</a></h1>
<p>How would this work as a web2 company?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For it to provide value it would need many users commenting on the same video or otherwise there will be no histogram and the whole interface will be pointless. It needs a network effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discoverability is hard - it would require that users actively share links to it on other platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if YouTube/Spotify cut it off &amp; disallows embedding their players &amp; using the APIs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unclear if it should try to be its own platform or just a (browser) plugin to other platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform way is more ambitious but requires a ton more work &amp; <a href="motivation/problems.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertical integration</a>: direct messages, a follow graph, notifications, a feed &amp; recommendation systems, etc. Would it need to compete with YouTube &amp; Spotify at some point? The likely <a href="motivation/../images/startup_failure_outcome.jpg">outcome</a>.</li>
<li>The plugin way is a much more limited experience. How would users share links to comments &amp; timeline ranges to others that don't have the plugin installed? How will users be notified for comments &amp; replies? You'd be completely beholden to the platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation"><a class="header" href="#how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation">How Headjack's paradigm fosters innovation</a></h1>
<p>Contrast that to a web built around Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount of work for this UI would be minimal - reusing components already present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a>, DMs, notifications, progress bars, preferences &amp; connections will all be handled by <a href="motivation/../implementation/ecosystem/IDM.html">IDMs</a>.</li>
<li>The heavy lifting (processing &amp; indexing all broadcasted events, perhaps moderation &amp; even ad serving) will be handled by infrastructure services which will charge the interface just the right amount for the sets of API calls &amp; indexes that it needs - pay-as-you-go. There will be different competing infrastructure providers and interfaces will be able to migrate to the one with the best service or it may even utilize multiple ones at the same time - offering users the choice which indexes &amp; filters to use.</li>
<li>The costs &amp; team required to implement this UI will be minimal and - focus is on delivering value to users. This will lower the barrier to entry and unlock better UX &amp; functionality - many more niche needs will be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interface discoverability - the moment someone with a following posts a comment through it that comment would immediately be visible to their audience on interfaces like Twitter and the URI for the comment will contain the name of the interface that was used for its generation - serving as client attribution &amp; advertisement of the alternative interface. No need for influencers to explicitly share <code>&quot;hey! check out this platform where I made a comment and make sure to follow me there&quot;</code> to their audience - it'll be automatic &amp; implicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No risk of platforms cutting access to their APIs to third-party apps &amp; changing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service">ToS</a> because in this ecosystem everything is a third-party app around unified identity and data is no longer host-certified - addressing is <a href="motivation/../introduction/data_centric.html">data-centric</a>. There are no <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp">MOATs</a> &amp; lock-in - everyone focuses on their niche and competes on competency &amp; offering the best possible service.</p>

<p>Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs &amp; micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441">making it sovereign</a> - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.</p>

<p>Think of Headjack as an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf">information bus</a> on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self-describing messages, dynamically definable message types &amp; permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity, connections &amp; authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage &amp; retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>) for which durability &amp; retrievability is on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees. It can <a href="motivation/../introduction/numbers.html">scale</a> practically as much as necessary. Another way to look at it is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network similar to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a> where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway.

Moving to a data-centric model where everything is addressable under a common global namespace would force applications to be <a href="https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/">interoperable</a>.</p>

<p>Headjack <a href="https://boxkitemachine.net/posts/zero-to-one-peter-thiel-definite-vs-indefinite-thinking/">definitively</a> aims to be the backbone of the entire public web - the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a> where all content is cryptographically anchored and totally ordered. The confluence of human-readable &amp;persistent addressing, indexing, identity, names, and the interest graph results in a winner-take-all network effect with unprecedented gravity that can organize the world's data - <a href="https://youtu.be/3qHkcs3kG44?t=3527"><code>@naval: &quot;The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything&quot;</code></a>.

<p>Headjack is the <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">15th and final</a> standard for decentralized identity and media - just because it's a lot of work doesn't mean we shouldn't be building on the right foundation. It is the supermassive digital gravity well and is going after the entire web as the coordination substrate of <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">cyberspace</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

<p>You go to rollups with your capital to transact and exchange - with Headjack you wont be able to take your state back with you to L1 because the entirety of headjack is the state</p>
<p>Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity &amp; interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus</p>
<p>A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case</p>
<p>No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum &amp; is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains</p>
<p>I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.</p>
<p>finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability &amp; retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block &amp; the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...</p>
<p>Finance is about preservation of energy - the double spend problem
And thus scalability there is different from media scalability which is a data problem</p>
<p>Media is about data access and sequence</p>

<p>Twitter: 400M users (220 MAU), average connections: 700
1.1 TB for arrays of arrays with 4 byte integers (the graph)
2.2 TB (x2) if storing connections both ways for faster lookups (who do I follow &amp; who follows me)
4.4 TB (x2) if using long long int (8 bytes) - infinite indexes
Metadata (pubkey, handle, description) per index would be O(1)
Less than the bytes required for 700 connections on average
Realistic state size: ~20TB - database overhead &amp; merkle roots
The entire Twitter graph can be populated in a month with 1 MB/s of blockchain bandwidth</p>

With verifiable computation, these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.
We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.</p>

The most common suggestion we received in regards to our CSAM problem was to connect our website to Facebook and send them every single file that our users upload, so that Facebook can scan the file and tell us whether the file should be allowed on our website. A similar service is offered by Microsoft, and I believe Apple and Google each have something as well.</p>
<p>hope for spam &amp; moderation: if there is a market for it it could be solved faster as compared when a monopoly has to deal with that - like with spam and email - anyone can build tools to fight spam in email</p>
<p>this project doesn't have all the answers for moderation &amp; spam protection but it is the base layer that can support anything on top.</p>

<li>developer mindset vs network bootstrapping mindset &amp; how to attract influencers.</li>

<p>TODO: think about</p>
<ul>
<li>tech talent</li>
<li>growth strategy</li>
<li>do a table with different groups &amp; types of ppl versus use cases (images, video, etc) and see which segment could be targeted</li>
</ul>
<p>having a clear case for metaverse companies seems to be a solid route to gain initial traction, may be better to emerge with an industry versus tackle the existing until critical mass

<p>point of view: creating an interface without the ability to lock-in users is daunting - but what if most aspects of an interface are commercialized &amp; offered as a service so creating a new interface is just the frontend?</p>
