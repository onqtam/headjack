<p>Headjack is an <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640">open state database</a> designed for <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">web-scale</a> social media (in the billions of users) that addresses the most fundamental pieces of the puzzle: identity, connections, names and <a href="addressing/addressing.html">content addressability</a> with stable &amp; readable paths resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URNs</a> (instead of hashes) all packaged in a credibly neutral &amp; self-sustaining blockchain. It is <a href="introduction/ambition.html">aiming</a> to disaggregate the giants and end network effect monopolies &amp; data silos by aligning incentives and striking the right balance of tradeoffs - there will be no mass adoption without retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to.</p>
<p>Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs &amp; micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441">making it sovereign</a> - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="logo.png">
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="on-chain-vs-off-chain"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-vs-off-chain">On-chain vs off-chain</a></h1>
<p>Due to practical limitations it is <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">impossible</a> to put everything on a blockchain so we have to make a key distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity &amp; connections being the most valuable - a clear example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> (basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)">Medium</a> but you own the mailing list for your audience). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking &amp; ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681">essential crown jewel</a> that needs preservation - the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">pub-sub</a>. The data availability (DA - storage &amp; retrievability) for identity &amp; the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.</li>
<li>Content should be stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> and other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time. Most of it doesn't have to be stored forever but any piece can be backed up through third-party archival services. It gets anchored with cryptographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle roots</a> in the main chain so that permissions, inclusion &amp; sequence are provable - that way even if content goes dark it can later resurface and be deduplicated by linking it to its previous instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game theory behind why competing interfaces (presentation layers) would freely share the activity of their users with others is that if they don't they would be effectively denying reach - users would migrate to a competitor because the cost to do so is 0 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty_Model"><code>voice and exit</code></a>. Current social media platforms are monopolies because identities are not portable and the network effects are in private database silos - a problem practically insurmountable for incumbents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When identities become portable, backends become liquid&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/coconidodev/status/1504850437727571974">@balajis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="core-idea"><a class="header" href="#core-idea">Core idea</a></h1>
<p>There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption &amp; parity on convenience &amp; UX with Web2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be scalable to billions of users and that must be <a href="introduction/scaling.html">obvious &amp; provable</a> if devs &amp; entrepreneurs are expected to jump on the opportunity.</li>
<li>Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. RSS was <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008">too technical</a> and it failed - <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss"><code>&quot;people jumped ship as soon as something better came along&quot;</code></a>. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; pass / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize interfaces to post on their behalf. Linking IDs to financial accounts on Ethereum/Solana/etc by default is misguided.</li>
<li>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data by default - costs should be shifted to services.</li>
<li>Users should be able to own their identity &amp; connections in a sovereign way with a keypair <strong>even if by default</strong> their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.</li>
<li>Anyone should be able to have an identity, operate an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> or serve media through an interface.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>There are 3 types of entities in Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>User accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, follow relationships, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing interfaces to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke that authorization).</li>
<li>Interfaces - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All follow relationships &amp; authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space. Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering &amp; exclusion of content based on its type/tag or interface that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.</p>
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/6abnkg.jpg">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to interfaces using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the interface with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/connections/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to interfaces and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an interface by saying <code>&quot;discard activity from block X forward generated through interface Y&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - in the current Web2 world we've accepted that possibility anyway.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Interfaces will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their activity will need explicit signatures - updating follow connections on-chain will be more costly because they'll take a lot more bytes but the requirement of signatures will not impact the cost of off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly connections) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be light-weight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. Their subscriptions/interests matter most, but at any point in time they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath interfaces.</p>
<hr />
<p>Think of it as an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf">information bus</a> on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self describing messages, dynamically definable message types &amp; permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity, connections &amp; authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage &amp; retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>) - durability &amp; retrievability is on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees. Another way to look at it is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network similar to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a> where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway. This is a generalization of Jack's <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">vision for decentralizing Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The internet is the computer but it's missing identity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">acls</a>&quot; - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25734612">someone</a>.</p>

This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (<code>&quot;X follows Y&quot;</code> only affects <code>X</code>) and that is <a href="introduction/scaling.html">provable with easy to grasp napkin math</a>. It is compatible with any type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> - anything could be associated with an integer ID.</p>
<p>TODO: Just publishing vector commitments (Merkle roots) adds a lot more complexity around making the committed data available &amp; retrievable - putting as much as possible on-chain is a simpler model.</p>
<p>A key point is that in Headjack all connections in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> are asymmetric and also visible &amp; on-chain as it is geared towards <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks">public discourse</a> but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - either on-chain (although much more costly &amp; complex) or handled &amp; stored by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect. Identities will have their own customized landing pages - provided either on-chain or off-chain through an IDM - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree">Linktree</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/">valued at 1.3B$</a> and is just a bandaid for today’s fragmentation of identity on the internet.</p>

<p>People grossly underestimate the size of the web and the type of infrastructure that's required - here are some <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">google</a> and <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/">other</a> statistics from a <strong>decade</strong> ago. Here is <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/91513-visualizing-minute-internet-2021.html">another fascinating &amp; mind-boggling</a> yet incomplete picture of what was going on within a single minute of 2021. A peek behind what it takes to run Twitter is a good case in point: <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/10/13/why-are-facebook-digg-and-twitter-so-hard-to-scale.html">1</a>, <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2016/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-efficiency-and-optimization">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale">4</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2021/processing-billions-of-events-in-real-time-at-twitter-">5</a>. All of this infrastructure is not just about handling enormous amounts of data but also about great UX &amp; responsiveness: <code>&quot;Latency is not an option anymore&quot;</code> - Amazon <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">found</a> that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales. Google <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">found</a> an extra 500ms in search page generation time dropped traffic by 20% - 16 years ago - our irritable nature probably hasn't changed.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/68ut9w.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 8px;">
<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="introduction/competition.html">most of the attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. We need to be realistic and focus on the essence - Headjack decentralizes only the most important part of monopolies - the identity &amp; interest graphs, and thus leveling the playing field for competition. It accomplishes this by compact graph representation and avoiding the need for keypairs &amp; signatures by default through an on-chain authorization mechanism while maintaining the optionality for anyone to be fully self-sovereign &amp; explicit - acting as a base layer for competing &amp; interoperable services. It also facilitates data-centric addressing of content under a global namespace which further disincentivizes hoarding data in silos. But Web2 isn't going anywhere - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><code>&quot;market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization&quot;</code></a> dictate that the best services will be running on huge server racks in data centers with sophisticated caches &amp; batch processing infrastructure behind familiar UX. The difference will be that users will be able to cryptographically prove content and will be able to leave any of these interfaces for better ones if their offering degrades.</p>
<p>Anyone would still be able to run software locally, interact with the ecosystem, and fetch content &amp; interactions from entities they've subscribed to (although quite bandwidth-intensive), but their experience will be extremely limited in that they won't be able to run any sort of query/filtration/feed algorithm at scale nor aggregate the activity of billions of people in real time.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole</p>
<p>Engelbart’s dream was to use computers to connect individuals in a network that would allow them to share and update information in “real time.”
https://www.britannica.com/biography/Douglas-Engelbart</p>
<p>on identity: “each time we go from one social network to another we do not need to restate who we are, what our interests are, or who we
know”
Note this article on the dangers of the possible commercial centralization of identity was written before Facebook was even founded.
&quot;as of 2018 the consolidation of power and control over the social web by a few large corporations seems unparalleled&quot;
&quot;Yet given programmers had over ten years to address the centralization of social data, why did these efforts fail? To a large extent, the key failing is that the programmers tried to solve the problem of centralization via the purely technical means of standards rather than taking into account the larger social, economic, and political world into which their code was embedded.&quot;
https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document</p>
<p>&quot;Rather, many, many different individuals and organizations would be able to tweak the system to their own levels of comfort and share them with others—and allow the competition to happen at the implementation layer, rather than at the underlying social network level.&quot;
https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech</p>
<p>TODO: start from the content - list all kinds of content scenarios and what you'd like to be possible. Then think of who would be responsible for aggregating, bundling, indexing &amp; merkelizing the structures &amp; participading in the chain</p>
<p>Ideas should not be sacred - we are just neurons - global &amp; borderless super intelligence</p>
<p>true uncensorability. The next philosopher to push humanity forward will be anonymous and global. Imagine not checking out what others are checking out more and more - what are the trends. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE what others are finding most interesting. Most people are rational - let's see what gets the most attention from everyone.</p>
<p>Echo chambers are intellectual oppression - as opposed to idea labs - treating ideas as experiments - as said by tim urban</p>
<p>solving the cold start problem</p>
<p>the interest graph along with the recommender algorithms orchestrate how ideas surface, propagate, compound &amp; evolve</p>
<p>human evolution is 99.9% memetic at this point - everything important is in our culture &amp; competition happens between ideas. We are building our digital history on shifting sands - there's no solid foundation and thus we can't agree on what's true. There's no global megaphone that would keep all information globally accessible &amp; indexable. A global append-only log for data doesn't have the same requirements as a financial system which needs 100% uptime. The only thing that needs incentivization is data availability &amp; the ability for anyone to offer. There can be different modes of posting - maybe just a hash for content that could be on ipfs and whose contents might have different levels of storage guarantees.</p>
<p>We need everything that needs to bubble up to the top to do so.
sequencing &amp; discoverability is valuable. The ability for any piece of information to bubble up TO THE ABSOLUTE TOP is.. VALUABLE</p>
<p>information theory and physics are interlinked. In the physical world signals traverse based on the natural laws but memetic ideas spread thanks to human-manipulated means - we don't have fair means of dissipation of information. We can't make sense of the world together. We can't coordinate</p>
<p>The most powerful person in the world is the story teller. The storyteller sets the vision, values, and agenda of an entire generation that is to come - steve jobs</p>
<p>Finance and media are the bedrock of society.</p>
<p>bring back the nansi pelosi portfolio tracker</p>
<p>the only way to pay for open data is to make a currency that whoever owns it benefits from being on it. Make the voice of people unsilence-able - something pops up - immediately a few people copy it so even if the original goes down - the idea can be re-referenced by others anonymously - until it picks up steam and gets nocited by more</p>
<p>the trust machine may bootstrap the truth machine - where it is incentivized to pop up to the top and the only thing that makes things grow is actually being more interesting &amp; important. HEATMAP of links!</p>
<p>Imagine seeing both the data and the algorithms running on that data &amp; being able to check the results for yourself</p>
<p>Anyone will be able to follow a story locally - even with the files being deleted one after another - each time just the diff will be uploaded and you'll be notified for events relating to an address and have the ability to download it and apply it locally. This is an uncensorable global conversation.</p>
<p>the same piece of data may pop up multiple times throughout time through different sources - unkillable evidence - one which may live offline for a period and resurface. THERE NEEDS TO BE A GLOBAL HASH INDEX OF EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN EVER TAGGED?</p>
<p>I want to tag/link/index/sequence all data. I want the truth to bubble up.</p>
<p>&quot;Information wants to be free&quot;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free</p>
<p>we need to establish objective reality
we shouldn't need steven pinker to make lectures titled &quot;rationality saves lives&quot;
imagine developing a publicly-developed wiki where we collaborate on trying to figure out the best set of documents - the rules that everyone should see.</p>
<p>imagine being mad at your operating system because it has an agenda of its own. We are currently mad because media doesn't get the truth across but in fact there is no truth protocol for media - that's why they are bought - media cannot survive without its funding. Imagine building the OS that could show anyone where the hottest links of referencing are - where we are all collectively shining with attention -. Such a system will make it so the most pressing problems would surface the fastest to our collective consciousness. This is the unification</p>
<p>Linked data is essential for discoverability &amp; ingestion of information - this gitbook is an example of that - contrast to what it would be if it was a linear whitepaper. The whole web can be interlinked like this.</p>
<p>Organizing the information on the internet better

<p>Throughout history, decentralization has been a remarkably effective evolutionary strategy. Just ask the Fungi Kingdom, which has continuously thrived for over 1.3 billion years. Uniquely adaptive masters of survival, fungi forgo a central “brain” in favor of a mycelium network: a branching, underground root system that distributes control throughout the organism. Mycelium networks efficiently allocate resources, respond to external stimuli, and remain functional even if one part of the organism is destroyed.

If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.</p>
<p>As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.</p>
<p>This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.</p>
<p>lets try to achieve consensus on ground truth with the ledger of record

<p>lowest common denominator UX is fine but the power users should be able to go crazy - let them separate signal from noise on a global level</p>
<p>have you seen replies by people you don't follow in your twitter feed? why would &quot;X received a reply from someone you don't follow&quot; be in there? shouldn't there be a setting for that?</p>
<p>https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3
Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes.</p>

<p>by making data and identity interoperable between views it gets much easier for people to peek outside of their areas of interest and perhaps get drawn into other aspects of the world. It's all interconnected in the real world anyway, why not interconnect all data too and let ppl swim towards whatever they wish?</p>
<p>If someone has the fight in them, I think a great step would be to start documenting the power structure. Build a GitHub repo of all the laws. Discover who wrote which part of each bill. Track the financial relationships and flow of money. Build a Wikipedia to document our oligarchs. Reverse engineer their schedules. Trace their lineage. Document the behaviors in real time, do not let the regime continue to hide.

<p>github needs to be reimplemented on top of this - open source code is a public good - can be interwoven with peer review and public discourse. Any piece of data/event.</p>
<p>every journalist should be able to use something like logseq and construct their strories with referencable facts - timestamped &amp; cryptoi provable</p>
<p>promotion of videos will no longer be dominated just by the recommendation algorithm - when an influencer comments on a video his followers will see it and watch the said video too</p>
<p>We will be able to study the effects of recommendation algorithms for virality because all content has an interface where it came from</p>
<p>Interfaces will compete on the algorithms they let people use to filter and sort information - to look for signal through the noise.</p>
<p>segregated and disjoint discussion in the open web serves nobody - there should be canonical IDs for events &amp; information that we can all refer to and discussion can revolve around them</p>
<p>you can't link to a youtube comment - think about how limiting and yet obvious that is - comments there are just an afterthought</p>
<p>Write about the story for a journalist using a tool like that and constructing interlinked stories... that needs a page on its own</p>
<p>stable URLs help with returning back to a resource and checking all the discussion around it, also checking which of those that you follow have mentioned it</p>
<p>composing videos from clips with narration without losing the original context - movie maker of sorts</p>
<p>imagine a paragraph of a substack article to be retweetable and to be able to go viral while retaining the context of the whole - this is what composability could enable.</p>
<p>Generating content should be frictionless. Associating content with identity should be straightforward. Frictionless migration between views</p>
<p>even peer review can (and should) be reimplemented on top of this</p>
<p>universal &amp; permanent bookmarks.
bookmarks &amp; something like logseq on top of this global namespace</p>
<p>playlists are lists of bookmarks</p>
<p>you should be able to quote-comment any piece of science or media and have a threaded conversation with everyone. All publishing platforms will need to be plugged into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>it doesn't make sense to not be possible to comment on anything in the web and not have your followers see it. simply doesn't</p>
<p>Imagine having a single id for a film and have comment sections for each chapter or minute</p>
<p>each interface will specialize into providing the best possible service for the particular need/aspect of data consumption</p>
<p>ability to choose to see someone's reactions/comments or not when added in a list like twitter's lists - different types of levels of filtering for lists</p>
<p>how to construct a timeline of referenced facts &amp; news? incentive to link to a timeline?</p>
<p>special message tag type: referencing something as a fact - but that thing needs an UUID so ppl can look it up and see what's being commented about it over there</p>
<p>tagged posts with 1 main tag would simply appear both in a reddit-like ranking and subgroup grouping, and also in a twitter-like platform with default rendering (or optionally showing the tag).</p>
<p>imagine the twitter UX being merged with that of discord - less scrolling, more conversation</p>
<p>OMG
quoting sub-sections of pages through the internet archive
https://archive.ph/O2D45#selection-635.4-635.18</p>
<p>quote-retweet something - and then later when viewing the discussion around the original content to be able to view the discussion from quote-retweets 1 level deep as well, or even 2</p>
<p>Different views and who can delete/hide comments form them?
multiple competing &quot;subreddits&quot; on the same topic - basically differing on their moderation</p>

<p>what services will spring up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>search engines
Search is a very hard problem:
https://scribe.rip/p/what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-search-27d1df99f80d
Search engines will be plugged to the message bus and will see updates to old posts - simplifying the process of keeping indexes up-to-date - push vs pull. Same for the internet archive.</p>
<ul>
<li>user-generated activity around content will greatly impact how search functions</li>
<li>message schemas greatly simplify search &amp; indexing - &quot;hassle-free information extraction from dynamic websites&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Future of Search Is Boutique
https://future.a16z.com/the-future-of-search-is-boutique</p>
<p>Anchoring - easier for ngos to prove bias in results from opaque companies
Ephemeral experiences - search suggestions - no trace
for reference see Dr robert epstein's work
ALSO because all data is public, search engines could be compared &amp; scrutinized for bias
ALSO you could download locally apps such as a tiny google for yourself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>platforms to deploy interface apps without thinking about the infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS infrastructure companies that host plugin apps and deal with the heavy lifting of data processing</li>
<li>Your startup idea cant afford the infrastructure to process 100mb/s of ephemeral data? Pay a service a small fee for a subset of data you’re interested in for your PoC</li>
<li>Market for intermediate processed results &amp; indexes so that not everyone needs to reinvent the wheel and build the same set of algorithms and infrastructure over and over again - creating a market for the information pipeline by division of labor &amp; specialization. Any intermediate data structure could be checked for validity based on the inputs - albeit slow. Test but verify - opaque processing rules. No more algorithmic black boxes. Batch processing - web-scale services do that all the time and plenty of work is done on results that are minutes or even hours outdated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>archival services for the activity of specific users from the interface blobs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notifications for data references being referenced
data could be any data/resource/ID
with filtering
imagine being able to follow the activity of X person on any possible online venue - the all-encompassing public record</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>editors &amp; all forms of media will be able to refer to specific posts uniquely</p>
<ul>
<li>something like #seq!&lt;interface_id/interface_nonce/user_id/content_stuff&gt; which could prompt an index lookup in your editor
<ul>
<li>along with competing indexers</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>imagine wikipedia being rebuilt on top of this</p>
<ul>
<li>dead links? thing of the past - can be cached locally &amp; preserved with merkle proofs</li>
<li>imagine wikipedia being forked with a different set of moderators - like in git</li>
<li>imagine rebuilding wikipedia on top of this graph and being able to reference each paragraph/change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine the web archive build around this</p>
<ul>
<li>when archiving media only the important parts would be saved
<ul>
<li>snapshots would be created only when a new anchored publish event occurs</li>
<li>no redundant snapshots</li>
<li>no saving of unrelated data &amp; html</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>being able to subscribe to changes of pages in websites that don't have an ID (not through follow (because they don't have an ID) but by other means)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine the possible visualizations on the graph data of the hivemind</p>
<ul>
<li>imagine a 3d spacial graph of the interconnected knowledge you should learn, and how as you progress you color the edges to the ideas you're studiying on as a progress bar. continue from wherever you want after pausing, explore the datapoints &amp; the interconnectedness. Imagine shipping a 5GB graph in such software for anyone to experience the ideas someone is trying to communicate to them</li>
<li>imagine creating explanatory videos for each edge (connections between things in life) - saying how the 2 things interplay, and why</li>
<li>imagine wearing a VR headset while constructing your stories as graphs constructed with anchored data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>you'll have the option to subscribe (not on-chain but through an interface) to quotes &amp; references of content that interest you - seeing what the reception is and how that unfolds</p>

problems: relying on their ceramic pinning service for data persistence, requires explicit key signatures, focus on financial accounts &amp; linking them
https://discord.com/channels/901233976138682388/901234959623286825/959420114472669235
My question in their discord: Hello! Your documentation says Long-term data retention is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and our custom data pinning service. and I was wondering what would the long-term incentive for the pinning service be, and if the DAO token you'll be launching soon will be tied to the economic incentive for nodes to store the ever-expanding graph?
Also how big do you see the graph getting? My napkin math for Twitter's 400M users and 700 average connections shows that if using simple 4 byte integers as IDs (no pubkeys/signatures/DIDs) would require 1.1TB of data for the most compact version of the graph (each ID would have an array of IDs that it follows) being able to answer queries like who does X follow and for queries like who follows X the data would need to be 2x bigger (another set of arrays). In reality it would be much more because of other metadata, keys, signatures, bigger integers (to support more than 4 billion indexes), database overhead, etc. Thoughts? </p>

&quot;However, a downside I’ve observed in social networks where content is monetized is that user behavior becomes transparently driven by monetary incentives in ways that feel less genuine. This applies to influencer culture on Instagram as well, but cryptocurrency social networks bake it in from the start.&quot;

<p>biggest difference with farcaster is the push vs pull model and the use of delegated interfaces that batch user content</p>
<p>The network effect is not related to data fetching and the implementation of that but of stable data addressing and user connections. Farcaster is implementing the wrong thing</p>
<p>You might need a specialized blockchain in order to compete.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to build on top of an open social graph and create new interfaces for displaying, sharing &amp; interacting with data. I can provide a full list of everything I'd want from the web.</p>
<p>Design for 1B ppl from day 1</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why Ethereum?</p>
<ul>
<li>what would the setup look like for 1B ppl? Is building your own chain an option at some point?</li>
<li>because of the ability to sell the handle as an nft? Markets can be done on a specialized chain too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>syncing the activity of specific accounts (those who you follow) vs all accounts by default</p>
<ul>
<li>your idea makes that easy</li>
<li>my idea makes it hard (have to scan everything published - easily 10-20+ MB/s</li>
<li>but syncing everything by default makes it easier in this scenario:
<ul>
<li>X follows Y</li>
<li>Y posts a comment to a post from Z</li>
<li>X gets the comment from Y but now also needs to fetch the post from Z ==&gt; more lookups
<ul>
<li>actually you don't have a cast schema for replies to other ppl's posts yet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is your network effect and where is the lock-in? The contract? Cant that be copied?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just the name registry is not enough for a standalone chain</p>
<ul>
<li>with the 2 ideas merged there is merit for a standalone chain
https://i.imgflip.com/6bc8w7.jpg</li>
<li>there will be a lot more block space demand if all connections &amp; the &quot;Host Directory&quot; are moved on chain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>managed hosts could hold you hostage even if you have your keys</p>
<ul>
<li>backups help, but too much hassle</li>
<li>even if you start using a different host, you'd have lost your follower list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For access control management you need guaranteed data availability &amp; sequencing</p>
<ul>
<li>my design makes that very easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my design no special-purpose nodes are required - IPFS &amp; ceramic streams can be leveraged</p>
<p>FARCASTER TODO: I don't get the peer2peer part of it &amp; the nodes &amp; stuff</p>
<p>Is there any way I could ask your team some questions? Some group chat perhaps?</p>
<p>I'd love to pick your brains and also share my design - it's also minimalistic in terms of what goes on chain</p>
<p>I've done an analysis of your solution vs mine with pros/cons and how they could be merged.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the &quot;Handling Transfers&quot; part can be avoided with a global sequencer

TODO: rethink this &amp; re-read it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your &quot;v2 Design&quot; talks about p2p delivery of messages but why is that necessary if there's a link to the &quot;Host Directory&quot; and it can be polled?</p>
<ul>
<li>are messages expected to propagate to all nodes?</li>
<li>can this handle 50MB/s of traffic?</li>
<li>why not use IPFS/Ceramic streams &amp; a global sequencer like my idea?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>your design better guarantees the data availability of the content from a user</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hello Varun,</p>
<p>I had a call with Avichal from Electric Capital yesterday because I was pitching him an idea how to decentralize the social graph but at scale, and he mentioned that I should look at Farcaster. There's overlap and </p>
<p>I'm 100% on board with the idea of putting content off-chain</p>
<p>equity - token? normal company?</p>
<p>You mention Solidity &amp; Ethereum addresses - will the registry live there?</p>
<p>Not US timezone - I'm from Europe. But I could move to an American time zone</p>
<p>Why Solidity... Why general-purpose smart contracts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>unique indexes vs handles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integers for users/interfaces/blocks/nonces are important for referencability &amp; indexability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with on-chain delegation &amp; sequencing (the concept of time) users may not need pubkeys for the messages they have signed because those messages will reference interface nonces &amp; blocks so spoofing will still not be possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>host-centric blobs (user-specific) vs interleaved with the oactivity of other users, posted through interfaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple hosts at the same time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will you have a token and how would it accrue value? what is this 1% equity you offer for new hires?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFAIU hosts only deal with storing data, but many different &amp; competing interfaces could be built that utilize the hosts for data storage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delegation could be implemented in your system as well.
delegation is key!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the Host Directory should go on chain too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sequencing &amp; anchoring is important !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is the long-term vision of the project - it's own chain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isn't this design very poll-heavy? What if there are 1 billion users and each of them generates 2-3 follow events per day?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the plan seems to be that you'd subsidize gas fees on ethereum in the begining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a &quot;follow&quot; event part of a &quot;cast&quot; as a signed blob?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how would you guard against spam/sybil attack &amp; people capturing the best handles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the &quot;sufficient decentralization&quot; post &amp; the docs don't make this point, but I think multiple interfaces could be using the same (managed) host.
don't write this - because this is in the docs:
&quot;A host should not be confused with an application which is a higher-order construct that may include a host, client and other services.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on-chain registry's performance when checking for duplicate names?
not a problem IMHO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smart contracts user for things like &quot;a feature where you can restrict replies to a message to users who own a specific asset&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any way to make it possible for users to not need keypairs and just use plain old email login? Something like OAuth with the ability to later bind a keypair to a user identity if need be? Delegation &amp; access control management?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what I can do</p>
<ul>
<li>presenting, meme lording, writing text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>shouldn't it be called farcast &amp; the users a farcaster?</p>
<ul>
<li>dont send this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>signing every message &amp; action is a PITA - would prohibit true mass adoption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merklization &amp; anchoring removes the need for the hash chain of casts and sequencing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFAIU any number of different interfaces/frontends could be implemented that could work with your host? So a host is providing access to your data &amp; actions that you have signed, and any number of interfaces (twitter, youtube, medium, reddit) could be using your host to store the data once you generate it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have you thought about the push vs pull design and if it's possible to combine the 2 to provide the best performance &amp; usability for devs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like this poll-heavy design - instead I think all content should be merklized &amp; andvertized on a chain and interfaces should simply process all data by default</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>light clients that can be ran locally by users would benefit from a poll architecture as opposed to mine :|</p>
<ul>
<li>why not merge both and provide both ways of getting data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>My architecture isn't poll-based and has it's own chain that stores the follow graph along with </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>farcaster is also compatible with hosts managing your keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if a managed host responsible for millions of accounts goes away, how much time would it take for everyone to update the URLs to their hosts through the Ethereum contract?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rewriting of the history of a user is near impossible in my design - no need for clients to keep track of old hashes to posts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the p2p system for nodes to sync data... won't scale with fine-grained messages signed by unique keys in a truly web-scale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my solution doesn't suffer from conflicts &amp; the eventual consistency problems of farcaster

<p>edge case: what happens if a big interface suddenly becomes malicious? How can millions of ppl invalidate activity posted through it without clogging the network?
- force interfaces to bond tokens (proportional to the # of delegators) so that if a fork is necessary, they get penalized.

<ul>
<li>users without keypairs are screwed</li>
<li>users with keypairs will be sending on-chain messages but those will be huge and will clog the network
<ul>
<li>possible solution: batch them off-chain into 1000 batches, construct BLS aggregate sigs, sign a msg &amp; transmit that along with a bitmap for which keys participated in the batching to a block.
Users will need to coordinate off-chain &amp; decide from which block to revoke the access, which other ACM should be approved, etc. This can be used in other scenarios too.

With verifiable computation, these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.
We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.</p>

The most common suggestion we received in regards to our CSAM problem was to connect our website to Facebook and send them every single file that our users upload, so that Facebook can scan the file and tell us whether the file should be allowed on our website. A similar service is offered by Microsoft, and I believe Apple and Google each have something as well.</p>

<p>Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

<p>You go to rollups with your capital to transact and exchange - with Headjack you wont be able to take your state back with you to L1 because the entirety of headjack is the state</p>
<p>Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity &amp; interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus</p>
<p>A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case</p>
<p>No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum &amp; is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains</p>
<p>I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.</p>
<p>finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability &amp; retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block &amp; the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...</p>
<p>Finance is about preservation of energy - the double spend problem
And thus scalability there is different from media scalability which is a data problem</p>
<p>Media is about data access and sequence</p>
