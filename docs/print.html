<p>Headjack is a blockchain that links sovereign identities to content at <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">web-scale</a>. Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation is fundamentally different from transfers and exchange of value - the design space around trust &amp; data availability for media and identity is different from finance.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
It is not about less or more trust but about better trust.

Headjack is about better trust - not trustlessness

creational - not transactional

# Motto: <s>TRUSTLESS</s> ***BETTER TRUST***

Headjack does sequencing of events.

Breaking apart identity and media allows for better incentives

it does not deal with storage and neither with routing - any kind of routing can be implemented on top of it with the advantage of addressing content in bulk or by source (publisher or creator)

 -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">UNIX philosophy</a> - in Headjack identity is simply an identifier (unique number) and anything orthogonal (KYC, profiles, privacy, finance) can be layered on top of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It solves single sign-on and allows for user experience similar to Web2 through <a href="identity.html">hierarchical authorization management</a> - keypairs are not required by default and even those with keys bound to their accounts may choose to not explicitly sign every interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consensus is reached on the absolute bare minimum - the history of authorizations, names, keys &amp; off-chain content anchors (merkle roots) - the simplest mental model for developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headjack can support <strong>billions</strong> of accounts and link <strong>unlimited</strong> amounts of off-chain activity to them. The <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">entire web</a> can be rebuilt on top of it - a claim that is <a href="numbers.html">easily provable</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="addressing.html">Content addressing</a> is with persistent &amp; human-readable URIs (instead of hashes) - the link between identity and data is cryptographically provable even if keys &amp; names have changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't deal with off-chain data storage and retrievability - those are separate problems and Headjack simply lets entities point to ways for others to retrieve addressable content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - The move from the current [host-centric](problems_with_the_web.md#the-host-centric-web) web towards [data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing represents a paradigm shift around data ownership & access - an architectural reset of the internet. -->

<h1 id="guiding-principles--design-goals"><a class="header" href="#guiding-principles--design-goals">Guiding principles &amp; design goals</a></h1>
<p>These are the guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption of Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="principles.html#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">Web-scale, blockspace &amp; the UNIX philosophy</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">Decentralization, neutrality &amp; sovereignty</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux"><a class="header" href="#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></h1>
<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="competition.html">most of the competing attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. There are a few aspects to retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to:</p>
<img src="images/meme_make_them_learn.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 8px; width: 35%">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody wants to deal with keys, wallets &amp; self-custody because of all the headaches &amp; complexities that come along with that. Creation &amp; media are different from exchange &amp; finance and it's OK to trust by default as long as there's <a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">a fallback</a>. We should be aiming for <strong>better trust</strong> instead of trustlessness at the cost of UX. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; passwords or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize applications to post on their behalf without requiring keys &amp; signatures - by delegating trust. This way the majority of Web2 identity &amp; authentication plumbing can be reused with Headjack underneath as just another backend. <code>&quot;Sign-in with Ethereum&quot;</code> doesn't scale - we should aim for familiarity.</p>

<p>&quot;The future of mass-market crypto experiences lies within apps that provide familiar, custodial experiences with the ability to graduate into non-custodial experiences.&quot; - <a href="https://future.a16z.com/missing-link-web2-web3-custody-wallets/">a16z</a></p>

<p>&quot;If the goal is to onboard first-time crypto users, the experience must be custodial — at least to start.&quot; - <a href="https://future.a16z.com/missing-link-web2-web3-custody-wallets/">a16z</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data &amp; blockchain interactions by default - costs &amp; complexity should be abstracted away &amp; shifted to services in the background. Self-hosting is the opposite of <a href="https://twitter.com/arvanaghi/status/1537519858233008128">customer obsession</a> - let's aim for simplicity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;People don’t want to run their own servers, and never will.&quot; - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">Moxie</a></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content addressing should be with human-friendly URIs with names &amp; numbers instead of being full of hashes - typical for Web3. We're used to adequate URLs where the domain of the platform/website &amp; even the user name are present when identifying content - hashes make URIs much longer &amp; harder to remember. Contrast that to <a href="addressing.html">Headjack's addressing</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The applications built on top of the network must match the responsiveness of Web2 and exceed its functionality. <code>&quot;Latency is not an option anymore&quot;</code> - Amazon <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">found</a> that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales. 16 years ago Google <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">found</a> an extra 500ms in search page generation time dropped traffic by 20% - our irritable nature hasn't changed. Web2 isn't going anywhere - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><code>&quot;market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization&quot;</code></a> dictate that the best services will be running on huge server racks in data centers with sophisticated caches &amp; batch processing infrastructure due to data gravity.</p>

<p>Headjack follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">UNIX philosophy</a> - it focuses only on <a href="identity.html">identity</a> (identifiers represented as numbers &amp; name ownership) &amp; linking data/actions to it without trying to do anything orthogonal (data storage, KYC, profiles, privacy, finance, etc.) that can be layered on top. It doesn't impose constraints on what could be built around it - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>. All kinds of systems with their own incentives, cryptoeconomics &amp; guarantees can be implemented on top of this identity layer &amp; <a href="addressing.html">addressing</a>. The on-chain vs off-chain tradeoff and what goes into the blockspace is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consensus should be reached on the absolute bare minimum - only <a href="identity.html">identity</a> (integers), the history of keypairs &amp; authorizations, name ownership &amp; anchors to off-chain activity need <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logical centralization</a> and must be on-chain with guaranteed data availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All other activity &amp; data is stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> &amp; other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time. Most of it won't be stored forever but any piece can be backed up through archives &amp; <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>. Events get cryptographically anchored with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle roots</a> to the chain so that permissions, inclusion &amp; sequence are provable.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="identity--authorization"><a class="header" href="#identity--authorization">Identity &amp; authorization</a></h1>
<p>There are 3 types of roles in Headjack (although a single entity may play all 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing applications to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke the authorization). They will also be responsible for handling DMs as discussed <a href="IDM.html#dms">here</a>.</li>
<li>Applications - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space.</p>
<img src="images/sequenced_integer_relations.png">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; applications with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to applications using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the application with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to applications and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an application by saying <code>&quot;discard activity generated through application А from block X forward&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - it is still an enormous improvement compared to the current Web2 status quo.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Applications will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions) will need explicit signatures.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/authorizations.png">
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; Merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="images/meme_integers_and_relations.jpg">
<p>In practice, we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly authorizations) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be lightweight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. At any point in time, they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath applications.</p>

<h1 id="todays-web-host-centric"><a class="header" href="#todays-web-host-centric">Today's web: host-centric</a></h1>
<p>Today's web revolves around hosts &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast">unicast</a> communication - we query <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> to get the IP of servers and open direct connections with them to retrieve the data that they host. But domains, URI paths on servers &amp; the actual files all change &amp; go away which leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> &amp; content drift. Guidance such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">&quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;</a> is just that - guidance - and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> is just a bandaid that can hardly keep up with the digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a>. In the host-certified paradigm URLs at best point to a location at which a document may have been available at some point in time - devoid of any cryptographic proofs regarding the contents, the creator, an alternative way to retrieve it or the time of publication. The implications are explored in the <a href="problems_with_the_web.html#the-host-centric-web">host-centric section in the motivation</a>.</p>
<h1 id="data-centric-computing"><a class="header" href="#data-centric-computing">Data-centric computing</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-centric_computing">Data-centric computing</a> is an emerging concept that has relevance in information architecture and data center design - data is stored independently of the applications, which can be upgraded without costly and complicated data migration. This is a radical shift in information systems that will be needed to address organizational needs for storing, retrieving, moving, and processing exponentially growing data sets. It increases agility by prioritizing data transfer and data computation. Applications become short-lived, constantly added, updated, or removed as algorithms come and go.</p>

<h1 id="content-addressable-storage"><a class="header" href="#content-addressable-storage">Content-addressable storage</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-addressable storage</a> (CAS) is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content (not its location/name) and is a key piece of the puzzle. Identifiers are based on content and any change to a data element will necessarily change its content address. The most famous example of CAS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> but it suffers from non-human-friendly addresses (hashes), performance issues, and extreme latency (tens of minutes) because of the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> if content is not widely cached/pinned.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">Self-authenticating data</a> moves authority from hosts to users. The three components that enable it are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic identifiers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">CAS</a>, and an emerging area of research called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> which is yet to be applied in any meaningful scale.</p>
<h1 id="information-centric-networking"><a class="header" href="#information-centric-networking">Information-centric networking</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking">Information-centric networking</a> (ICN) is an approach to evolving the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information (or content or data). Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand, and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. In information-centric networking, the cache is a network-level solution, and it has rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, and smaller cache sizes.</p>
<h1 id="named-data-networking"><a class="header" href="#named-data-networking">Named Data Networking</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking">Named Data Networking</a> (NDN) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Internet">Future Internet</a> architecture that builds on top of the previous ideas (&amp; an incarnation of ICN) and in which data is requested by name and routed by the network. However, there are many unsolved challenges with it like the need to reimplement foundational routing infrastructure to make it stateful and hierarchically structured names which require a root name authority to link them to keypairs - outside of its scope. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM">a great lecture</a> on the topic.</p>
<h1 id="enter-headjack---the-final-iteration"><a class="header" href="#enter-headjack---the-final-iteration">Enter Headjack - the final iteration</a></h1>
<p>Headjack is a weird amalgamation inspired by everything above - it provides human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> for self-authenticating data (with <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proofs</a> &amp; the blockchain) along with the means for its retrieval without forcing a specific way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> is just one option). It acts as the web-scale global index used to check the authenticity of documents (requires consulting with the chain), ownership of names, key management &amp; sequence of events throughout time. It is an addressability layer on top of the current host-centric internet technologies.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="blobs--persistent-uris"><a class="header" href="#blobs--persistent-uris">Blobs &amp; persistent URIs</a></h1>

<h1 id="blob-construction---batching-of-user-events"><a class="header" href="#blob-construction---batching-of-user-events">Blob construction - batching of user events</a></h1>
<p>Applications accumulate off-chain activity from users which they cryptographically anchor in batches with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> on-chain and they determine how often to do so (it doesn't have to be on every block) - those with little activity may submit only once per minute or even less often - the frequency is determined by applications based on the volume of activity and the on-chain publishing costs.</p>
<p>When enough activity has been collected it is time for the application to finalize the batch: it is packed in a blob and all the events generated since the last anchored batch are sorted &amp; grouped by accounts in some deterministic way (perhaps accounts based on index and actions based on the type/sequence) with some schema with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intra-blob index (offset table) for lookup of content of specific accounts is generated.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> that touches every event is deterministically constructed following a schema.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) for the blob is generated and it is pinned for others to download.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only 2 things that are signed &amp; submitted on-chain are thus the Merkle root and the IPFS CID for the next nonce (auto-increment counter) associated with the application account.</p>
<img src="images/blob_structure.png">
<!-- <object width=100% data="images/blob_structure.svg"></object> -->
<h1 id="stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing"><a class="header" href="#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a></h1>
<p>Applications maintain the logical order of events for the future batch in maps in order to provide intra-blob addressing even before it is fully constructed - as an example if a user posts an article and immediately after that comments on their own post - the comment should be able to refer to the post which is not yet committed on-chain. Applications will also display activity by other accounts that is not yet anchored and the interactions can still use the proper addressing when referring to the yet-to-be-anchored messages (the next nonce number is known in advance). Any type of interaction is addressable and sequenced in the blobs - including reactions (likes, etc).</p>
<h1 id="persistent--provable-uris"><a class="header" href="#persistent--provable-uris">Persistent &amp; provable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a></a></h1>
<p>Each account has an associated auto-increment counter (nonce) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content. So if an application has submitted 2 times already, then the next submission will be with <code>nonce == 3</code>. The blockchain keeps a mapping in its state for each previous nonce value to the block number when it changed so that <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> can be translated to which block has the Merkle root anchor &amp; <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> for the blob that corresponds to that nonce for that account.</p>
<!-- The 2 can be extracted from the block. -->
<img src="images/blob_URI.png">
<p>Once a blob is fetched through the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) we can address specific events by using the offset index in the blob header so a URI like <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_id&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> can point to a specific post, comment or even reaction (activity is grouped by users). The content ID for a specific user is usually a small single-digit number and is necessary only if there has been more than 1 interaction by that user through that application for the given nonce (maybe rare). This is what events with URIs referring to each other looks like:</p>
<img src="images/content_references.png">
<p>The blockchain can be queried if the application was allowed to post content on behalf of the user with an on-chain authorization (which probably happened through an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) when that specific block was published in order to determine if the activity is authentic - the state keeps information for each account such as since what block number a given application was authorized to post on behalf of a user (and until when - all ranges). Users may avoid using IDMs and explicitly sign their actions in which case their data will be accompanied by their signatures within the data blobs and the only check required will be for the user keypair used for the specific block number.</p>
<h1 id="steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri">Steps to prove the authenticity of a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap - to prove the authenticity of any event with a URI:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the data is actually part of an anchored blob with a <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proof</a> to a block. This requires either just the piece of data + a Merkle proof for inclusion in the blob or the entire blob in order to reconstruct the Merkle tree &amp; proof.</li>
<li>Then check if the user actually submitted the event:
<ul>
<li>Either if at that point the application was authorized to post on behalf of the user which would require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (authorization ranges).</li>
<li>Or by checking for an explicit signature &amp; the public key of that account at that time which would also require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (account key history).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>URIs are persistent as long as someone hosts either the individual event + the Merkle proof or the entire blob (and can reconstruct the proof) and knows to which block it was anchored (from the <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;block_number&gt;</code> mapping). The <a href="names_and_paths.html">following chapter</a> shows how names in URIs are persistent too (even if user/application names change ownership at some point).</p>
<h1 id="a-few-other-notes"><a class="header" href="#a-few-other-notes">A few other notes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>There can be many different &amp; valid proofs for the same URI from different block heights.</li>
<li>Even private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">intranet</a> data may be anchored but not retrievable by the public if the blob IPFS CID is never published or pinned/hosted - unified addressing for public &amp; private.</li>
<li>Users should be able to see the URI of content even if created through another application and the origin should be displayed by default - acting as <a href="business_models.html">attribution for other applications</a>.</li>
<li>Edits &amp; updates to content come as <a href="messages.html">messages</a> with new unique URIs that reference the older message URIs and it is up to applications to properly handle this - either by showing that there have been changes and a newer version or automatically redirect to the latest. &quot;Forks&quot; are possible but they represent application failure to detect that an old version is being edited.</li>
<li>Accounts that anchor content on-chain cannot do so twice in the same block - for simplicity.</li>

# On proof permanence

One thing to consider is if a user revokes the authorization of an application to post on their behalf retroactively - not just going forward but also invalidating all anchored content & follow/unfollow events for the last couple of days through that application. This would mean that cached Merkle proofs for such invalidated content will no longer be valid and the latest state of the blockchain will refuse to produce new such proofs, but the cached proofs could mislead someone. Retroactive revocation can happen only up to `X` days to limit the scope of changes to cached proofs & what infrastructure would need to handle but still give enough time for anyone to react in case an application has posted fraudulent activity on their behalf - a **mostly theoretical concern**. Proofs for blocks older than `X` days are therefore considered permanent.

<p>Headjack is also a name registry - accounts can own a handle and be identified with it. There have been other attempts to decentralize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namecoin">Namecoin</a> and <a href="https://handshake.org/">Handshake</a> but a much stronger network effect is necessary in order to succeed. Headjack is a confluence of multiple interrelated things (identity, names, authorization &amp; addressing) and has the potential to truly decentralize DNS. For specifics around the details (constraints, subdomains, auctions, distribution, hoarding, leasing, etc.) please refer to <a href="handles.html">their dedicated page</a>. In this chapter:</p>

<h1 id="names-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#names-in-uris">Names in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Users and applications don't need a name and can operate as an integer index just fine, but the preferred case will be with handles. Names can change ownership but the blockchain will be able to translate <code>&lt;application_name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> with strings into the canonical integer form discussed <a href="uris.html">previously</a> by substituting the application &amp; user names with account IDs.</p>
<p>Every name has an associated auto-increment nonce (just like account IDs) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content and the blockchain records maps of <code>&lt;name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> which can then be used to resolve the URI as discussed in the <a href="uris.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>
<img src="images/account_name_state.png">
<p>But we need to be able to translate not just the application name but also the user name which may have changed ownership at any point - for that the blockchain keeps track of the account ID ownership of every name historically as ranges (from block X to block Y name N was owned by account A) so when we determine the block number for a given data blob we'd be able to check to which account ID does a name in a URI correspond to at that time.</p>
<!-- Additionally the user name <=> account ID mapping at the time of the blob could be embedded within the blob header (along with proofs) so that fewer queries are necessary to the blockchain. -->
<p>And thus we're able to have URIs such as <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> to identify any event by any actor - all we'd need to do is a few lookups and we'll be able to use Merkle proofs for any piece of content to prove authenticity. Most URIs could even omit the 4th part because probably there won't be more than 1 action by a user for a given batch by an application.</p>
<p>Note that the canonical form (numbers instead of names) of <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> could be something like <code>42/783/523/3</code> where only the last number would be the same and the nonce would most likely be different. Also <code>twitter.com</code> might no longer be owned by account <code>42</code> but what matters is that the blockchain can correctly determine who owned it at nonce <code>55212</code>. Multiple names can be owned by an account but their nonces for one event will probably be different.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri">What to ask the blockchain about a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap: we can ask the following questions about this URI: <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>To which application account ID &amp; nonce does <code>twitter.com/55212</code> correspond?</li>
<li>To which block does the applicationID/nonce map correspond?</li>
<li>What is the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> &amp; Merkle root of the anchored blob at that block?</li>
<li>What account ID does <code>johnny</code> correspond to in the block where this blob was anchored?</li>
<li>Once we download the blob or just the blob header (using the IPFS CID or any other means):
<ol>
<li>We can ask the offset table where within the blob is <code>johnny</code>'s content № <code>3</code>?</li>
<li>Once we fetch the actual data &amp; depending on whether it is explicitly signed or not:
<ol>
<li>either if the application was authorized to post on behalf of <code>johnny</code> at that time,</li>
<li>or if the signature matches the keypair that's been bound to <code>johnny</code>'s account at the time of the anchored block.</li>

<p>Application accounts can point on-chain to a host with an IP address which can be used to display content published through them. Application names can also resemble traditional domain names so it will be possible to copy-paste such URIs directly into your browser and as long as they own the same domain in the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> they should be able to serve a webpage displaying the piece of content - enabling seamless interoperability during the transition from one paradigm to the other.</p>
<h1 id="content-titles-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#content-titles-in-uris">Content titles in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Most Web3 platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1537388439259291649">suffer from unreadable URIs</a> but we've done a lot better - note the brevity and lack of hashes &amp; hexadecimal symbols (<code>0xf56a0...</code>) - in fact, this is as good as it gets...</p>
<p><strong>Or is it?!</strong> What about headlines of articles - can we have them included as well - something like <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3/how-I-went-from-vegan-to-keto-and-back-again</code>? Absolutely! The string is not at all necessary to resolve the piece of content (just like in StackOverflow where the database key for a question is just a number (example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4">question 4</a>) but the page router always changes the URL when loading the page to include the title too). <a href="messages.html">Message types</a> for posts with titles will have a dedicated field which will get included in the content hash and thus spoofing the title will be rejected by conforming applications as it would be a trivial check.</p>

<h1 id="addressing-within-content"><a class="header" href="#addressing-within-content">Addressing within content</a></h1>
<p>Different schemas could be used for addressing within pieces of content (like a paragraph from an article or a clip from audio/video - without losing the context of the whole) and message types could have by default associated on-chain schemas (or the schema of choice could be embedded within the header of the message). For example, when <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/121/66</code> is being loaded the associated schema will be looked up depending on the type of message (in this case - an article) and used to interpret the last part (<code>121/66</code>) which could mean a character selection with an offset from the start and length. The embedded schema could be overridden by explicitly stating which one to use within the URI. As an example, <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/schema/42/121/187</code> could mean <code>&quot;use on-chain schema number 42&quot;</code> which could interpret the last part (<code>121/187</code>) as start offset and end offset instead of start &amp; length - resulting in the same selection as before. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1544001073844731904">individual pages &amp; paragraphs of books</a> should be referencable in such a manner and could be composed of multiple separate posts - and this is just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>For big types of content (audio/video) the message could be broken down into chunks so that users can load only the message header and then depending on the schema used and the addressing within the content - only the necessary chunks could be requested.</p>

- if a reply message has the URI to the original in non canonical form it would be harder for infrastructure to match those - it would have to translate the string URI to a number URI

interest graph & how it works off-chain

TODO: change interest graph related things in other pages & pictures

- per account graph state? a materialized tree of the current state based on all prior events - both off-chain & on-chain?

- remove the focus on the interest graph - it will be off-chain!
    - also from all graphics!




1 of N requirement for keeping the interest graph intact & being able to recover it from somewhere


the graph could be moved on-chain if there are many MB/s of DB throughput (possibly sharding) but that would put a lot of strain on the 


myspace-like page  (or linktree-like) where you paint the picture of you - as a map or as whatever - but content shouldn't be owned by separate platforms


Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering & exclusion of content based on its type/tag or application that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.




In Headjack all connections in the [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) are asymmetric and also visible & on-chain as it is geared towards [public discourse](https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks) but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - handled & stored by [IDMs](IDM.md) with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) and focusing on that aspect first greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect - propagation & reach are sought after. Identities will have their own customized landing pages off-chain through an IDM.



- `follows` (`array[integer]`) - list of accounts that it follows
    - `followers` (`array[integer]`) - a list of accounts that follow it (redundant - can be reconstructed by scanning all accounts - for faster queries of the other sort)

- Twitter: 400M users (220 MAU), average connections: 700
- 1.1 TB for arrays of arrays with 4 byte integers (the graph)
    - 2.2 TB (x2) if storing connections both ways for faster lookups (who do I follow & who follows me)
    - 4.4 TB (x2) if using long long int (8 bytes) - infinite indexes
- Metadata (pubkey, handle, description) per index would be O(1)
    - Less than the bytes required for 700 connections on average
- Realistic state size: ~20TB - database overhead & merkle roots
- The entire Twitter graph can be populated in a month with 1 MB/s of blockchain bandwidth



- private connections, posts & user data
    - see 4.2.2 Privacy (basically encrypted connections/actions and secrets shared/delegated to applications to operate on behalf of actor)
    even encrypted direct messaging could be implemented on top of this

- The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity & connections being the most valuable - a clear example is [Substack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack) (basically [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) but you own the mailing list for your audience). The [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking & ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the [essential crown jewel](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681) that needs preservation - the global [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). The data availability (DA - storage & retrievability) for identity & the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.

<p>In this chapter we will see the different aspects of handling unlimited amounts of off-chain data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="store_and_retrieve.html#ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data">Ingestion and transformation of blob data</a></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data"><a class="header" href="#ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data">Ingestion and transformation of blob data</a></h1>
<p>Off-chain blobs with data will be fetched, processed and stored immediately after they are published in more optimal database formats for content to be later directly served by application infrastructure. Most of the cryptography checks will be happening instantly during this process but the proofs don't need to be stored. Users will always be able to request proofs for any event at any time (&amp; cache them locally) because they can be regenerated on the fly as necessary.</p>
<h1 id="hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches">Hierarchical data blobs &amp; partial fetches</a></h1>
<p>Blobs may be in a hierarchy such that the on-chain IPFS hash points only to the &quot;root&quot; blob that contains the header and the actual indexed data could be in child IPFS blobs (whose <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CIDs</a> are contained in the root blob or header) so entities listening for events by specific accounts on Headjack may download only these headers and determine which &quot;leaf&quot; blobs they need to fetch for the data they are interested in (if any). Sparse bitsets &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filters</a> could be used to quickly scan for the presence of activity by specific accounts.</p>
<img src="images/root_child_blob_separation.png">
<h1 id="direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling"><a class="header" href="#direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling">Direct IPFS connections &amp; horizontal scaling</a></h1>
<p>Applications can advertise the multiaddress of their IPFS nodes on-chain so that each blob of content that gets published can be downloaded by others instantly by manually connecting with IPFS’s <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/speeding-up-ipfs-pinning-through-swarm-connections-b509b1471986">“swarm connect” functionality</a> - avoiding the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> for each new blob CID which may take tens of minutes. They can provide addresses to multiple IPFS nodes as a cluster for horizontal scaling and use <a href="https://ipfscluster.io/">Pinset orchestration</a> - designed for Automated data availability and redundancy.</p>
<p>Applications may choose not to use IPFS at all - what they must do is anchor their blobs with a Merkle root and provide some on-chain advertised means to retrieve the data (example: REST/RPC endpoints in their on-chain account). We expect that IPFS will be the lowest common denominator and will always be used no matter what other solutions are also available.</p>
<h1 id="sharing-data-before-anchoring-it"><a class="header" href="#sharing-data-before-anchoring-it">Sharing data before anchoring it</a></h1>
<p>Applications can talk to each other directly by using their on-chain advertised REST/RPC endpoints and may ask for the events &amp; messages that are not yet published by the other applications. This way they could display &quot;remote&quot; events locally while they are still in the &quot;mempool&quot; and allow their own users to interact with those events from other applications. This is possible because URIs are stable even before publication - see <a href="blobs_and_uris.html#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a>. High activity applications can interoperate and no longer be a slave to the block time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications should display events that are not yet anchored in the UI differently - especially if coming from another application.</li>
<li>Events that refer to each other but are from different applications and have not yet been anchored on-chain could end up committed in the wrong order (if one of the applications skips a few blocks and commits at a later one) - such that an event from the past is referring to an event from the future - breaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">referential integrity</a>. However, <a href="messages.html">messages</a> have a timestamp field and could also have the current block height at the time of creation - useful for sorting.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri"><a class="header" href="#how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri">How to retrieve data for a random URI</a></h1>
<p>There are multiple options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire original blob with an <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> might still be retrievable from the original application account that posted it or anyone else that has pinned the data.</li>
<li>The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages.</li>
<li>Other well-known players without a direct on-chain connection to the application/user in a URI could be asked if they have the content:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure companies that do the heavy lifting for applications and store everything.</li>
<li>The analog of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> in this ecosystem that also stores everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPFS can be forked &amp; reused with the following change: instead of delivering content based on the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a> hash it can deliver the data + the necessary proofs based on Headjack URIs or their hash (they are unique) - any individual off-chain message that's been anchored would be retrievable as long as someone is hosting it in this p2p network (which needs bootstrapping - could be part of Headjack nodes). However, this won't be very performant due to the granular nature of individual messages with a URI and the use of a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>.</li>

Look at ethereum block & state structure
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/


with small pieces of data the proofs for them could be orders of magnitude bigger - with Headjack storing them is not necessary as they can be derived from the original data blobs and the current state of the chain - a small core capable of producing the proofs for unlimited amounts of off-chain content

== there are 2 aspects when linking identity to a piece of data:

- merkle proof linking the data to a block
    - entities needs to keep either:
        - the full IPFS blobs and no merkle trees - can reconstruct a merkle proof for any piece of data at any time
        - or just the parts they care about + merkle proofs for each part to link them to a block
            - for multiple pieces of data can be optimized with merkle pollards and/or (sparse) multiproofs
    - if the state doesn't keep historical mapping of block numbers & identities to IPFS hashes:
        - there needs to be a merkle proof within the block
- merkle proofs linking identities to authorized services or keypairs at a specific block height




if the history of key rotations & revocations is not guaranteed, then data cannot be self-authenticating

events must be self-authenticating - and not requiring that the source (original creator) be always around to provide proofs for their authenticity.





- Graph with the proofs for a URI



TODO cache the merkle root & IPFS CID from blocks in the state?

    - Update/delete account info/handle
    - Merkle root of all new content generated by the application
- Root hash of the state (connections, applications & accounts)



# What is in a block

- account actions
    - token transfers
    - IDM-like:
        - create new accounts without a keypair
        - binding & updating keypairs (changes require signature from the previous key)
        - list of application authorizations & revocations for accounts that it controls (each of which is just an integer pair - `56 => 661`)
    - Application-like:
        - content blob Merkle root
        - content blob IPFS CID
        - list of follow/unfollow actions for accounts (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
        - Application-related info updates
            - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
            - keypair updates


- IDM batches
    - list of application authorizations & revocations (integers pairs - `56 => 661`)
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - keypair binding & changes (changes require signature from the previous key)
    - IDM-related info updates
- Application batches
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - content Merkle root
    - content blob IPFS CID 
    - Application-related info updates
        - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
        - keypair updates
- State root - the Merkle root for the latest materialized state

In reality a single account may play [all 3 roles](identity.md) - normal user, IDM & Application, so end users may even authorize applications & post content themselves as long as they have a keypair & the funds to pay for their direct on-chain transactions. The distinction here is to help paint the picture.

# Materialized state

For Headjack the state throughout history is much more important when compared to financial applications because there will be much more queries to prove things in the past (again and again) compared to just the present. Also, because 


TODO: does the state actually need to contain the historical mapping? not necessarily as third-party services could be doing that, but forcing full nodes to do it properly in the state & maintaining consensus would simplify the architecture of the rest


TODO: need examples & specifics for how big URI proofs would be




An account has the following properties:
- `ID` (`integer`) - unique on the blockchain, autoincrement, starting from 1
- `sig` - cryptographic address & signature
    - can be null ONLY if an `acm_id` is present
- `acm_id` (`integer`) - ACM ID - which [ACM](acm.md) can grant access to [applications](applications.md)
    - can be null ONLY if a `sig` is present

Other less important fields:

- `block_created` (`integer`) - in which block was the account first created

<h1 id="how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction"><a class="header" href="#how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction">How big is a Headjack transaction</a></h1>
<p>Applications post anchors to off-chain content with an IPFS CID hash and a merkle root. IDMs also anchor off-chain content (mainly user preferences &amp; updates to social graph), but they also post authorizations to other accounts (applications) to post on behalf of users as integer pairs.</p>
<p>So the fields for a transaction by an application/IDM (which will be the majority) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>version: <code>4 bytes</code></li>
<li>signature: <a href="https://ethvigil.com/docs/eth_sign_example_code/#recovering-the-message-signer-in-the-smart-contract"><code>65 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob IPFS address: <a href="https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid/01"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob merkle root: <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/merkle-tree-merkle-root-explained/"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>nonce: <code>4 bytes</code> auto-increment integer associated with the account - to prevent reordering of anchored off-chain blobs (which would mess up internal addressing based on that nonce)</li>
<li>value: <code>4 bytes</code> amount of native token paid to validators for transaction inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>So far that is <code>141 bytes</code> which almost every transaction by an application or IDM contains. IDMs also submit a list of authorizations (or revocations) as integer pairs. For example, 1000 accounts authorizing 15 different applications to post on their behalf would be 1000 integer pairs. Assuming 8 byte integers (up to 2^64) that would be 8 * 2 * 1000 = 16k bytes.</p>
<h1 id="naive-scenario"><a class="header" href="#naive-scenario">Naive scenario</a></h1>
<p>The initial version will target block bandwidth of up to 100 kb/s. This is not a problem for <a href="https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1546911451125649408">validium ZK rollups</a> as there are already DA solutions that offer <a href="https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1517137629334056960">10 mb/s or even much more</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 MB block size &amp; 10 second block time (100 kb/s of block bandwidth)</li>
<li>1000 applications posting in every block</li>
<li>100 IDMs authorizing as much users as possible - filling the remaining block space</li>
<li>no on-chain actions such as keypair &amp; name changes, account creation &amp; direct interaction with the chain by end users</li>
</ul>
<p>We get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1100 actors (1000 applications + 100 IDMs) that post in every block at least <code>141</code> bytes for their transactions, which is <code>155100</code> bytes</li>
<li>the remaining <code>893476</code> bytes (1048576 (1MB) - 155100) can be filled with authorizations and since an authorization is <code>16</code> bytes (8 * 2) that would be 55842 authorizations/revocations every 10 seconds or 5584 authorizations/revocations per second</li>
<li>for 1 billion accounts that would be 0.557 authorizations/revocations per person per day which is actually quite good - people on average do way less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-ons</a> per day</li>

<h1 id="realistic-scenario"><a class="header" href="#realistic-scenario">Realistic scenario</a></h1>
<p>The naive scenario does not include on-chain actions for specific accounts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>keypair changes (new pubkey (32 bytes) + signature (65 bytes) if there is an older key)</li>
<li>account creation (if done by an IDM then this is just a few bytes - no pubkey)</li>
<li>name registration &amp; ownership changes (see the <a href="handles.html">dedicated page</a> for more details)</li>
<li>updating account fields such as a URI pointing towards an off-chain account directory (which could point to archived posts) or pointing to another account index for such services</li>
<li>signed transactions by individual accounts that want to directly interact with the chain
<ul>
<li>authorizing an IDM, rotating keys, or even publishing off-chain content as an application</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the realistic scenario will not be far from the naive because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a % of all accounts will have keypairs (even though 100% could) and will make just a few signed actions per year - leaving most block throughput for authorizations through IDMs.</li>
<li>Large % of accounts will rarely even be authorizing new applications - many people don't sign in to new services through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> every single day. There could also be 2 types of log-ins: passive (viewing only - nothing on-chain) and authorized (allowing services to post on behalf of users).</li>
<li>Many applications that don't generate a lot of off-chain activity will publish less often than on every block in order to minimize on-chain block space costs.</li>
<li>The chain throughput can be further optimized &amp; scaled by multiple orders of magnitude.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="optimizations--scaling"><a class="header" href="#optimizations--scaling">Optimizations &amp; scaling</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Throughput of 100 kb/s is just the start &amp; can easily go to 1-10 mb/s as a ZK rollup.</li>

<li>Integer indexes that only need 4 bytes can be compressed/batched together - it'll take many years to go beyond 4 billion accounts so the actual throughput is <strong>2x</strong> of what is listed here.</li>
<li>A fee market can develop that tunes the cost of different actions so that actors don't just pay for on-chain bytes - the ways the system is used can be guided through incentives.</li>

<p>TODO: should IPFS hashes &amp; merkle roots be saved in the state?
- no?</p>
<img src="images/account_name_state.png">
<!-- 

The growth of the chain and the state will differ by a few things:


One difference between Headjack and financial blockchains is that they don't force historical records into the state whereas that is the main value proposition of Headjack.



This is a solution that is provably possible and better and can only get better in time with further innovation and scaling


The goal is to avoid congestion and provide enough bandwidth in a predictable way for web scale



This could be a concern when Headjack takes over the world - if blocks are 10 mb once every 10 seconds the chain would grow by 86 gb/day. However, 

The processing of the state machine is minimal - orders of magnitude less complexity & compute compared to generalized smart contract platforms

The state growth will be slower than the blockchain growth because:

- an on-chain authorization is a pair of integers while only 1 integer goes into the state


goal: no congestion


a tiny core on which we have consensus can be used to cryptographically anchor & link unlimited amounts of data - the entire web - a few terabytes (tiny is relative - compared to the data) of materialized blockchain state including the absolute bare minimum of historic.

- state doesn't need to store the merkle roots & IPFS hashes - merkle proofs can contain block numbers & block hashes -->
<p>TODO: light clients? in addition to merkle proofs for inclusion of content they would need merkle proofs for the state of which applications a user has authorized to post on their behalf in a given block</p>

<p>There are no limits for off-chain content as it is all just anchored with merkle roots - it could be as high as hundreds of terabytes per second.

<!-- validium

This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (`"X follows Y"` only affects `X`) and that is [provable with easy to grasp napkin math](numbers.md).

data availability guarantees don't need to be as strong as for finance - it won't be fatal to revert a few blocks of activity if data is unavailable -->

Misinformation is a plague in videos without context

the health of reporting on the web through video is appaling - decentralization and democratization are powerful but without the means to interleave everything into a shared ledger of record and actually have some accountability it all becomes an informational mess. But YouTube doesn't optimize for that - not at all.

<p>Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages &amp; trade secrets.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<ul>
<li>lack of cooperation, interoperability, duplicated effort &amp; stifled innovation</li>
<li>competition for scarce talent which leads to sub-par solutions</li>
<li>company bloat &amp; inefficiencies
<ul>
<li>companies are harder to manage as they are way bigger than what they could be</li>
<li>bigger size demands higher revenue - pricing out many business models</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>differences in functionality between platforms =&gt; complexity for users</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrast that to open protocols &amp; exportable data where anyone can specialize, innovate &amp; provide the best possible service for a specific vertical &amp; sell it to others. The move from <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">host to data-centric</a> addressing and open blockchains enable <a href="https://balajis.com/yes-you-may-need-a-blockchain/">interoperability</a> and composability.</p>

<p>Google is way more than just a search engine even though the majority of their revenue comes from advertising - they control large percentages of the plumbing of the web - key choke points such as submarine cables, routing, data centers, browsers, DNS, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidVorick"><code>David Vorick</code></a> puts this perfectly into perspective in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486"><code>The Worrying Depth and Scope of Censorship on the Internet</code></a> - some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.&quot;</p>

<li>No clear rules for moderation &amp; censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
<ul>
<li>account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like <a href="https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/">shadow banning</a></li>
<li>accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no way for users to &quot;fork&quot; a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.</li>
<li>There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter &amp; YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal <a href="problems_with_the_web.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertically integrated</a> teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner.

<li>subscriptions are by now almost meaningless without the notification bell icon</li>

<li>the presentation is extremely basic &amp; limiting</li>
<li>you cannot even link to a specific comment with a URL</li>
<li>financial scams in comments are abundant - moderation is non-existent</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Twitter:
<ul>
<li>we can't even sort the tweets of someone based on engagement</li>
<li>we pin threads of threads on our profiles and sequence them with X/YY numbers</li>
<li>cannot sort quotes/replies of a tweet based on engagement/age</li>
<li>no unrolled thread view option even though it's a no-brainer at this point</li>
<li>filtering &amp; tuning what is shown in lists is nonexistent

<!-- tweets & comments without tagging is primitive and inefficient -->

For updates there would be a second list and in order to check the validity for an attestation after an update has been recorded for its nonce, users would need to fetch the off-chain anchored message corresponding to the update at the block at which it was flagged.

<p>We don't need oracles, tokens, automatic on-chain settlement &amp; markets through smart contracts to build reputation systems for predictions &amp; promises - all we need is to immutably sequence predictive messages that are authentically linked to identity and plot the results - the open nature of the data would disincentivize platforms to display it incorrectly which is enough - we trust block explorers after all.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/">Tipranks</a> platform as an example - we can generalize it for anyone in the world - not just for certified financial advisors. The reality is that millions of people are effectively guilty of shilling, despite some preficing it with the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1552968186605490176"><code>&quot;this is not financial advice&quot;</code></a>. We can self-regulate the crypto &amp; financial industries bottom-up in a decentralized way - steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>come up with the base set of extensible prediction message types</li>
<li>build the tools that plot predictions versus a price feed</li>
<li>demand that influencers use the specific types of messages for predictions</li>
<li>refuse to listen to accounts that don't use that format and build the habit to check track records before listening to someone - this can (and will) become a social norm</li>
<li>let the <a href="https://twitter.com/TSLAgang/status/1433896307702353921">chips fall where they may</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have &quot;fallback&quot; translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don't support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema <code>42</code> can have the following template for serialization: <code>&quot;{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}&quot;</code>, and thus a basic application that encounters <code>{message_type: &quot;42&quot;, asset: &quot;$BTC&quot;, date: &quot;2025.02.12&quot;, above_or_below: &quot;above&quot;, price: &quot;100000$&quot;, probability: &quot;80%&quot;}</code> could render <code>&quot;$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12&quot;</code>. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there's no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.</p>
<p>The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.</p>
<!-- Perhaps the reputation system can be abused - by making 100 accounts and building different prediction timelines throughout time and then using only the winners - this page should be treated just as a starting point and isn't trying to provide all the answers. -->

<p>The public conversation shouldn't be fractured between platforms such as Twitter, YouTube &amp; Reddit - instead it should be one but viewed through different lenses (based on moderation / indexing / visualization). The Twitter view of a discussion is basically the same as just the top level comments (without the children) in a Reddit thread. Segregated discussion in the open web serves nobody - there should be canonical IDs for events &amp; information that we can all refer to. It doesn't make sense that comments can be arbitrarily disabled for some document on one platform (YouTube) but enabled on another one where a URL from the first is shared. All content could be interlinked, deduplicated, referencable, quotable, commentable &amp; shareable.</p>

<p>In an open data environment anything could become an event stream as long as someone is willing to pay for the processing costs (filtration, transformation, storage):</p>
<ul>
<li>edits to a specific document identified by a URI</li>
<li>references/mentions of an account/entity/word/URI in public documents</li>
<li>any other type of filtration criteria - thresholds, exclude lists, etc.</li>
<li>complicated streams can be constructed by transforming/joining others - similar to Kafka</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone implements speech-to-text and starts transcribing audio episodes and publishing the output it would immediately become available to anyone and would automatically end up being parsed, indexed &amp; pushed through data pipelines. Composability. This is not possible with closed platforms - even if someone was willing to pay the processing costs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>When identity is decoupled from the presentation layer we could have IDMs that align with our needs - we could fine-tune how and when we want to be notified. The incentive for an IDM is not to suck all of our attention (as opposed to applications that usually serve ads) - there are other ways to monetize. We'd be able to set a threshold or filter on anything. Subscriptions can be granular &amp; multi-dimensional for any type of event stream - like <code>&quot;show me everything from X unless from application A or message type T&quot;</code>. Some IDMs could even offer the feature to show notifications only in specific time ranges of the day - for those addicted to dopamine hits.</p>
<h1 id="bookmarks--playlists"><a class="header" href="#bookmarks--playlists">Bookmarks &amp; playlists</a></h1>
<p>Universal bookmarks - they can have a single repository (your IDM) and work for any type of document from any application. They will be persistent and you could even cache the actual contents that a URI points to along with proofs - in case no one hosts it in the future.</p>
<p>Your personal knowledge base could be built with something like <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> with URI references to external documents that can be locally cached. Looking up the discussion/commentary for a resource with a URI would be just 1 click away.</p>
<p>Playlists are lists of bookmarks and could work even with heterogeneous audio/video providers which anchor the tracks and provide URIs for them. Spotify could be just an application that uses your IDM for account storage and is paying to other media hosting providers for the streaming.</p>
<h1 id="intra-document-addressing"><a class="header" href="#intra-document-addressing">Intra-document addressing</a></h1>
<p>In Medium you can tweet a selection (sentence/word/paragraph) but when going back to the article from the tweet you don't get shown the original selection. With some archival services you can point to a text selection - for example <a href="https://archive.ph/O2D45#selection-635.4-635.18">this link has <code>&quot;Prussian Model&quot;</code></a> selected from the title when you open the page (<code>#selection-635.4-635.18</code>) and you can change the selection which also changes the URL, but that's possible only because there's a specific hash in the URL (<code>O2D45</code>) and the document is guaranteed not to change in the archive - however that's not the case with Medium where the authenticity of documents is host-certified and they can change in time.</p>
<p>With Headjack URIs point to a specific version of a document and as explained in the <a href="names_and_paths.html#addressing-within-content">addressing chapter</a> we could point to parts of documents in the URIs. If a document has been changed, updates will have their own new URIs and when an application is showing an old URI with intra-document addressing it could:</p>
<ul>
<li>either show a label that there's a newer version of the document and the user can switch</li>
<li>or directly show the new version if it's possible to transfer the selection without conflicts</li>
</ul>
<p>Headjack's intra-document addressing is universal - it works for audio &amp; video too and the application from the <a href="startup_case_study.html">startup case study</a> could display this clip with this quote in a much better way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The internet creates 1 giant aggregator for everything&quot; - <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxphJhihcVY-U-PLFEvDl1m7Rb-iq4CGgo">@naval</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be pushed further - any composition/remix/meme of media could contain the references to the original text/pictures/audio/video so the sources of something can be traced and credited - imagine something like a movie maker that composes from other clips and all metadata is retained.</p>
<h1 id="code-as-addressable-data"><a class="header" href="#code-as-addressable-data">Code as addressable data</a></h1>
<p>Frontend code served by applications can be published and have its own URI. Updates to it would happen by broadcasting the next version along with a new URI and then pointing on-chain to it as the latest to use for viewing media. This way presentation layers could be cached locally and in a distributed way with proofs for authenticity - improving redundancy, latency, and throughput. Checking for a newer version would be a small query to the chain if there is a new URI - version control for frontends. This can work even for more dynamic applications that serve different versions depending on region/locale or which are A/B testing - the dynamic part could be served from a centralized host while smaller chunks of code could be referenced through URIs.</p>
<h1 id="the-global-git"><a class="header" href="#the-global-git">The global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a></a></h1>
<p>Headjack is a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control system</a> with different data availability tradeoffs - storage and retrievability are not guaranteed. If someone processes everything that's linked to the blockchain they'd be able to track the creation and changes of each document - both the edits from the original authors and the forks &amp; references from others, and also the sequence of authorizations that update who has authority to edit a document. All events are cryptographically sealed in time with on-chain commitments and the history cannot be tampered with.</p>
<p>We should be able to view the changes of any document with a diff view - similarly to what <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/">The Internet Archive provides</a> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches">this as an example</a>) but with a lot more control and a wide range of different visualization tools - example: a slider for filtering/jumping through time <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096">like in Discourse</a>.</p>

<h1 id="feeds--home-pages"><a class="header" href="#feeds--home-pages">Feeds &amp; home pages</a></h1>
<p>We have no control over what social media shows us - we're presented with their best attempt at engaging us and nothing more. Feeds are primitive/limited and have their own agenda. Once access to data has been democratized we could finally have a choice as new entrants will differentiate themselves in ways that weren't possible before. What if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you want <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1442863553497554944">the first thing you see to be a dashboard</a> with graphs &amp; charts about the things you care about instead of an endless feed to scroll?</li>
<li>instead of a feed you were shown a map with events grouped by category/people/activity so you could choose selectively which zones to &quot;zoom&quot; into based on your interest?</li>
<li>you're interested in all events from the past week - not just those from the last 24 hours?</li>
<li>you want things sorted differently, or to tune out certain kinds of content?</li>
<li>you want your video feed to show content that people you follow have engaged with?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="signaling-preferences"><a class="header" href="#signaling-preferences">Signaling preferences</a></h1>
<p>Events coming from an application are an advertisement for it because the URIs point to it as the source - users are effectively signaling what UI, filtration &amp; content moderation they prefer.</p>
<p>But this can be pushed a lot further - using public <a href="messages.html">message types</a> more specific preferences within one application (and compatible with others) could be signaled. The choice of recommendation algorithms, filtration criteria &amp; moderation levels could be displayed in account profiles throughout all applications either as badges or in some other way. An application could accommodate a wide range of preferences by using different indexes &amp; models which would be handled by infrastructure layers beneath them - reusable by all other applications that need them too.</p>
<p>This way of signaling fine-grained preferences could allow us to collectively migrate to better algorithms - by showing which interests &amp; perspectives we've adopted ourselves. One value to signal would be to use algorithms &amp; models that are transparent and not some <a href="problems_with_the_web.html#black-boxes--algorithmic-bias">black box</a> - we could study how virality happens. What if some algorithm promotes <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1561032192947458048">antisocial ultra viral content</a> close to the borderline of acceptability just for the sake of engagement? We could boycott it. And why not choose indexes &amp; algorithms that up &amp; down regulate specific accounts? Moderation could be done through a set of filters to which users opt in/out by toggling &amp; layering - choosing what to amplify and what to tone down. Such preferences can also be private.</p>
<!-- what if we could punish accounts that comment irrelevant things at famous people first just to get engagement? Have you seen the comments on any of Elon Musk's tweets? Engagement seeking irrelevant garbage -->
<p>Currently social media skews our perception of the world because the vocal become viral - most people are quiet and rarely (if ever) post anything, but they do consume. We could let them signal their preferences and better gauge our values. <strong>Preferences are a form of expression.</strong></p>
<h1 id="aggregate-sentiment---the-big-picture"><a class="header" href="#aggregate-sentiment---the-big-picture">Aggregate sentiment - the big picture</a></h1>
<p>The aggregate sentiment on Twitter’s backend is analogous to a liquidity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book">order book</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%93ask_spread">spread</a> being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">Overton window</a> - we could have a completely different understanding of society, history, and politics and have a societal mirror if not for the current information asymmetry that Big Tech has (point taken <a href="https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=883">from here</a>). Furthermore, we cannot see the &quot;border&quot; between Twitter and Facebook in terms of users - even they (the companies) cannot because the data &amp; backends are private (point taken <a href="https://youtu.be/FV5SqIm5e90?t=4631">from here</a>).</p>
<p>With open data, systems could show the overlap of communities and focus on what's shared and unites them - bridging the gap, making “the others” less foreign, and reducing polarization. We should be taking notes from Taiwan's civic hacktivism and their <a href="https://compdemocracy.org/">Computational Democracy Project</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G0v">G0v movement</a> - building better tools for social consensus &amp; relaxing the culture war. Everything could be visualized through dashboards &amp; graphs - including global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map">heat maps</a> of interests &amp; activity based on topic/region/etc. Learning from history &amp; making analogies could be <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1557247912874086400">much more quantifiable and precise</a> if everything was in the ledger of record. We could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVEP0zAK-xQ&amp;t=3952s">leverage AI</a> to surface human collective intelligence at scale in a transparent way.</p>

<p>Freedom can be a competitive advantage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> lets you leave &amp; take your subscribers with you (an email list) - a conscious choice to compete on the quality of service. <strong>But they are an outlier</strong>.</p>
<p>Headjack's fundamental premise is that it unlocks many possibilities &amp; value to users because the barrier to entry for services would be much lower and they could be composable &amp; interoperable which would lead to greater innovation, quality, choice &amp; freedom. So given that users would benefit more in this ecosystem and that their attention is finite &amp; will be spent either way - it stands to reason that there is money to be made in an even bigger pie! But competition will look different.</p>

<p>The rule book will be different - instead of <a href="problems_with_the_web.html#vertical-integration-vs-market--competition">vertically integrated</a> services with tons of employees that reinvent the wheel, companies would specialize and compete on different layers of the stack. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">Markets Are Eating The World</a> - there will be one for each of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage &amp; retrieval of historical events, data &amp; results of batch processes.</li>
<li>Indexing at scale and even custom indexing by specific criteria.</li>
<li>Training of AI models for recommendation systems, feeds, etc.</li>
<li>Ad serving engines that match users with ones that would be relevant to them.</li>
<li>Computed views (aggregate metrics) such as counts of likes &amp; other interactions.</li>
<li>Content moderation &amp; safety labelers (malware/copyright/offensive/spam) producing lists with flagged accounts, specific pieces of content or even entire applications.
<ul>
<li>Their output could be used not just for the final presentation layer but also before indexes, models &amp; computed views are created as they could be gamed with spam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom types of <a href="possibilities.html#event-streams">data streams</a>, <a href="possibilities.html#notifications--subscriptions">event subscriptions</a>, and anything else one could think of!</li>

<p>Creating a new social application would require just a bit of frontend code by a few developers with all the heavy lifting of infrastructure, data storage &amp; processing, content moderation, ad serving &amp; recommendation engines being provided by pay-as-you-go services through APIs. The (<a href="https://mattturck.com/the-power-of-data-network-effects/">data</a>) network effects will be shared by every actor in the ecosystem. Launching a proof of concept would be trivial and new business models &amp; use cases (no ads for social) would be enabled.</p>

<p>It will take some time for markets to mature and the dust to settle once specialization &amp; competition are democratized, but then prices will be low and the efficiency &amp; quality of services high.</p>
<h1 id="attribution"><a class="header" href="#attribution">Attribution</a></h1>
<p>The goal is democratized access, competition &amp; innovation  - not the end of the Ad model which is a pipe dream - it isn't going anywhere. The current problem is that we don't have alternatives and that there's no transparency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For as long as humans have crafted disembodied versions of their voices, whether it be Pompeiian graffiti or the latest tweet, there have been attempts to both guide user attention in some remunerative direction, and measure the effectiveness of that attention-gathering.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/everything-is-an-ad-network">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Internet monetization is somewhat like a Soviet election: It doesn’t matter who clicks and where, it’s who counts those clicks that matters. The technology and business of that counting of clicks (and everything else you do online besides) goes by the dull-sounding name of attribution, and it determines the fate of trillion-dollar companies.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's examine the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A recent example of questionable attribution: I tweeted about my e-mountain bike, Jason Calacanis (of all people) saw it and asked about the model. Someone posted a review from bikeradar.com, and Jason (I don’t know if this is true) probably googled for it and maybe bought it. Who deserves the attributions credit? According to Google (surprise, surprise), it’ll be Google … and they’ll take all the credit, which is why Google is worth so much and Twitter so little.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entire flow could be tracked </p>
<p>Furthermore, attribution services could credit accounts that retweet content and add more interactions with it with some of the profits</p>
<p>de-duplication through content addressing &amp; adding traceability of content helps paint the picture what happened when and by who - aiding attribution. Infrastructure companies on which applications get deployed on can handle such tracking within them but since all the data is openly broadcasted competing services could offer alternative business models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whether it be circulation numbers for 19th-century newspapers (the start of the printed ads business), or Nielsen ratings for pre-cable TV that determined ads rates there, there’s never been a media ecosystem that didn’t have attribution.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you had to conjure some collective mechanism for storing aggregated data that was selectively shareable between publisher and advertiser, it would look much like a blockchain.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>^^ this can be done through verifiable computation &amp; sharing indexes between publishers &amp; advertisers within index infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">This article</a> posits that attribution has to go on-chain but Headjack offers an alternative - through the infrastructure companies.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that mass media &amp; aggregation will be handled by centralized services that can save user details in logs - what we could do is make a market for user data and make it easier to opt out of such data harvesting with alternatives &amp; a way for whistleblowers to prove if a contract hasn't been honoured.</p>
<p>the history of actions and tracked events would be private and shared only between infra platforms and ppl paying for ads?</p>
<p>what if people jump between apps but aren't logged in some of them? chain is broken.</p>
<p>applications could strategically choose which infrastructure companies they use in order to provide the best attribution for accounts</p>

<h1 id="application-attribution"><a class="header" href="#application-attribution">Application attribution</a></h1>
<p>All content is published through applications and the creator's choice for which one to use is forever embedded in the content URIs. This can serve as advertising for applications because even when a URI is viewed through competing ones, the original source should be displayed and there ought to be a way to view it through the original one - especially if the <a href="messages.html">message type</a> is not supported.</p>
<p>This can be a powerful way for new applications to get discovered - they can even pay creators to use them in order to attract new users and have their names in the URIs of content <strong>forever</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="identity-managers---the-new-storage-cloud"><a class="header" href="#identity-managers---the-new-storage-cloud">Identity managers - the new storage cloud</a></h1>
<p><a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> will be the central hub to store all user preferences, social graph, DMs, progress on long-form media, personal notes &amp; bookmarks, etc. But also pictures, videos and many other types of data - the one-stop shop for all things identity. There'll be plenty of ways to provide free tiers and yet monetize for more heavy &amp; advanced use. Anyone will be able to host their own IDM.</p>
<p>IDMs could also provide a <a href="algorithms_feeds_aggregation.html#feeds--home-pages">feed</a> &amp; a home page similar to current social networks with the most &quot;relevant&quot; content for users and even serve ads, but there'll be a lot more configuration options &amp; choice because all IDMs will be in competition with each other &amp; users will be able to migrate.</p>
<h1 id="creator-monetization"><a class="header" href="#creator-monetization">Creator monetization</a></h1>
<p>creators will need to shift how they monetize because there won't be platform lock-in &amp; attribution :/
or actually the application attribution for content naturally leads to users checking it out - creators can and should be paid to generate content through them and based on virality of content they could get paid out? omg.</p>
<h1 id="video-long-form-media--streaming"><a class="header" href="#video-long-form-media--streaming">Video, long-form media &amp; streaming</a></h1>
<p>Let's take YouTube for example: currently it is &amp; does many things at once: storage &amp; streaming of video, a recommendation system, serving ads, social features, subscriptions, etc.</p>
<p>In the brave new world of Headjack it would be completely unbundled</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the video hash uploaded?</li>
<li>embedded player required?</li>
<li>serving ads or just charging apps for the data streams?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if some platforms don't freely provide the content but just anchor it and provide APIs like embedding youtube?</p>
<p>separate content hosting &amp; delivery from the recommendation system and the serving of ads</p>

<h1 id="the-future-of-influencer-marketing"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-influencer-marketing">The future of influencer marketing</a></h1>
<p>Currently, companies cannot target you directly with ads without the social media platforms as middlemen - but with open data, any company could analyze the world and decide what their target audience is.
Currently, Coca-Cola targets audiences with the same ad but with some precision - imagine if they could directly target individuals with tailor-made ads based on them - what if an algorithm picks up that you're gay and coca cola send you an ad with a shirtless male (if you're male) - point taken from Yuval Noah Harari here: https://youtu.be/j0uw7Xc0fLk?t=260</p>
<p>Imagine influencers being able to use algorithms to generate synthetic versions of themselves pitching different products to different people and having the application infrastructure serve different versions to different people based on who they are. The influencer is the magnet and the algorithms are the tailors. This is the future whether we like it or not. The good thing about an unbundled media stack is that some services will let you avoid ads for a subscription fee.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing is the end game</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The metaverse isn’t a 3D world owned by some corporation.

<!-- > "Metaverse doesn’t mean 3D, it means decentralized." - [@naval](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1516477829134704641) -->
<p>The metaverse is about entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing applications &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable. <strong>But how does Headjack fit in it?</strong></p>
<p>We believe the way forward is through a layered stack of technologies &amp; open protocols and that underneath everything sit identity &amp; content addressing as primitives. All experiences &amp; events can &amp; will be interlinked, tied to identity &amp; made easily referencable. Anything can be built &amp; made composable &amp; interoperable on top of these building blocks as long as they don't impose any constraints - no more walled gardens and fractured experiences. Furthermore, the Metaverse is mostly about agency in creation - transaction, exchange &amp; finance are not at the forefront and will be handled by other layers &amp; protocols like public generalized smart contract chains &amp; NFTs.</p>

<p>&quot;The metaverse has nothing to do with “view” modalities — the tools you use to see the metaverse. That’s a convenient meme for those who have control over manufacturing hardware.&quot; - <a href="https://future.com/7-essential-ingredients-of-a-metaverse/">source</a></p>

<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJvFr9v7Nk">older video</a> showcasing this UI (can't resize the window with the mouse yet).</p>
<h1 id="a-unique-interface"><a class="header" href="#a-unique-interface">A unique interface</a></h1>
<p>This is nothing like SoundCloud where <a href="https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/for-fun-prod-by-beatsbyjeff">tiny overlapping rectangles</a> with profile pictures are rendered on the timeline that you can just hover with the cursor to see the comment nor like YouTube where you can write a timestamp (<code>hh:mm:ss</code>) in a comment which becomes a clickable link that fast-forwards the player - fighting it out with the other 20 000 comments in the single linear vertically scrollable section of a 3 hour long podcast and hoping to be noticed - both are horribly insufficient and unusable. For both of them comments are just an afterthought - it is extremely hard to discuss specific parts of long-form media &amp; for good localized signal to actually surface &amp; be noticed.</p>
<h1 id="challenges-in-the-current-web2-world"><a class="header" href="#challenges-in-the-current-web2-world">Challenges in the current web2 world</a></h1>
<p>How would this work as a web2 company?</p>
<ul>
<li>For it to provide value it would need many users commenting on the same video or otherwise there will be no histogram and the whole interface will be pointless. It needs a network effect.</li>
<li>Discoverability is hard - it would require that users actively share links to it on other platforms.</li>
<li>What if YouTube/Spotify cut it off &amp; disallows embedding their players &amp; using the APIs?</li>
<li>Unclear if it should try to be its own platform or just a (browser) plugin to other platforms:
<ul>
<li>The platform way is more ambitious but requires a ton more work &amp; <a href="problems_with_the_web.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertical integration</a>: direct messages, a social graph, notifications, a feed &amp; recommendation systems, etc. Would it need to compete with YouTube &amp; Spotify at some point? The likely <a href="images/startup_failure_outcome.jpg">outcome</a>.</li>
<li>The plugin way is a much more limited experience. How would users share links to comments &amp; timeline ranges to others that don't have the plugin installed? How will users be notified for comments &amp; replies? You'd be completely beholden to the platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation"><a class="header" href="#how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation">How Headjack's paradigm fosters innovation</a></h1>
<p>Contrast that to a web built around Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of work for this UI would be minimal - reusing components already present:
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a>, DMs, notifications, progress bars, preferences &amp; connections will all be handled by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>.</li>
<li>The heavy lifting (processing &amp; indexing all broadcasted events, perhaps moderation &amp; even ad serving) will be handled by infrastructure services which will charge the application just the right amount for the sets of API calls &amp; indexes that it needs - pay-as-you-go. There will be different competing infrastructure providers and applications will be able to migrate to the one with the best service or it may even utilize multiple ones at the same time - offering users the choice which indexes &amp; filters to use.</li>
<li>The costs &amp; team required to implement this UI will be minimal and focus would be on delivering value to users. The barrier to entry would be lower and better UX &amp; functionality would be unlocked - many more niche needs could be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application discoverability - the moment someone with a following posts a comment through it that comment would immediately be visible to their audience on applications like Twitter and the URI for the comment will contain the name of the application that was used for its generation - serving as application attribution &amp; advertisement of the alternative application. No need for influencers to explicitly share <code>&quot;hey! check out this platform where I made a comment and make sure to follow me there&quot;</code> to their audience - it'll be automatic &amp; implicit.</li>
<li>No risk of platforms cutting access to their APIs to third-party apps &amp; changing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service">ToS</a> because in this ecosystem everything is a third-party app around unified identity and data is no longer host-certified - addressing is <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">data-centric</a>. There are no <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp">MOATs</a> &amp; lock-in - everyone focuses on their niche and competes on competency &amp; offering the best possible service.</li>

<p>A list of problems with the contenders in the decentralized identity/media space:</p>
<ul>
<li>No credible path to <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">web-scale</a> - some will hit a wall even at 1 million users. Most are vague around their scalability &amp; data structures and don't put it <a href="numbers.html">front and center</a> - obfuscating the most important bit. Instead of focusing on NFTs &amp; developer APIs, start with the data and work up from that.

<blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<p>Linking online identity to public financial accounts on Ethereum/Solana/etc will have unintended consequences - a bad default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federated ones lack <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logical centralization</a> which leads to fragmentation and <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/9529">no discoverability</a>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Some use chains such as Ethereum for <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logical centralization</a> &amp; store vector commitments (Merkle roots) for events around <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/key-revocation-in-self-certifying-protocols/">key management</a> (rotations, authorizations, sessions &amp; revocations) but the data availability problem for whatever is committed is unsolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>The complexity is not encapsulated - there are many open questions, edge cases &amp; failure scenarios and it would inevitably lead to assumptions &amp; trust.</li>
</ul>
<!-- - Many focus just on the latest keypairs and don't sequence the signed actions throughout time  - much harder to prove that content generated with an older keypair was indeed legitimate at the time of creation and generated back in time instead of fraudulently constructed later on if the keypair is compromised. -->
<ul>
<li>Some anchor to Bitcoin but the time to finality matters a lot for UX - 10-minute block times with probabilistic finality is horrendous.</li>

<p>A specialized blockchain is required. Finance is mostly about specific accounts &amp; energy preservation - no double-spends (example: UTXOs care only about other UTXOs).

!!!!!

With Farcaster, content is directory-certified and cannot be fully self-authenticating because if the directory to which the on-chain account points to goes away - so does the credibility for any piece of data by that account - no way to cache proofs. Furthermore, directories can be tampered with and currently it's up to the p2p network to keep track if any malicious changes happen



farcaster - their model can work even without the p2p nodes - aggregators can be built that talk directly to host directories

farcaster can be built on top of Headjack but not everything that can be built on Headjack can on Farcaster

Farcaster is the best team in the space.

<p>Their architecture: <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol">link</a>. The account registry is on a blockchain and everything else is off-chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registry on Ethereum L1 - for new accounts, name/host changes &amp; key management.</p>
<ul>
<li>No plans on moving to an L2 or their own chain. Also, state rent could eventually be introduced to Ethereum which would lead to further costs &amp; complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keypairs &amp; wallets required - harder mass adoption. Authorizations still <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#45-signer-authorizations">require a signature from the root key</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocations invalidate all prior activity from a delegate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, this means that all messages signed by that signer will be lost since we cannot tell which ones were signed by the attacker.&quot; - <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#71-signer-compromise">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#46-root-signer-revocations">Root signer revocations</a> are even more impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - Cast timestamps are self-reported and can be manipulated - no true cryptographic total ordering - which leads to a lot of complexity in the node software. Not sure what happens to old casts that were signed with obsolete keypairs and how the history of keys is handled. -->
<!-- message ordering, timestamps & authenticity can be manipulated which requires more logic in the software to keep track of previous hashes
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#message-ordering -->
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#5-peering">p2p network</a>'s ability to scale by passing around granular casts is questionable - they are already discussing possible flooding and nodes having to shadow ban and flag accounts based on behavior.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: problem with farcaster - you cannot save content from others forever with authentic proofs if the person removes completely their history of key changes & content signatures. Correct? -->
<!-- Directly polling accounts & their hosts for new events is more scalable but has tradeoffs compared to broadcasting messages & ingesting them into DBs & indexes (pull vs push). -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus is on <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#47-sharding">partial views of the network</a> as opposed to mass scale aggregation &amp; indexing - although that could easily be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/pull/1/files">Cast URIs</a> will look something like <code>farcaster://id:8789213729/cast:0xf00b4r</code> which is less readable than what Headjack will be offering with <a href="addressing.html">its addressing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall good intuition about the concept of <a href="https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks">sufficient decentralization</a> (putting only what is absolutely necessary on a blockchain) but the p2p node implementation takes on too much <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#7-security-considerations">responsibility, complexity &amp; assumptions</a> (consensus, CRDTs, trees, ordering, flooding &amp; replay attacks, etc.) and is lacking in other areas.</p>

<p>One of the few solutions with their <a href="https://www.frequency.xyz/">own chain</a> in the space that makes sense. Their work (the <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">DSNP whitepaper</a>) has had the most influence over Headjack's design but the two have diverged in some key respects - the biggest of which are scalability and content addressability. This idea is too important to leave to a single player without competition.</p>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/project-liberty-launched-with-100-million-from-frank-mccourt">100m$ of funding</a> (so far) from just 1 person - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgPZnOulBCE">Frank McCourt</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good research, good direction, but slow execution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
- Some good ideas in their [DSNP whitepaper](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf) but not nearly enough emphasis on compactness. Too much on-chain & using smart contracts for identities - cannot truly scale. -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keypairs required even for delegated entities (although that can be reworked)
https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identity#delegation
if delegation also happens through keys then they would also have to go into the blockchain state - making it much bigger. In Headjack an authorized application is simply a few on-chain integers kept in the state (block ranges &amp; account IDs) - no need to keep block ranges for delegated keys.
https://forums.projectliberty.io/t/shorts-one-public-key-is-not-enough/215/3
1 key per device? bloat. inefficient.
&quot;Thus, we can only trust one thing: The actor signing this data had access to the private key.&quot;
all data is expected to be signed with a key - suboptimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>broadcast announcements refer to the content with a URL &amp; HTTP - <a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Types/Reply.html#url">host-centric</a>, not in the blob, worse hosting guarantees</p>

<p>big reliance on hashes for announcement addressing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
- They haven't managed to form a real community yet (although it is still early) and haven't moved as fast as others in the crypto industry for the past 2 years since their inception. -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>No names within the project - just integer IDs for accounts. Content addressing URIs are based on hashes and there's no connection to the batch / service that published it which makes indexing harder - <a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identifiers.html#dsnp-content-uri">example</a>. So addressing content is much worse compared to Headjack's <a href="addressing.html">human-readable &amp; persistent URIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a difference: DMs as announcements (&amp; public - leaking metadata) vs IDM-based (direct IDM-IDM comms) &amp; not anchored to the chain &amp; not announced to the world at all (TODO: revisit this)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no hierarchical delegation - keypairs required, every delegation goes on-chain and requires a signature (bulky) - limited throughput.</p>

<!-- 


- how to think about Headjack - analogies, kafka, etc.


- Kafka comparison - whats a stream, what are the guarantees and differences
    - maybe take the event streams part of the "possibilities with open data" page and separate it?
    - 
    - do a table as a comparison
    - 


if everything is just hashes indexing will suffer.


Whatever you think about [Urbit](https://urbit.org/) - even it could be migrated from Ethereum to Headjack for its identity. TODO: is this true? 32 bit integers for ids?


- the hierarchical addressing of content is a natural fit for kafka topics
    - application IDs as topics and offsets as nonces
        - lol - no, there are limits to how many topics there are - better use Cassandra
    - topics per user?
    - still very easy to pipe everything through it as compared to data with hashes
    - this is for infrastructure page!




[open state database](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640)



RSS was [too technical](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008) and it failed - [`"people jumped ship as soon as something better came along"`](https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html).
This is the user friendly revival of RSS



Think of Headjack as an [information bus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf) on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self-describing messages, dynamically definable message types & permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity & authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage & retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain ([IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System)) for which durability & retrievability is on a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) basis without guarantees. It can [scale](numbers.md) practically as much as necessary. Another way to look at it is as a global [publish-subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) messaging network similar to [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway. It is the manifestation of Jack's [vision for decentralizing Twitter](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106) which should have never become a company as [Jack admits](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1562861302242226178).

In a society with faltering institutions, rotted from within and mistrusted from without, the chance to finally replace our banks and internet giants (not to even delve into politics) with a new set of characters is too tempting to resist.

Few tech giants of the past have ever been unseated from their dominance via competition alone: Microsoft never lost the desktop, Google never lost search, Twitter has never lost the public square, Amazon will never lose e-commerce, and Apple will never lose mobile devices. The only way to get out from under those weary giants is creating a new playing field and absolutely dominating it before they figure out what’s going on.

Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol

The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity & interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus

A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case

No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum & is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains

I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.

finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability & retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block & the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...




- ZK rollup?
- eth2 danksharding?
- mina snapp?
- unbounded state growth.



- look into aggregate/multi/threshold signatures, ZK tech & other certificates:

Ethereum uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called Secp256k1.
the address is the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key.

an IDM may also use a social recovery wallet instead of email as login - or just a normal wallet/keypair authorization

the more you rely on IDMs for features and data storage, the less sovereign you are.


If an IDM does not let users bind keypairs then they should be boycotted

IDMs never get access to your private key


query IDMs directly for content by person X - polling mechanics like RSS


Permissions for different actions could be separated - for example requiring signatures for content while not requiring for updating follow connections.

These are [accounts](accounts.md) that can grant the ability to applications to post on behalf of accounts that are under the control of the ACM in question.



Identity managers can still be compromised and wreck havok, but this is an improvement to the status quo
TODO: problem: what happens if an ACM with control of millions of accounts stops behaving properly?
- users without keypairs are screwed
- users with keypairs will be sending on-chain messages but those will be huge and will clog the network
    - possible solution: batch them off-chain into 1000 batches, construct BLS aggregate sigs, sign a msg & transmit that along with a bitmap for which keys participated in the batching to a block.
    Users will need to coordinate off-chain & decide from which block to revoke the access, which other ACM should be approved, etc. This can be used in other scenarios too.

Names must be between 1 and 16 characters and can only be made of letters (a-z), numbers(0-9) and underscores (_).

UTF-8 support for handles opens handle users up to homograph attacks, not to mention case-sensitivity issues. This issue is of ongoing discussion both for the DSNP as well as in for ICANN domain names and other projects working with internationalization support.

**Register** 
Users acquire a name by making two transactions — the first is to commit a secret hash of the username, and the second is to reveal the secret and claim the username to the address. During the reveal phase it also:

commit-reveal scheme prevents frontrunning

- giving/leasing the names properly & orderly is a hard problem

TODO: maybe this should be together with addressing?

backwards-compatibility of the handles - can mimic typical DNS like "twitter.com"

TODO: strategy: reserve all handles that have 1-1 twitter & instagram versions

TODO: think about namespaces & hierarchies like in DNS & also ENS - is ENS a namespace?

Another key differentiator is that Handshake is the first to pre-reserve names for existing trademark name holders.
TODO: DNS & TLS stuff...
Why is Handshake pre-reserving the top tens of thousands of domain names according to Alexa.com?
TODO: maybe also reserve the top 100k twitter handles?

"The other major problem with Handshake auctions is that they are Vickrey auctions."
"Handshake would be a lot better if it had a bidding system that assumed users were unskilled and naive, and attempted to optimize the outcome for users assuming that they made bad or uninformed decisions."
