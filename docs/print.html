<p>Headjack is an <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1123092897664880640">open state database</a> designed for <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">web-scale</a> social media (in the billions of users) that addresses the most fundamental pieces of the puzzle: identity, connections, names and <a href="addressing/addressing.html">content addressability</a> with stable &amp; readable paths resembling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name">URNs</a> (instead of hashes) all packaged in a credibly neutral &amp; self-sustaining blockchain. It is <a href="introduction/ambition.html">aiming</a> to disaggregate the giants and end network effect monopolies &amp; data silos by aligning incentives and striking the right balance of tradeoffs - there will be no mass adoption without retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to.</p>
<p>Web3 is often associated with user ownership of networks/services/data, governance, NFTs &amp; micropayments, and while all of them will play a part in it, the main aspect is the distribution of power around identity and <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162401646258749441">making it sovereign</a> - the metaverse is about connected entities that interact with information under a common global namespace and surf the web through competing interfaces &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="logo.png">
</div>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="on-chain-vs-off-chain"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-vs-off-chain">On-chain vs off-chain</a></h1>
<p>Due to practical limitations it is <a href="introduction/web_scale.html">impossible</a> to put everything on a blockchain so we have to make a key distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity &amp; connections being the most valuable - a clear example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> (basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)">Medium</a> but you own the mailing list for your audience). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking &amp; ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681">essential crown jewel</a> that needs preservation - the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">pub-sub</a>. The data availability (DA - storage &amp; retrievability) for identity &amp; the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.</li>
<li>Content should be stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> and other protocols) because of the sheer volume - it's ephemeral and its relevance fades with time. Most of it doesn't have to be stored forever but any piece can be backed up through third-party archival services. It gets anchored with cryptographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle roots</a> in the main chain so that permissions, inclusion &amp; sequence are provable - that way even if content goes dark it can later resurface and be deduplicated by linking it to its previous instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The game theory behind why competing interfaces (presentation layers) would freely share the activity of their users with others is that if they don't they would be effectively denying reach - users would migrate to a competitor because the cost to do so is 0 - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty_Model"><code>voice and exit</code></a>. Current social media platforms are monopolies because identities are not portable and the network effects are in private database silos - a problem practically insurmountable for incumbents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When identities become portable, backends become liquid&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/coconidodev/status/1504850437727571974">@balajis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="core-idea"><a class="header" href="#core-idea">Core idea</a></h1>
<p>There are 5 guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption &amp; parity on convenience &amp; UX with Web2 services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be scalable to billions of users and that must be <a href="introduction/scaling.html">obvious &amp; provable</a> if devs &amp; entrepreneurs are expected to jump on the opportunity.</li>
<li>Must be simple and familiar - abstracting the complexity away. RSS was <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/311992206716203008">too technical</a> and it failed - <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3mm4z/the-rise-and-demise-of-rss"><code>&quot;people jumped ship as soon as something better came along&quot;</code></a>. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; pass / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize interfaces to post on their behalf. Linking IDs to financial accounts on Ethereum/Solana/etc by default is misguided.</li>
<li>Users shouldn't have to think about and pay for the storage of their data by default - costs should be shifted to services.</li>
<li>Users should be able to own their identity &amp; connections in a sovereign way with a keypair <strong>even if by default</strong> their activity is managed by something resembling a custodial service.</li>
<li>Anyone should be able to have an identity, operate an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> or serve media through an interface.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>There are 3 types of entities in Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>User accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, follow relationships, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing interfaces to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke that authorization).</li>
<li>Interfaces - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All follow relationships &amp; authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space. Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering &amp; exclusion of content based on its type/tag or interface that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.</p>
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/6abnkg.jpg">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; interfaces with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to interfaces using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the interface with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/connections/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to interfaces and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an interface by saying <code>&quot;discard activity from block X forward generated through interface Y&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - in the current Web2 world we've accepted that possibility anyway.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Interfaces will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their activity will need explicit signatures - updating follow connections on-chain will be more costly because they'll take a lot more bytes but the requirement of signatures will not impact the cost of off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly connections) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be light-weight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. Their subscriptions/interests matter most, but at any point in time they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath interfaces.</p>
<hr />
<p>Think of it as an <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2003sp/papers/OPS93.pdf">information bus</a> on top of which any type of distributed system can be architected thanks to the minimal semantics, self describing messages, dynamically definable message types &amp; permissionlessness. The service objects that deal with identity, connections &amp; authorization are on-chain and have guaranteed storage &amp; retrievability whereas all data objects are just cryptographically anchored and stored off-chain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a>) - durability &amp; retrievability is on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees. Another way to look at it is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network similar to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a> where accounts are treated as topics to which anyone can subscribe to - a notification highway. This is a generalization of Jack's <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">vision for decentralizing Twitter</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The internet is the computer but it's missing identity and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">acls</a>&quot; - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25734612">someone</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key &amp; session management (rotation, authorization &amp; revocation) <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/key-revocation-in-self-certifying-protocols/">require</a> ordering that is <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a>. This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (<code>&quot;X follows Y&quot;</code> only affects <code>X</code>) and that is <a href="introduction/scaling.html">provable with easy to grasp napkin math</a>. It is compatible with any type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> - anything could be associated with an integer ID.</p>
<p>TODO: Just publishing vector commitments (Merkle roots) adds a lot more complexity around making the committed data available &amp; retrievable - putting as much as possible on-chain is a simpler model.</p>
<p>A key point is that in Headjack all connections in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph">interest graph</a> are asymmetric and also visible &amp; on-chain as it is geared towards <a href="https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks">public discourse</a> but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - either on-chain (although much more costly &amp; complex) or handled &amp; stored by <a href="introduction/IDM.html">IDMs</a> with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect. Identities will have their own customized landing pages - provided either on-chain or off-chain through an IDM - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree">Linktree</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/">valued at 1.3B$</a> and is just a bandaid for today’s fragmentation of identity on the internet.</p>

<p>People grossly underestimate the size of the web and the type of infrastructure that's required - here are some <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/">google</a> and <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/">other</a> statistics from a <strong>decade</strong> ago. Here is <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/91513-visualizing-minute-internet-2021.html">another fascinating &amp; mind-boggling</a> yet incomplete picture of what was going on within a single minute of 2021. A peek behind what it takes to run Twitter is a good case in point: <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2009/10/13/why-are-facebook-digg-and-twitter-so-hard-to-scale.html">1</a>, <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2016/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-efficiency-and-optimization">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale">4</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2021/processing-billions-of-events-in-real-time-at-twitter-">5</a>. All of this infrastructure is not just about handling enormous amounts of data but also about great UX &amp; responsiveness: <code>&quot;Latency is not an option anymore&quot;</code> - Amazon <a href="https://www.gigaspaces.com/blog/amazon-found-every-100ms-of-latency-cost-them-1-in-sales">found</a> that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales. Google <a href="http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html">found</a> an extra 500ms in search page generation time dropped traffic by 20% - 16 years ago - our irritable nature probably hasn't changed.</p>
<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/68ut9w.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left: 8px;">
<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="introduction/competition.html">most of the attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. We need to be realistic and focus on the essence - Headjack decentralizes only the most important part of monopolies - the identity &amp; interest graphs, and thus leveling the playing field for competition. It accomplishes this by compact graph representation and avoiding the need for keypairs &amp; signatures by default through an on-chain authorization mechanism while maintaining the optionality for anyone to be fully self-sovereign &amp; explicit - acting as a base layer for competing &amp; interoperable services. It also facilitates data-centric addressing of content under a global namespace which further disincentivizes hoarding data in silos. But Web2 isn't going anywhere - <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"><code>&quot;market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization&quot;</code></a> dictate that the best services will be running on huge server racks in data centers with sophisticated caches &amp; batch processing infrastructure behind familiar UX. The difference will be that users will be able to cryptographically prove content and will be able to leave any of these interfaces for better ones if their offering degrades.</p>
<p>Anyone would still be able to run software locally, interact with the ecosystem, and fetch content &amp; interactions from entities they've subscribed to (although quite bandwidth-intensive), but their experience will be extremely limited in that they won't be able to run any sort of query/filtration/feed algorithm at scale nor aggregate the activity of billions of people in real time.</p>

problems: relying on their ceramic pinning service for data persistence, requires explicit key signatures, focus on financial accounts &amp; linking them

My question in their discord: Hello! Your documentation says Long-term data retention is guaranteed through Ceramic’s blockchain anchoring and our custom data pinning service. and I was wondering what would the long-term incentive for the pinning service be, and if the DAO token you'll be launching soon will be tied to the economic incentive for nodes to store the ever-expanding graph?
Also how big do you see the graph getting? My napkin math for Twitter's 400M users and 700 average connections shows that if using simple 4 byte integers as IDs (no pubkeys/signatures/DIDs) would require 1.1TB of data for the most compact version of the graph (each ID would have an array of IDs that it follows) being able to answer queries like who does X follow and for queries like who follows X the data would need to be 2x bigger (another set of arrays). In reality it would be much more because of other metadata, keys, signatures, bigger integers (to support more than 4 billion indexes), database overhead, etc. Thoughts? </p>

&quot;However, a downside I’ve observed in social networks where content is monetized is that user behavior becomes transparently driven by monetary incentives in ways that feel less genuine. This applies to influencer culture on Instagram as well, but cryptocurrency social networks bake it in from the start.&quot;

<p>Hello Varun,</p>
<p>I had a call with Avichal from Electric Capital yesterday because I was pitching him an idea how to decentralize the social graph but at scale, and he mentioned that I should look at Farcaster. There's overlap and </p>
<p>I'm 100% on board with the idea of putting content off-chain</p>
<p>equity - token? normal company?</p>
<p>You mention Solidity &amp; Ethereum addresses - will the registry live there?</p>
<p>Not US timezone - I'm from Europe. But I could move to an American time zone</p>
<p>Why Solidity... Why general-purpose smart contracts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>unique indexes vs handles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integers for users/interfaces/blocks/nonces are important for referencability &amp; indexability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with on-chain delegation &amp; sequencing (the concept of time) users may not need pubkeys for the messages they have signed because those messages will reference interface nonces &amp; blocks so spoofing will still not be possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>host-centric blobs (user-specific) vs interleaved with the oactivity of other users, posted through interfaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>multiple hosts at the same time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will you have a token and how would it accrue value? what is this 1% equity you offer for new hires?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFAIU hosts only deal with storing data, but many different &amp; competing interfaces could be built that utilize the hosts for data storage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>delegation could be implemented in your system as well.
delegation is key!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the Host Directory should go on chain too!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sequencing &amp; anchoring is important !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is the long-term vision of the project - it's own chain?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>isn't this design very poll-heavy? What if there are 1 billion users and each of them generates 2-3 follow events per day?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the plan seems to be that you'd subsidize gas fees on ethereum in the begining</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is a &quot;follow&quot; event part of a &quot;cast&quot; as a signed blob?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how would you guard against spam/sybil attack &amp; people capturing the best handles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the &quot;sufficient decentralization&quot; post &amp; the docs don't make this point, but I think multiple interfaces could be using the same (managed) host.
don't write this - because this is in the docs:
&quot;A host should not be confused with an application which is a higher-order construct that may include a host, client and other services.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>on-chain registry's performance when checking for duplicate names?
not a problem IMHO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smart contracts user for things like &quot;a feature where you can restrict replies to a message to users who own a specific asset&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any way to make it possible for users to not need keypairs and just use plain old email login? Something like OAuth with the ability to later bind a keypair to a user identity if need be? Delegation &amp; access control management?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what I can do</p>
<ul>
<li>presenting, meme lording, writing text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>shouldn't it be called farcast &amp; the users a farcaster?</p>
<ul>
<li>dont send this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>signing every message &amp; action is a PITA - would prohibit true mass adoption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>merklization &amp; anchoring removes the need for the hash chain of casts and sequencing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFAIU any number of different interfaces/frontends could be implemented that could work with your host? So a host is providing access to your data &amp; actions that you have signed, and any number of interfaces (twitter, youtube, medium, reddit) could be using your host to store the data once you generate it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have you thought about the push vs pull design and if it's possible to combine the 2 to provide the best performance &amp; usability for devs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like this poll-heavy design - instead I think all content should be merklized &amp; andvertized on a chain and interfaces should simply process all data by default</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>light clients that can be ran locally by users would benefit from a poll architecture as opposed to mine :|</p>
<ul>
<li>why not merge both and provide both ways of getting data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>My architecture isn't poll-based and has it's own chain that stores the follow graph along with </p>
</li>

<p>farcaster is also compatible with hosts managing your keys</p>

<p>Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

<p>https://eth.wiki/sharding/Sharding-FAQs</p>
<p>You go to rollups with your capital to transact and exchange - with Headjack you wont be able to take your state back with you to L1 because the entirety of headjack is the state</p>
<p>Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol</p>
<p>The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity &amp; interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus</p>
<p>A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case</p>
<p>No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum &amp; is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains</p>
<p>I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.</p>
<p>finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability &amp; retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block &amp; the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...</p>
<p>Finance is about preservation of energy - the double spend problem
And thus scalability there is different from media scalability which is a data problem</p>
<p>Media is about data access and sequence</p>

<li>Twitter: 400M users (220 MAU), average connections: 700</li>
<li>1.1 TB for arrays of arrays with 4 byte integers (the graph)

<li>signature: 65 bytes</li>
<li>index: 4 bytes</li>
<li>blob IPFS address: 32 (46 in base58 encoding)</li>
<li>blob merkle root: 32
==&gt; 147 bytes</li>
<li>connection between 2 indexes: 8 bytes</li>
<li>10k follow/unfollow events = 10000 * 8 = 80000 bytes
==&gt; total: 80000 + 147 = 80133</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: would receipts/logs be necessary in the blocks - like in Ethereum?</p>
<p>with 1MB/s that means: (600 times more than bitcoin)
1048576 / 80133 = 13 interfaces with equal amounts of traffic/activity</p>
<p>1MB/s of blockchain bandwidth means 13 interfaces can update 10k * 13 = 130k follow/unfollow events per second</p>
<p>that is 11 billion per day - with 1B users that means 10 follow/unfollow per person per day</p>
<p>86 GB/day of chain growth</p>
<p>Twitter has 400M users * 700 average connections per user = 280 billion edges
==&gt; divide by 130k ==&gt; 2153846.15 seconds for all edges ==&gt; 600 hours ==&gt; 25 days</p>

<p>TODO: sharding?</p>
<ul>
<li>not being a financial chain eases a lot of things</li>
<li>sharding is trivial - me following you does not credit your account with anything...
<ul>
<li>or maybe it does because of the &quot;who follows me&quot; array...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>trivial sharding - there's no problem such as fracturing liquidity or preventing composability because entities live on different shards - they just point to each other and the bulk of the action takes place off-chain anyway</li>
</ul>
<p>shard id</p>
<p>If handles are permanent to shards then their allocation to shards can be managed in the beacon chain and it can be consulted when following urls to content - so that the shard idx doesnt have to be in the urls</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><p>If interfaces have to stake and leaving the stake has a queue they would have more incentive not to leave - sticky.</p>
<p>Implement a fee-burn mechanism similar to EIP-1559 in Ethereum so that burnt fees will offset new token issuance as the project gains adoption.</p>
<p>Elastic fee model</p>
<p>What if IDMs need to stake?</p>
