<p>Headjack is a blockchain that links sovereign identities to content at <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">web-scale</a>. Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation is fundamentally different from transfers and exchange of value - the design space around trust &amp; data availability for media and identity is different from finance.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
It is not about less or more trust but about better trust.

Headjack is about better trust - not trustlessness

creational - not transactional

# Motto: <s>TRUSTLESS</s> ***BETTER TRUST***

Headjack does sequencing of events.

Breaking apart identity and media allows for better incentives

it does not deal with storage and neither with routing - any kind of routing can be implemented on top of it with the advantage of addressing content in bulk or by source (publisher or creator)

 -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">UNIX philosophy</a> - in Headjack identity is simply an identifier (unique number) and anything orthogonal (KYC, profiles, privacy, finance) can be layered on top of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It solves single sign-on and allows for user experience similar to Web2 through <a href="identity.html">hierarchical authorization management</a> - keypairs are not required by default and even those with keys bound to their accounts may choose to not explicitly sign every interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consensus is reached on the absolute bare minimum - the history of authorizations, names, keys &amp; off-chain content anchors (merkle roots) - the simplest mental model for developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headjack can support <strong>billions</strong> of accounts and link <strong>unlimited</strong> amounts of off-chain activity to them. The <a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">entire web</a> can be rebuilt on top of it - a claim that is <a href="numbers.html">easily provable</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="addressing.html">Content addressing</a> is with persistent &amp; human-readable URIs (instead of hashes) - the link between identity and data is cryptographically provable even if keys &amp; names have changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn't deal with off-chain data storage and retrievability - those are separate problems and Headjack simply lets entities point to ways for others to retrieve addressable content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - The move from the current [host-centric](host_centric.md#the-host-centric-web--its-decay) web towards [data-centric](host_vs_data_centric.md) addressing represents a paradigm shift around data ownership & access - an architectural reset of the internet. -->

<h1 id="design---guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#design---guiding-principles">Design - guiding principles</a></h1>
<p>These are the guiding principles when aiming for mass adoption of Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="principles.html#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#web-scale-blockspace--the-unix-philosophy">Web-scale, blockspace &amp; the UNIX philosophy</a></li>
<li><a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">Decentralization, neutrality &amp; sovereignty</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux"><a class="header" href="#customer-obsession--the-best-possible-ux">Customer obsession &amp; the best possible UX</a></h1>
<p>It is highly improbable that the masses (and even most crypto natives) would tolerate services that are much worse (slow, limited &amp; cumbersome) and <a href="competition.html">most of the competing attempts for decentralizing media</a> are nowhere close. There are a few aspects to retaining the comforts and UX of Web2 that we've become so accustomed to:</p>
<img src="images/meme_make_them_learn.png" align="right" style="margin-left: 8px; width: 35%">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody wants to deal with keys, wallets &amp; self-custody because of all the headaches &amp; complexities that come along with that. Creation &amp; media are different from exchange &amp; finance and it's OK to trust by default as long as there's <a href="principles.html#decentralization-neutrality--sovereignty">a fallback</a>. We should be aiming for <strong>better trust</strong> instead of trustlessness at the cost of UX. Users shouldn't have to manage keypairs on multiple devices &amp; explicitly sign every interaction - by default they'll be logging into identity managers (<a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>) using email &amp; passwords or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) and would then be using these IDMs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> to authorize applications to post on their behalf without requiring keys &amp; signatures - by delegating trust. This way the majority of Web2 identity &amp; authentication plumbing can be reused with Headjack underneath as just another backend. <code>&quot;Sign-in with Ethereum&quot;</code> doesn't scale - we should aim for familiarity.</p>

<p>Headjack follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">UNIX philosophy</a> - it focuses only on <a href="identity.html">identity</a> (identifiers represented as numbers &amp; name ownership) &amp; linking data/actions to it without trying to do anything orthogonal (data storage, KYC, profiles, privacy, finance, etc.) that can be layered on top.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="identity--authorization"><a class="header" href="#identity--authorization">Identity &amp; authorization</a></h1>
<p>There are 3 types of roles in Headjack (although a single entity may play all 3):</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal accounts - represented by an integer ID on-chain - keypair association is optional.</li>
<li><a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - can manage other accounts by submitting changes for them (name handle, updating keypairs) &amp; acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - authorizing applications to post on behalf of users (&amp; ability to revoke the authorization). They will also be responsible for handling DMs as discussed <a href="IDM.html#dms">here</a>.</li>
<li>Applications - a superset of normal accounts - required to have a keypair - they are the media presentation layer. Users can authorize them through the use of an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> to post on their behalf without having to explicitly sign every interaction (follow, post, comment, react).</li>
</ul>
<p>All authorizations are represented &amp; submitted on-chain as simple integer pairs (<code>2131 =&gt; 83253, 6331 =&gt; 14415</code>) that get aggregated in compact blobs &amp; signed in bulk by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - achieving a very high signal-to-noise ratio (few signatures) ==&gt; improving the throughput in the valuable block space.</p>
<img src="images/sequenced_integer_relations.png">
<p>With this foundation we achieve the following range of usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs for using the blockchain can be shifted to <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; applications with business models to support that - users won't care that there's an underlying token (they'll always be able to interact with it directly through the mempool &amp; pay for transactions if they wish).</li>
<li>Users won't need wallets &amp; keypairs - risky and cumbersome with multiple devices. Most will create accounts through <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> &amp; use email/pass or Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> (<code>&quot;login with Google&quot;</code>) which will create on-chain integer IDs for them without associated keypairs - &quot;owned&quot; by the custodian. Users will be able to &quot;log in&quot; to applications using their IDM as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> for Headjack which will authorize the application with a few bytes on-chain to post actions on behalf of users - all without requiring a single signature by the user - neither on-chain for the identity/authorizations (tiny bits of data - just integers &amp; bit flags submitted by the <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) nor for their off-chain content (posts, comments, reactions).</li>
<li>Users can revoke permissions to applications and even retroactively invalidate activity generated on their behalf by an application by saying <code>&quot;discard activity generated through application А from block X forward&quot;</code> through a small on-chain message published by their IDM because everything is sequenced. This is acceptable because in this blockchain <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1530268923848839173">such data is non-financial</a> and fake activity has smaller consequences - it is still an enormous improvement compared to the current Web2 status quo.</li>
<li>At any point in time users can regain full sovereignty over their identities by binding a keypair through their <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>. Then they'll be able to cut that IDM off (revoke access) &amp; even retroactively invalidate actions from it through another IDM or direct on-chain transactions.</li>
<li>Users can be completely anonymous by directly creating an identity with a keypair &amp; paying for an on-chain transaction. They'll be able to use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> without having to sign with email/pass or a Web2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> - not revealing anything.</li>
<li>Applications will be usable by users that don't use an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a> but all their off-chain activity (posts, comments, reactions) will need explicit signatures.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/authorizations.png">
<p>So at the core of it all is just sequencing relations between integers &amp; Merkle roots for content.</p>
<img src="images/meme_integers_and_relations.jpg">
<p>In practice, we expect that only cypherpunks &amp; people that have something to lose (big audience/reputation) will go through the trouble to manage a keypair. Almost everyone will use <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> - even most crypto natives don't want to explicitly sign every action and have their keys in hot wallets ready to get hacked. This way 99.9% of the user activity on-chain (mostly authorizations) ends up going through authorized services and gets batched in a compact way - requiring only that the service signs the aggregated payload and thus reducing the amount of signatures on-chain.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users will be lightweight: consumers &amp; curators of content (through interactions &amp; reactions) with very little creation on their part and little to no audience. At any point in time, they could shift to a more vocal role and start caring about archiving their off-chain data and not relying on the good grace of the infrastructure that sits beneath applications.</p>

<h1 id="todays-web-host-centric"><a class="header" href="#todays-web-host-centric">Today's web: host-centric</a></h1>
<p>Today's web revolves around hosts &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast">unicast</a> communication - we query <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> to get the IP of servers and open direct connections with them to retrieve the data that they host.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;DNS was invented at nearly the beginning of the Internet itself and pre-dated the Web, and has long been a centralized registry for the identity that mapped human-readable domain names for web-sites to IP addresses.&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But domains, URI paths on servers &amp; the actual files all change &amp; go away which leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> &amp; content drift. Guidance such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">&quot;Cool URIs don't change&quot;</a> is just that - guidance - and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> is just a bandaid that can hardly keep up with the digital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole">memory hole</a>. In the host-certified paradigm URLs at best point to a location at which a document may have been available at some point in time - devoid of any cryptographic proofs regarding the contents, the creator, an alternative way to retrieve it or the time of publication. The implications are explored in the <a href="host_centric.html#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">host-centric section in the motivation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="data-centric-computing"><a class="header" href="#data-centric-computing">Data-centric computing</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-centric_computing">Data-centric computing</a> is an emerging concept that has relevance in information architecture and data center design - data is stored independently of the applications, which can be upgraded without costly and complicated data migration. This is a radical shift in information systems that will be needed to address organizational needs for storing, retrieving, moving, and processing exponentially growing data sets. It increases agility by prioritizing data transfer and data computation. Applications become short-lived, constantly added, updated, or removed as algorithms come and go.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">Content-addressable storage</a> (CAS) is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content (not its location/name) and is a key piece of the puzzle. Identifiers are based on content and any change to a data element will necessarily change its content address. The most famous example of CAS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> but it suffers from non-human-friendly addresses (hashes), performance issues, and extreme latency (tens of minutes) because of the global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> if content is not widely cached/pinned.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">Self-authenticating data</a> moves authority from hosts to users. The three components that enable it are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">cryptographic identifiers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage">CAS</a>, and an emerging area of research called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> which is yet to be applied in any meaningful scale.</p>
<h1 id="information-centric-networking"><a class="header" href="#information-centric-networking">Information-centric networking</a></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-centric_networking">Information-centric networking</a> (ICN) is an approach to evolving the Internet infrastructure away from a host-centric paradigm, based on perpetual connectivity and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a>, to a network architecture in which the focal point is identified information (or content or data). Data becomes independent from location, application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and replication. The expected benefits are improved efficiency, better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand, and better robustness in challenging communication scenarios. In information-centric networking, the cache is a network-level solution, and it has rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, and smaller cache sizes.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_data_networking">Named Data Networking</a> (NDN) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Internet">Future Internet</a> architecture that builds on top of the previous ideas (&amp; an incarnation of ICN) and in which data is requested by name and routed by the network. However, there are many unsolved challenges with it like the need to reimplement foundational routing infrastructure to make it stateful and hierarchically structured names which require a root name authority to link them to keypairs - outside of its scope. Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM">a great lecture</a> on the topic.</p>
<h1 id="enter-headjack---the-final-iteration"><a class="header" href="#enter-headjack---the-final-iteration">Enter Headjack - the final iteration</a></h1>
<p>Headjack is a weird amalgamation inspired by everything above - it provides human-readable &amp; persistent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a> for self-authenticating data (with <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proofs</a> &amp; the blockchain) along with the means for its retrieval without forcing a specific way (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> is just one option). It acts as the web-scale global index used to check the authenticity of documents (requires consulting with the chain), ownership of names, key management &amp; sequence of events throughout time. It is an addressability layer on top of the current host-centric internet technologies.</p>

<h1 id="blob-construction---batching-of-user-events"><a class="header" href="#blob-construction---batching-of-user-events">Blob construction - batching of user events</a></h1>
<p>Applications accumulate off-chain activity from users which they cryptographically anchor in batches with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> on-chain and they determine how often to do so (it doesn't have to be on every block) - those with little activity may submit only once per minute or even less often - the frequency is determined by applications based on the volume of activity and the on-chain publishing costs.</p>
<p>When enough activity has been collected it is time for the application to finalize the batch: it is packed in a blob and all the events generated since the last anchored batch are sorted &amp; grouped by accounts in some deterministic way (perhaps accounts based on index and actions based on the type/sequence) with some schema with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The intra-blob index (offset table) for lookup of content of specific accounts is generated.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle root</a> that touches every event is deterministically constructed following a schema.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) for the blob is generated and it is pinned for others to download.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only 2 things that are signed &amp; submitted on-chain are thus the Merkle root and the IPFS CID for the next nonce (auto-increment counter) associated with the application account.</p>
<img src="images/blob_structure.png">
<!-- <object width=100% data="images/blob_structure.svg"></object> -->
<h1 id="stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing"><a class="header" href="#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a></h1>
<p>Applications maintain the logical order of events for the future batch in maps in order to provide intra-blob addressing even before it is fully constructed - as an example if a user posts an article and immediately after that comments on their own post - the comment should be able to refer to the post which is not yet committed on-chain. Applications will also display activity by other accounts that is not yet anchored and the interactions can still use the proper addressing when referring to the yet-to-be-anchored messages (the next nonce number is known in advance). Any type of interaction is addressable and sequenced in the blobs - including reactions (likes, etc).</p>
<h1 id="persistent--provable-uris"><a class="header" href="#persistent--provable-uris">Persistent &amp; provable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a></a></h1>
<p>Each account has an associated auto-increment counter (nonce) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content. So if an application has submitted 2 times already, then the next submission will be with <code>nonce == 3</code>. The blockchain keeps a mapping in its state for each previous nonce value to the block number when it changed so that <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> can be translated to which block has the Merkle root anchor &amp; <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> for the blob that corresponds to that nonce for that account.</p>
<!-- The 2 can be extracted from the block. -->
<img src="images/blob_URI.png">
<p>Once a blob is fetched through the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> (hash) we can address specific events by using the offset index in the blob header so a URI like <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_id&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> can point to a specific post, comment or even reaction (activity is grouped by users). The content ID for a specific user is usually a small single-digit number and is necessary only if there has been more than 1 interaction by that user through that application for the given nonce (maybe rare). This is what events with URIs referring to each other looks like:</p>
<img src="images/content_references.png">
<p>The blockchain can be queried if the application was allowed to post content on behalf of the user with an on-chain authorization (which probably happened through an <a href="IDM.html">IDM</a>) when that specific block was published in order to determine if the activity is authentic - the state keeps information for each account such as since what block number a given application was authorized to post on behalf of a user (and until when - all ranges). Users may avoid using IDMs and explicitly sign their actions in which case their data will be accompanied by their signatures within the data blobs and the only check required will be for the user keypair used for the specific block number.</p>
<h1 id="steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#steps-to-prove-the-authenticity-of-a-uri">Steps to prove the authenticity of a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap - to prove the authenticity of any event with a URI:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the data is actually part of an anchored blob with a <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-0-nite/merkle-proofs-explained-6dd429623dc5">Merkle proof</a> to a block. This requires either just the piece of data + a Merkle proof for inclusion in the blob or the entire blob in order to reconstruct the Merkle tree &amp; proof.</li>
<li>Then check if the user actually submitted the event:
<ul>
<li>Either if at that point the application was authorized to post on behalf of the user which would require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (authorization ranges).</li>
<li>Or by checking for an explicit signature &amp; the public key of that account at that time which would also require a Merkle proof for a part of the blockchain state (account key history).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>URIs are persistent as long as someone hosts either the individual event + the Merkle proof or the entire blob (and can reconstruct the proof) and knows to which block it was anchored (from the <code>&lt;application_id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;block_number&gt;</code> mapping). The <a href="names_and_paths.html">following chapter</a> shows how names in URIs are persistent too (even if user/application names change ownership at some point).</p>
<h1 id="a-few-other-notes"><a class="header" href="#a-few-other-notes">A few other notes</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>There can be many different &amp; valid proofs for the same URI from different block heights.</li>
<li>Even private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet">intranet</a> data may be anchored but not retrievable by the public if the blob IPFS CID is never published or pinned/hosted - unified addressing for public &amp; private.</li>
<li>Users should be able to see the URI of content even if created through another application and the origin should be displayed by default - acting as <a href="business_models.html">attribution for other applications</a>.</li>
<li>Edits &amp; updates to content come as <a href="messages.html">messages</a> with new unique URIs that reference the older message URIs and it is up to applications to properly handle this - either by showing that there have been changes and a newer version or automatically redirect to the latest. &quot;Forks&quot; are possible but they represent application failure to detect that an old version is being edited.</li>
<li>Accounts that anchor content on-chain cannot do so twice in the same block - for simplicity.</li>
</ul>
<!--

Blob construction is a trivially parallelizable problem

# On proof permanence

One thing to consider is if a user revokes the authorization of an application to post on their behalf retroactively - not just going forward but also invalidating all anchored content & follow/unfollow events for the last couple of days through that application. This would mean that cached Merkle proofs for such invalidated content will no longer be valid and the latest state of the blockchain will refuse to produce new such proofs, but the cached proofs could mislead someone. Retroactive revocation can happen only up to `X` days to limit the scope of changes to cached proofs & what infrastructure would need to handle but still give enough time for anyone to react in case an application has posted fraudulent activity on their behalf - a **mostly theoretical concern**. Proofs for blocks older than `X` days are therefore considered permanent.

<p>Headjack is also a name registry - accounts can own a handle and be identified with it. For specifics around the details (constraints, subdomains, auctions, distribution, hoarding, leasing, etc.) please refer to <a href="handles.html">their dedicated page</a>. In this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="names_and_paths.html#names-in-uris">Names in URIs</a></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="names-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#names-in-uris">Names in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Users and applications don't need a name and can operate as an integer index just fine, but the preferred case will be with handles. Names can change ownership but the blockchain will be able to translate <code>&lt;application_name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;/&lt;user_name&gt;/&lt;content_id&gt;</code> with strings into the canonical integer form discussed <a href="uris.html">previously</a> by substituting the application &amp; user names with account IDs.</p>
<p>Every name has an associated auto-increment nonce (just like account IDs) for every time they submit an anchor for off-chain content and the blockchain records maps of <code>&lt;name&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;id&gt;/&lt;nonce&gt;</code> which can then be used to resolve the URI as discussed in the <a href="uris.html">previous chapter</a>.</p>
<img src="images/account_name_state.png">
<p>But we need to be able to translate not just the application name but also the user name which may have changed ownership at any point - for that the blockchain keeps track of the account ID ownership of every name historically as ranges (from block X to block Y name N was owned by account A) so when we determine the block number for a given data blob we'd be able to check to which account ID does a name in a URI correspond to at that time.</p>
<!-- Additionally the user name <=> account ID mapping at the time of the blob could be embedded within the blob header (along with proofs) so that fewer queries are necessary to the blockchain. -->
<p>And thus we're able to have URIs such as <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> to identify any event by any actor - all we'd need to do is a few lookups and we'll be able to use Merkle proofs for any piece of content to prove authenticity. Most URIs could even omit the 4th part because probably there won't be more than 1 action by a user for a given batch by an application.</p>
<p>Note that the canonical form (numbers instead of names) of <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code> could be something like <code>42/783/523/3</code> where only the last number would be the same and the nonce would most likely be different. Also <code>twitter.com</code> might no longer be owned by account <code>42</code> but what matters is that the blockchain can correctly determine who owned it at nonce <code>55212</code>. Multiple names can be owned by an account but their nonces for one event will probably be different.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri"><a class="header" href="#what-to-ask-the-blockchain-about-a-uri">What to ask the blockchain about a URI</a></h1>
<p>To recap: we can ask the following questions about this URI: <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>To which application account ID &amp; nonce does <code>twitter.com/55212</code> correspond?</li>
<li>To which block does the applicationID/nonce map correspond?</li>
<li>What is the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> &amp; Merkle root of the anchored blob at that block?</li>
<li>What account ID does <code>johnny</code> correspond to in the block where this blob was anchored?</li>
<li>Once we download the blob or just the blob header (using the IPFS CID or any other means):
<ol>
<li>We can ask the offset table where within the blob is <code>johnny</code>'s content № <code>3</code>?</li>
<li>Once we fetch the actual data &amp; depending on whether it is explicitly signed or not:
<ol>
<li>either if the application was authorized to post on behalf of <code>johnny</code> at that time,</li>
<li>or if the signature matches the keypair that's been bound to <code>johnny</code>'s account at the time of the anchored block.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="web3-uris-interoperable-in-web2"><a class="header" href="#web3-uris-interoperable-in-web2">Web3 URIs interoperable in Web2</a></h1>
<p>Application accounts can point on-chain to a host with an IP address which can be used to display content published through them. Application names can also resemble traditional domain names so it will be possible to copy-paste such URIs directly into your browser and as long as they own the same domain in the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> they should be able to serve a webpage displaying the piece of content - enabling seamless interoperability during the transition from one paradigm to the other.</p>
<h1 id="content-titles-in-uris"><a class="header" href="#content-titles-in-uris">Content titles in URIs</a></h1>
<p>Most Web3 platforms <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1537388439259291649">suffer from unreadable URIs</a> but we've done a lot better - note the brevity and lack of hashes &amp; hexadecimal symbols (<code>0xf56a0...</code>) - in fact, this is as good as it gets...</p>
<p><strong>Or is it?!</strong> What about headlines of articles - can we have them included as well - something like <code>twitter.com/55212/johnny/3/how-I-went-from-vegan-to-keto-and-back-again</code>? Absolutely! The string is not at all necessary to resolve the piece of content (just like in StackOverflow where the database key for a question is just a number (example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4">question 4</a>) but the page router always changes the URL when loading the page to include the title too). <a href="messages.html">Message types</a> for posts with titles will have a dedicated field which will get included in the content hash and thus spoofing the title will be rejected by conforming applications as it would be a trivial check.</p>

<h1 id="addressing-within-content"><a class="header" href="#addressing-within-content">Addressing within content</a></h1>
<p>Different schemas could be used for addressing within pieces of content (like a paragraph from an article or a clip from audio/video - without losing the context of the whole) and message types could have by default associated on-chain schemas (or the schema of choice could be embedded within the header of the message). For example, when <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/121/66</code> is being loaded the associated schema will be looked up depending on the type of message (in this case - an article) and used to interpret the last part (<code>121/66</code>) which could mean a character selection with an offset from the start and length. The embedded schema could be overridden by explicitly stating which one to use within the URI. As an example, <code>medium.com/12475/elvis/0/learn-to-code/schema/42/121/187</code> could mean <code>&quot;use on-chain schema number 42&quot;</code> which could interpret the last part (<code>121/187</code>) as start offset and end offset instead of start &amp; length - resulting in the same selection as before. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1544001073844731904">individual pages &amp; paragraphs of books</a> should be referencable in such a manner and could be composed of multiple separate posts - and this is just scratching the surface!</p>
<p>For big types of content (audio/video) the message could be broken down into chunks so that users can load only the message header and then depending on the schema used and the addressing within the content - only the necessary chunks could be requested.</p>

new types of messages get an on-chain ID so subscriptions are integer-based


messages contain their URIs and also a local timestamp - although that could be spoofed. It is however useful for ordering things in certain cases

also contain the current block height in addition to a unix timestamp

- not yet anchored content from one application can refer to other not yet anchored content from another application and then the anchors could be in such an order that an event references another event in a future block (because apps can share activity before it being anchored).
    - could this problem be ignored?




the <application_id>/<application_nonce> is embedded in a message that's being signed through an application/IDM such that it cannot suffer from a replay attack

- if a reply message has the URI to the original in non canonical form it would be harder for infrastructure to match those - it would have to translate the string URI to a number URI

ways to both use an IDM and still direct your personal perferences & private stuff to be handled by something of your choosing



1 of N requirement for keeping the interest graph intact & being able to recover it from somewhere


the graph could be moved on-chain if there are many MB/s of DB throughput (possibly sharding) but that would put a lot of strain on the 


myspace-like page  (or linktree-like) where you paint the picture of you - as a map or as whatever - but content shouldn't be owned by separate platforms


Connections can be multidimensional with explicit filtering & exclusion of content based on its type/tag or application that it originates from - all of which will also be represented by integers.




In Headjack all connections in the [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) are asymmetric and also visible & on-chain as it is geared towards [public discourse](https://www.quora.com/Will-the-future-of-social-graph-relationships-be-asymmetric-following-e-g-Quora-Twitter-or-symmetric-friending-e-g-Facebook/answer/David-O-Sacks) but private ones for a social graph can also be achieved through encryption - handled & stored by [IDMs](IDM.md) with greater trust assumptions. However, being public by default (as is the case with Twitter) and focusing on that aspect first greatly improves discoverability and the chances to bootstrap the network effect - propagation & reach are sought after. Identities will have their own customized landing pages off-chain through an IDM.

- The importance of user data is on a spectrum with identity & connections being the most valuable - a clear example is [Substack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack) (basically [Medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)) but you own the mailing list for your audience). The [interest graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_graph) is the subscription layer for information propagation - a forward-looking & ever-evolving data structure that gets reused over and over again each time content is created. It is the [essential crown jewel](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1162539429484871681) that needs preservation - the global [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern). The data availability (DA - storage & retrievability) for identity & the interest graph needs to be guaranteed with cryptoeconomics on a permissionless ledger so anyone can build around it.

<p>In this chapter we will see the different aspects of handling unlimited amounts of off-chain data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="store_and_retrieve.html#ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data">Ingestion and transformation of blob data</a></li>

</ul>
<h1 id="ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data"><a class="header" href="#ingestion-and-transformation-of-blob-data">Ingestion and transformation of blob data</a></h1>
<p>Off-chain blobs with data will be fetched, processed and stored immediately after they are published in more optimal database formats for content to be later directly served by application infrastructure. Most of the cryptography checks will be happening instantly during this process but the proofs don't need to be stored. Users will always be able to request proofs for any event at any time (&amp; cache them locally) because they can be regenerated on the fly as necessary.</p>
<h1 id="hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches"><a class="header" href="#hierarchical-data-blobs--partial-fetches">Hierarchical data blobs &amp; partial fetches</a></h1>
<p>Blobs may be in a hierarchy such that the on-chain IPFS hash points only to the &quot;root&quot; blob that contains the header and the actual indexed data could be in child IPFS blobs (whose <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CIDs</a> are contained in the root blob or header) so entities listening for events by specific accounts on Headjack may download only these headers and determine which &quot;leaf&quot; blobs they need to fetch for the data they are interested in (if any). Sparse bitsets &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">bloom filters</a> could be used to quickly scan for the presence of activity by specific accounts.</p>
<img src="images/root_child_blob_separation.png">
<h1 id="direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling"><a class="header" href="#direct-ipfs-connections--horizontal-scaling">Direct IPFS connections &amp; horizontal scaling</a></h1>
<p>Applications can advertise the multiaddress of their IPFS nodes on-chain so that each blob of content that gets published can be downloaded by others instantly by manually connecting with IPFS’s <a href="https://medium.com/pinata/speeding-up-ipfs-pinning-through-swarm-connections-b509b1471986">“swarm connect” functionality</a> - avoiding the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a> for each new blob CID which may take tens of minutes. They can provide addresses to multiple IPFS nodes as a cluster for horizontal scaling and use <a href="https://ipfscluster.io/">Pinset orchestration</a> - designed for Automated data availability and redundancy.</p>
<p>Applications may choose not to use IPFS at all - what they must do is anchor their blobs with a Merkle root and provide some on-chain advertised means to retrieve the data (example: REST/RPC endpoints in their on-chain account). We expect that IPFS will be the lowest common denominator and will always be used no matter what other solutions are also available.</p>
<h1 id="sharing-data-before-anchoring-it"><a class="header" href="#sharing-data-before-anchoring-it">Sharing data before anchoring it</a></h1>
<p>Applications can talk to each other directly by using their on-chain advertised REST/RPC endpoints and may ask for the events &amp; messages that are not yet published by the other applications. This way they could display &quot;remote&quot; events locally while they are still in the &quot;mempool&quot; and allow their own users to interact with those events from other applications. This is possible because URIs are stable even before publication - see <a href="blobs_and_uris.html#stable-intra-blob-addressing-before-publishing">Stable intra-blob addressing before publishing</a>. High activity applications can interoperate and no longer be a slave to the block time. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications should display events that are not yet anchored in the UI differently - especially if coming from another application.</li>
<li>Events that refer to each other but are from different applications and have not yet been anchored on-chain could end up committed in the wrong order (if one of the applications skips a few blocks and commits at a later one) - such that an event from the past is referring to an event from the future - breaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity">referential integrity</a>. However, <a href="messages.html">messages</a> have a timestamp field and could also have the current block height at the time of creation - useful for sorting.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri"><a class="header" href="#how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri">How to retrieve data for a random URI</a></h1>
<p>There are multiple options:</p>
<!-- TODO:
"The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages." ===> SHOULD BE ALSO ABLE TO ASK THE IDM OF THE USER !!! -->
<ul>
<li>The entire original blob with an <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/">IPFS CID</a> might still be retrievable from the original application account that posted it or anyone else that has pinned the data.</li>
<li>The user account might be using an archival service for all their activity and they can point to that archival service on-chain in their account for others to retrieve their messages.</li>
<li>Other well-known players without a direct on-chain connection to the application/user in a URI could be asked if they have the content:
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure companies that do the heavy lifting for applications and store everything.</li>
<li>The analog of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive">Internet Archive</a> in this ecosystem that also stores everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPFS can be forked &amp; reused with the following change: instead of delivering content based on the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a> hash it can deliver the data + the necessary proofs based on Headjack URIs or their hash (they are unique) - any individual off-chain message that's been anchored would be retrievable as long as someone is hosting it in this p2p network (which needs bootstrapping - could be part of Headjack nodes). However, this won't be very performant due to the granular nature of individual messages with a URI and the use of a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table">DHT</a>.</li>

Look at ethereum block & state structure
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/268/ethereum-block-architecture
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/


with small pieces of data the proofs for them could be orders of magnitude bigger - with Headjack storing them is not necessary as they can be derived from the original data blobs and the current state of the chain - a small core capable of producing the proofs for unlimited amounts of off-chain content

== there are 2 aspects when linking identity to a piece of data:

- merkle proof linking the data to a block
    - entities needs to keep either:
        - the full IPFS blobs and no merkle trees - can reconstruct a merkle proof for any piece of data at any time
        - or just the parts they care about + merkle proofs for each part to link them to a block
            - for multiple pieces of data can be optimized with merkle pollards and/or (sparse) multiproofs
    - if the state doesn't keep historical mapping of block numbers & identities to IPFS hashes:
        - there needs to be a merkle proof within the block
- merkle proofs linking identities to authorized services or keypairs at a specific block height




if the history of key rotations & revocations is not guaranteed, then data cannot be self-authenticating

events must be self-authenticating - and not requiring that the source (original creator) be always around to provide proofs for their authenticity.

# Block structure

- Transactions (token transfers)
- Registration/updates of applications
    - Sources for ephemeral content generated on the application - IPFS, Ceramic, HTTPS, etc.
- Blobs of data from each separate application
    - Follow/unfollow events
    - Update/delete account info/handle
    - Merkle root of all new content generated by the application
- Root hash of the state (connections, applications & accounts)



# What is in a block

- account actions
    - token transfers
    - IDM-like:
        - create new accounts without a keypair
        - binding & updating keypairs (changes require signature from the previous key)
        - list of application authorizations & revocations for accounts that it controls (each of which is just an integer pair - `56 => 661`)
    - Application-like:
        - content blob Merkle root
        - content blob IPFS CID
        - list of follow/unfollow actions for accounts (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
        - Application-related info updates
            - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
            - keypair updates


- IDM batches
    - list of application authorizations & revocations (integers pairs - `56 => 661`)
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - keypair binding & changes (changes require signature from the previous key)
    - IDM-related info updates
- Application batches
    - follow/unfollow events (integers pairs - `67 => 27`)
    - content Merkle root
    - content blob IPFS CID 
    - Application-related info updates
        - IPFS node (cluster) address updates
        - keypair updates
- State root - the Merkle root for the latest materialized state

In reality a single account may play [all 3 roles](identity.md) - normal user, IDM & Application, so end users may even authorize applications & post content themselves as long as they have a keypair & the funds to pay for their direct on-chain transactions. The distinction here is to help paint the picture.

# Materialized state

For Headjack the state throughout history is much more important when compared to financial applications because there will be much more queries to prove things in the past (again and again) compared to just the present. Also, because 


TODO: does the state actually need to contain the historical mapping? not necessarily as third-party services could be doing that, but forcing full nodes to do it properly in the state & maintaining consensus would simplify the architecture of the rest


TODO: need examples & specifics for how big URI proofs would be


Make a graph with a block and txs and merkle roots




An account has the following properties:
- `ID` (`integer`) - unique on the blockchain, autoincrement, starting from 1
- `sig` - cryptographic address & signature
    - can be null ONLY if an `acm_id` is present
- `acm_id` (`integer`) - ACM ID - which [ACM](acm.md) can grant access to [applications](applications.md)
    - can be null ONLY if a `sig` is present

Other less important fields:

- `block_created` (`integer`) - in which block was the account first created

<h1 id="how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction"><a class="header" href="#how-big-is-a-headjack-transaction">How big is a Headjack transaction</a></h1>
<p>Applications post anchors to off-chain content with an IPFS CID hash and a merkle root. IDMs also anchor off-chain content (mainly user preferences &amp; updates to social graph), but they also post authorizations to other accounts (applications) to post on behalf of users as integer pairs.</p>
<p>So the fields for a transaction by an application/IDM (which will be the majority) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>version: <code>4 bytes</code></li>
<li>signature: <a href="https://ethvigil.com/docs/eth_sign_example_code/#recovering-the-message-signer-in-the-smart-contract"><code>65 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob IPFS address: <a href="https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid/01"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>blob merkle root: <a href="https://www.mycryptopedia.com/merkle-tree-merkle-root-explained/"><code>32 bytes</code></a></li>
<li>nonce: <code>4 bytes</code> auto-increment integer associated with the account - to prevent reordering of anchored off-chain blobs (which would mess up internal addressing based on that nonce)</li>
<li>value: <code>4 bytes</code> amount of native token paid to validators for transaction inclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>So far that is <code>141 bytes</code> which almost every transaction by an application or IDM contains. IDMs also submit a list of authorizations (or revocations) as integer pairs. For example, 1000 accounts authorizing 15 different applications to post on their behalf would be 1000 integer pairs. Assuming 8 byte integers (up to 2^64) that would be 8 * 2 * 1000 = 16k bytes.</p>
<h1 id="naive-scenario"><a class="header" href="#naive-scenario">Naive scenario</a></h1>

This is not a problem for <a href="https://twitter.com/eshita/status/1546911451125649408"> ZK validiums</a> as there are already DA solutions that offer <a href="https://twitter.com/apolynya/status/1517137629334056960">10 mb/s or even much more</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 MB block size &amp; 10 second block time (100 kb/s of block bandwidth)</li>
<li>1000 applications posting in every block</li>
<li>100 IDMs authorizing as much users as possible - filling the remaining block space</li>
<li>no on-chain actions such as keypair &amp; name changes, account creation &amp; direct interaction with the chain by end users</li>
</ul>
<p>We get:</p>
<ul>
<li>1100 actors (1000 applications + 100 IDMs) that post in every block at least <code>141</code> bytes for their transactions, which is <code>155100</code> bytes</li>
<li>the remaining <code>893476</code> bytes (1048576 (1MB) - 155100) can be filled with authorizations and since an authorization is <code>16</code> bytes (8 * 2) that would be 55842 authorizations/revocations every 10 seconds or 5584 authorizations/revocations per second</li>
<li>for 1 billion accounts that would be 0.557 authorizations/revocations per person per day which is actually quite good - people on average do way less <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-ons</a> per day</li>

<h1 id="realistic-scenario"><a class="header" href="#realistic-scenario">Realistic scenario</a></h1>
<p>The naive scenario does not include on-chain actions for specific accounts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>keypair changes (new pubkey (32 bytes) + signature (65 bytes) if there is an older key)</li>
<li>account creation (if done by an IDM then this is just a few bytes - no pubkey)</li>
<li>name registration &amp; ownership changes (see the <a href="handles.html">dedicated page</a> for more details)</li>

<p>However, the realistic scenario will not be far from the naive because:</p>

<li>Only a % of all accounts will have keypairs (even though 100% could) and will make just a few signed actions per year - leaving most block throughput for authorizations through IDMs.</li>
<li>Large % of accounts will rarely even be authorizing new applications - many people don't sign in to new services through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">SSO</a> every single day. There could also be 2 types of log-ins: passive (viewing only - nothing on-chain) and authorized (allowing services to post on behalf of users).</li>
<li>Many applications that don't generate a lot of off-chain activity will publish less often than on every block in order to minimize on-chain block space costs.</li>

- no?</p>
<img src="images/account_name_state.png">
<!-- 

The growth of the chain and the state will differ by a few things:


One difference between Headjack and financial blockchains is that they don't force historical records into the state whereas that is the main value proposition of Headjack.



This is a solution that is provably possible and better and can only get better in time with further innovation and scaling


The goal is to avoid congestion and provide enough bandwidth in a predictable way for web scale



This could be a concern when Headjack takes over the world - if blocks are 10 mb once every 10 seconds the chain would grow by 86 gb/day. However, 

The processing of the state machine is minimal - orders of magnitude less complexity & compute compared to generalized smart contract platforms

The state growth will be slower than the blockchain growth because:

- an on-chain authorization is a pair of integers while only 1 integer goes into the state


goal: no congestion


a tiny core on which we have consensus can be used to cryptographically anchor & link unlimited amounts of data - the entire web - a few terabytes (tiny is relative - compared to the data) of materialized blockchain state including the absolute bare minimum of historic.

- state doesn't need to store the merkle roots & IPFS hashes - merkle proofs can contain block numbers & block hashes -->
<p>TODO: light clients? in addition to merkle proofs for inclusion of content they would need merkle proofs for the state of which applications a user has authorized to post on their behalf in a given block</p>

<h1 id="off-chain-content"><a class="header" href="#off-chain-content">Off-chain content</a></h1>
<p>There are no limits for off-chain content as it is all just anchored with merkle roots - it could be as high as hundreds of terabytes per second. There isn't a more minimal design that can link unbounded amounts of off-chain data to billions of identities that can change keys &amp; names and yet still provide the guarantees &amp; mental model simplicity of Headjack - it achieves consensus on the absolute bare minimum.</p>
<!-- validium

This design for a specialized blockchain can scale practically as much as necessary due to the compactness of service messages and the triviality of sharding the blockchain as there would be close to 0 cross-shard communication (`"X follows Y"` only affects `X`) and that is [provable with easy to grasp napkin math](numbers.md).

<p>This chapter focuses on the disadvantages of some of the more high-profile competing solutions in the space. Most of the issues are solved in Headjack due to its <a href="principles.html">guiding principles &amp; design goals</a>. This page doesn't list any of their positives as it would be too long (so not exhaustive by any means) but many of them have served as an inspiration for Headjack in one way or another.</p>

avoiding signatures by default - only hashing - much faster
asymmetric cryptography is SLOW
https://medium.com/logos-network/benchmarking-hash-and-signature-algorithms-6079735ce05
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/38043/hmac-vs-rsa-speed

bloat because of individual signatures - versus computable hashes that don't need to be stored

DA is very important for DID resolution - if there's no guaranteed DA - there's no guaranteed resolution.


authentic timestamps?

how easy it is to build aggregators for the entire public web?

are applications bottlenecked by the personal data repository of a user? yes in the case of farcaster & bluesky

Openness enables gradual evolvability

4. I wonder what the team will do for authentication and authorization? Will they go the ACL route? (In which case, are they going to include Solid-style client identity, in the ACLs?) Will they go the capabilities route? (UCANs / zCaps). This is the genuine hard part.


**Size matters**
**Smaller is better**
regarding IDs & URIs



Having the app id and doing batch commitments simplifies routing and aids self-authenticity for documents

names are worthless if they aren't in URIs pointing to documents

the p2p layer is often the biggest & easiest attack surface for protocols - that's why headjack aims to have the hardest possible guarantees for the root of everything - identifiers, keys, names and off-chain ways for off-protocol contact

the problem with the IPFS/Filecoin address space (and any that is data-centric with hashes) is that it is flat - and thus the network suffers when scaled

farcaster is a specific social networking protocol that is trying to also handle consistency & conflicts - like not allowing double liking of a post by a specific user, etc.

Their product-led protocol development strategy means they need to chase product-like targets when designing a foundational protocol. Following [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

!!!!!

Farcaster can be entirely rebuilt on top of Headjack but not everything that Headjack enables can be built on top of Farcaster.

https://chapterone.substack.com/i/77871905/product-led-protocol-development
No - product-led protocol development is rarely the best way forward if you get the foundations wrong - iterating out of a local maximum may prove impossible and kill the product. Once there is a yet-unsustainable product that requries money, there is also a timer that is ticking.

With Farcaster, content is directory-certified and cannot be fully self-authenticating because if the directory to which the on-chain account points to goes away - so does the credibility for any piece of data by that account - no way to cache proofs. Furthermore, directories can be tampered with and currently it's up to the p2p network to keep track if any malicious changes happen



farcaster - their model can work even without the p2p nodes - aggregators can be built that talk directly to host directories

farcaster can be built on top of Headjack but not everything that can be built on Headjack can on Farcaster

Farcaster is the best team in the space.

<p>Their architecture: <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol">link</a>. The account registry is on a blockchain and everything else is off-chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registry on Ethereum L1 - for new accounts, name/host changes &amp; key management.</p>
<ul>
<li>No plans on moving to an L2 or their own chain. Also, state rent could eventually be introduced to Ethereum which would lead to further costs &amp; complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keypairs &amp; wallets required - harder mass adoption. Authorizations still <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#45-signer-authorizations">require a signature from the root key</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocations invalidate all prior activity from a delegate:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#46-root-signer-revocations">Root signer revocations</a> are even more impactful.</li>
</ul>

<!-- - Cast timestamps are self-reported and can be manipulated - no true cryptographic total ordering - which leads to a lot of complexity in the node software. Not sure what happens to old casts that were signed with obsolete keypairs and how the history of keys is handled. -->
<!-- message ordering, timestamps & authenticity can be manipulated which requires more logic in the software to keep track of previous hashes

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#5-peering">p2p network</a>'s ability to scale by passing around granular casts is questionable - they are already discussing possible flooding and nodes having to shadow ban and flag accounts based on behavior.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: problem with farcaster - you cannot save content from others forever with authentic proofs if the person removes completely their history of key changes & content signatures. Correct? -->
<!-- Directly polling accounts & their hosts for new events is more scalable but has tradeoffs compared to broadcasting messages & ingesting them into DBs & indexes (pull vs push). -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus is on <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#47-sharding">partial views of the network</a> as opposed to mass scale aggregation &amp; indexing - although that could easily be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/pull/1/files">Cast URIs</a> will look something like <code>farcaster://id:8789213729/cast:0xf00b4r</code> which is less readable than what Headjack will be offering with <a href="addressing.html">its addressing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall good intuition about the concept of <a href="https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks">sufficient decentralization</a> (putting only what is absolutely necessary on a blockchain) but the p2p node implementation takes on too much <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#7-security-considerations">responsibility, complexity &amp; assumptions</a> (consensus, CRDTs, trees, ordering, flooding &amp; replay attacks, etc.) and is lacking in other areas.</p>

<p>Frequency (a Polkadot parachain) is the first implementation of DSNP (Decentralized Social Networking Protocol - <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>) as a standalone blockchain and has had the most influence over Headjack's design but the two have diverged in some key respects - the biggest of which are scalability, content addressability, UX &amp; choosing Polkadot. Some of the problems with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No names within the project - just integer IDs for accounts. Content addressing URIs are based on hashes without connection to the batch # / service that published it - example: <code>dsnp://78187493520/0x1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</code> (<a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identifiers.html#dsnp-content-uri">source</a>). Addressing content is much worse compared to Headjack's <a href="addressing.html">human-readable &amp; persistent URIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegating applications to be able to post on behalf of users (analogous to authorization in Headjack) happens on-chain but requires a signature from the user (bulky - limiting throughput). New applications (&amp; revocation) require the user to have access to their keys. Hierarchical delegation would allow for UX comparable to Web2 and would even allow for users without keypairs at all but DSNP doesn't have that - Headjack does. <!-- https://discord.com/channels/969001918460469250/969308056208961606/996417552962043924 --></p>

deleting an old post requires re-merkleization of the tree

competition page: batching & compactness (FC does have some fancy hub sync)

farcaster is too opinionated

Key rotation in competition - for lens perhaps account abstraction would help

Farcaster: with or without CRDTs you should be processing everything anyway, and with a simple fork choice rule you wouldnt need crdts

identifier type in the table - integer or hash of public key - in competition table

Farcaster - when there isnt a grand vision outsiders implement twitter interface clones with some differences in coloring and layout. And thats it.



In int64 we trust - with an oreol
Joinability
You can stuff integers in bitmaps and check for intersections - hashes suck
Anything not built around integers is disqualified due to joinability & maskability

Twitter’s servers cost 1.5 billion per year - we need to engineer for web-scale
https://twitter.com/ashleevance/status/1605448764851752961
https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1605448752881229824

Simplifying joining is killer f

Add joining in the pitch


Farcaster arent thinking bih enough - crdts are a crutch - an unnecessary constraint

Anything without built-in incentives is not suitable as a foundation


Guaranteed resolvability

Signing with a private ley requires it to always be loaded - for every new event
Contrast that to auth tokens - they are created once and reused many times - only the point of creation needs the highest security



with farcaster all the activity of a user is chained linearly & merklized and that means there's a bottleneck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVI2uKgHtY
although that does solve problems that are present in headjack...


Farcaster blocktime - slow but very rarely needed

on Nostr
https://twitter.com/pippellia/status/1605970256807206912



In case an IDM or application is compromised (but not their keys - only the servers to some extent) it could invalidate all access tokens with a single compact range message - not individually

farcaster - limits on the number of signer keys, also what is the revocation process like?

designing from first principles - what needs to be decentralized? what's the common use case for 99.9% of cases? what are the guarantees we should provide - and nothing less?
headjack is an exercise in minimalism

> "Computer scientists, faced with the challenge of scaling, tend to fall back on a hierarchical scheme." - [source](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1127699384102080514)

> "We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection." - [The fundamental theorem of software engineering (FTSE) by Andrew Koenig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering)


in entity resolution (if records from different data sources represent the same entity) consistency & latency are key, and so is brevity/compactness


timestamped events?
    farcaster - no, user reported timestamp
    "Delta timestamps can be used by applications when generating feeds of information for their users. Such timestamps are untrustworthy since they are user reported and the network cannot verify them. The timestamp trust model is like that of a blog where most users tend to be well behaved since a monitoring service at the application level can be used to detect timestamp abuse."

App id/name in URIs for content generated through them

proofs for the authorization or key ownership at the point of publication are not necessary! they can be reconstructed !!!

infra need to store signatures & proofs?

upper limit for total data on the network/protocol






- competition - finish it !!!

    - Point when comparing with others: multiple ways to ask for data from an URI as opposed to just a hash
    - a URI is not connected to multiple entities and not just a hash - the application & user
    - Others con - addressability does not include application names - no such direct client attribution mechanism
    
    - just because you can interlink everything with hashes doesn't mean that you should



    - page about the key rotation & anchoring problem and where does the key rotation & revocation data live & latencies? - aka WHY SEQUENCE THIS


ANCHORING IS NOT ENOUGH! - you need to know which event invalidated the previous one without having to check if it was invalidated

ordering guarantees?

Pruned sets - how/which data is stored by hubs
The protocol is trying to do too much
Very opinionated - way beyond just decentralized identity
the hub implementation has a lot of tough choices to make in regards to rate limiting, spam & storage limits/guarantees
there is a consensus algorithm about 
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj

farcaster makes the hubs a bottleneck for applications - instead of allowing different apps to provide their own storage

All this complexity of sets, CRDTs, pruning & size limitations stems from the inability to address content by users without it being created by the hub - a user's hub is a bottleneck for applications
What is a [CausalRemovesWinIfValid](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj) set?

> "We expect users to resign their messages when migrating between clients" - [source](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HJzK5VM4o)
wow...
"When a signer is removed, all messages signed by it present in other CRDT's must now be considered invalid and evicted from those CRDTs."
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#72-signers
however, even a custory address may change but it may re-authorize signers.
but if a signer was compromised you have to lose everything signed by it

A negative for headjack is that it's not trivial to obtain the latest version of a document for a URI - if it was deleted you'd probably need to ask the app or the IDM of the user if they have an update, but that update could have been submitted by another app



Without anchoring data with a Merkle proof and sequencing that in time, it is impossible for a document to be fully self-authenticating because it might have been signed with keys that have been compromised/revoked/rotated.

Encoding metadata in the uri avoids the need for requests


A single on-chain message that updates an rpc/rest endpoint can redirect trillions of URIs and exabytes of data instantly - no global DHT used for individual elements

When a key is rotated it doesn’t affect old content for it to be self-authenticating

Insight: names are most useful when in document URIs - not used to identify your personal finances publicly

just like we need IP over MAC addresses in order to have a hierarchy, for the same reason we need Headjack URIs on top of hashed data - the retrievability process is greatly improved

benefit: no need to store proofs for every single event as they can be derived

flexibility - addressing is forever - but the storage & architecture of any application can be changed - without breaking the addressing.

Farcaster focuses on eventual consistency with CRDTs & Delta Graphs but the elephant in the room is different counts based on different filters which cannot be done with CRDTs easily.
ACTUALLY not sure if that's true :|
but perhaps CRDTs are just not as performant for trillions of likes
Our view is that using CRDTs is a constraint - like for example multi-dimensional follows with include/exclude filtering
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#3-delta-graph

limits on data? size & retention?
CRDTs are a limit for Farcaster.
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#33-bounding-graph-size
https://hackmd.io/fCa8_RCEQ4qBYZjfnas9Zg



partial view of the network allowed?
    not for farcaster

Why go theough the trouble of dealing with crdts and constrains if youll solve just one basic case and not everything thats possible?


They aim for Hubs to have a complete view of the network and are aiming for everything to fit in 64TB o_O

"we limit users to storing a finite number of deltas for each type and calculate the limits to keep the size of the graph under 64 TB."




farcaster is too constraining because of the use of CRDTs
The system cannot be extended by anyone because the Hubs need to agree to run the software that handles any new message type. The protocol is tied to the infra.


Farcaster: a lot of complexity, a lot of limitations and no clear path to being general purpose & web-scale




integer keys as opposed to hash-based keys - so that filtering is easy - by and/or-ing bitmaps
this goes in competition table!

hash-based intra-PDR addressing - could get very bloated

if a user's PDR goes away all cached documents are no longer linkable to their identity

- **Consortium** of nodes & a transparency log manage the DID registry.
    - Centralization point (not just [logical](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)) - users can be kicked off.
    - This should have been a credibly neutral & self-sustaining blockchain.

- Requires the use of keypairs which is worse UX compared to Headjack and would hinder mass adoption - although they do talk about [custodial solutions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/docs/#root-private-key-management).

- When users post content they update their Personal Data Repositories managed by their Personal Data Servers (PDS) which play somewhat similar roles to [Farcaster](#farcaster)'s managed hosts and Headjack's [IDMs](IDM.md).

- Users can lose their interest graph if the PDS they are using loses their data.

- The Personal Data Repositories would be a lot less compact than Headjack because accounts and links between them are not simple integers and every piece of data and relationship comes along with a signature.

Overall a solid effort and could work - some similarities to [Farcaster](#farcaster) but the DID registry is centralized by a consortium and the usernames are email-like (DNS - centralization point) instead of handled by the DID registry. Neither solution anchors content like Headjack does. -->

avoiding signatures by default - only hashing - much faster
asymmetric cryptography is SLOW
https://medium.com/logos-network/benchmarking-hash-and-signature-algorithms-6079735ce05
https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/38043/hmac-vs-rsa-speed

bloat because of individual signatures - versus computable hashes that don't need to be stored

DA is very important for DID resolution - if there's no guaranteed DA - there's no guaranteed resolution.


authentic timestamps?

how easy it is to build aggregators for the entire public web?

are applications bottlenecked by the personal data repository of a user? yes in the case of farcaster & bluesky

Openness enables gradual evolvability

discoverability

bluesky - dependence on DNS

row: type of account key or joinability or compactness of key: number or (hash of) public key - only farcaster green besides headjack

4. I wonder what the team will do for authentication and authorization? Will they go the ACL route? (In which case, are they going to include Solid-style client identity, in the ACLs?) Will they go the capabilities route? (UCANs / zCaps). This is the genuine hard part.


**Size matters**
**Smaller is better**
regarding IDs & URIs



Having the app id and doing batch commitments simplifies routing and aids self-authenticity for documents

names are worthless if they aren't in URIs pointing to documents

the p2p layer is often the biggest & easiest attack surface for protocols - that's why headjack aims to have the hardest possible guarantees for the root of everything - identifiers, keys, names and off-chain ways for off-protocol contact

the problem with the IPFS/Filecoin address space (and any that is data-centric with hashes) is that it is flat - and thus the network suffers when scaled

The winner take all singleton is the easiest mentally

having everything from a user in a tree with a root hash - easier replication

farcaster is a specific social networking protocol that is trying to also handle consistency & conflicts - like not allowing double liking of a post by a specific user, etc.

Their product-led protocol development strategy means they need to chase product-like targets when designing a foundational protocol. Following [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law), when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

!!!!!

Farcaster can be entirely rebuilt on top of Headjack but not everything that Headjack enables can be built on top of Farcaster.

No - product-led protocol development is rarely the best way forward if you get the foundations wrong - iterating out of a local maximum may prove impossible and kill the product. Once there is a yet-unsustainable product that requries money, there is also a timer that is ticking.

With Farcaster, content is directory-certified and cannot be fully self-authenticating because if the directory to which the on-chain account points to goes away - so does the credibility for any piece of data by that account - no way to cache proofs. Furthermore, directories can be tampered with and currently it's up to the p2p network to keep track if any malicious changes happen



farcaster - their model can work even without the p2p nodes - aggregators can be built that talk directly to host directories

farcaster can be built on top of Headjack but not everything that can be built on Headjack can on Farcaster

Farcaster is the best team in the space.

<p>Their architecture: <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol">link</a>. The account registry is on a blockchain and everything else is off-chain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registry on Ethereum L1 - for new accounts, name/host changes &amp; key management.</p>
<ul>
<li>No plans on moving to an L2 or their own chain. Also, state rent could eventually be introduced to Ethereum which would lead to further costs &amp; complexity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keypairs &amp; wallets required - harder mass adoption. Authorizations still <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#45-signer-authorizations">require a signature from the root key</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revocations invalidate all prior activity from a delegate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, this means that all messages signed by that signer will be lost since we cannot tell which ones were signed by the attacker.&quot; - <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#71-signer-compromise">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#46-root-signer-revocations">Root signer revocations</a> are even more impactful.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- - Cast timestamps are self-reported and can be manipulated - no true cryptographic total ordering - which leads to a lot of complexity in the node software. Not sure what happens to old casts that were signed with obsolete keypairs and how the history of keys is handled. -->
<!-- message ordering, timestamps & authenticity can be manipulated which requires more logic in the software to keep track of previous hashes
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#message-ordering -->
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#5-peering">p2p network</a>'s ability to scale by passing around granular casts is questionable - they are already discussing possible flooding and nodes having to shadow ban and flag accounts based on behavior.</li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: problem with farcaster - you cannot save content from others forever with authentic proofs if the person removes completely their history of key changes & content signatures. Correct? -->
<!-- Directly polling accounts & their hosts for new events is more scalable but has tradeoffs compared to broadcasting messages & ingesting them into DBs & indexes (pull vs push). -->
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus is on <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#47-sharding">partial views of the network</a> as opposed to mass scale aggregation &amp; indexing - although that could easily be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/pull/1/files">Cast URIs</a> will look something like <code>farcaster://id:8789213729/cast:0xf00b4r</code> which is less readable than what Headjack will be offering with <a href="addressing.html">its addressing</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall good intuition about the concept of <a href="https://www.varunsrinivasan.com/2022/01/11/sufficient-decentralization-for-social-networks">sufficient decentralization</a> (putting only what is absolutely necessary on a blockchain) but the p2p node implementation takes on too much <a href="https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol#7-security-considerations">responsibility, complexity &amp; assumptions</a> (consensus, CRDTs, trees, ordering, flooding &amp; replay attacks, etc.) and is lacking in other areas.</p>

<p>Frequency (a Polkadot parachain) is the first implementation of DSNP (Decentralized Social Networking Protocol - <a href="https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/papers/blob/main/whitepaper/dsnp_whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>) as a standalone blockchain and has had the most influence over Headjack's design but the two have diverged in some key respects - the biggest of which are scalability, content addressability, UX &amp; choosing Polkadot. Some of the problems with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No names within the project - just integer IDs for accounts. Content addressing URIs are based on hashes without connection to the batch # / service that published it - example: <code>dsnp://78187493520/0x1234567890abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef</code> (<a href="https://spec.dsnp.org/DSNP/Identifiers.html#dsnp-content-uri">source</a>). Addressing content is much worse compared to Headjack's <a href="addressing.html">human-readable &amp; persistent URIs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delegating applications to be able to post on behalf of users (analogous to authorization in Headjack) happens on-chain but requires a signature from the user (bulky - limiting throughput). New applications (&amp; revocation) require the user to have access to their keys. Hierarchical delegation would allow for UX comparable to Web2 and would even allow for users without keypairs at all but DSNP doesn't have that - Headjack does. <!-- https://discord.com/channels/969001918460469250/969308056208961606/996417552962043924 --></p>

deleting an old post requires re-merkleization of the tree

competition page: batching & compactness (FC does have some fancy hub sync)

farcaster is too opinionated

Key rotation in competition - for lens perhaps account abstraction would help

Farcaster: with or without CRDTs you should be processing everything anyway, and with a simple fork choice rule you wouldnt need crdts

identifier type in the table - integer or hash of public key - in competition table

Farcaster - when there isnt a grand vision outsiders implement twitter interface clones with some differences in coloring and layout. And thats it.



In int64 we trust - with an oreol
Joinability
You can stuff integers in bitmaps and check for intersections - hashes suck
Anything not built around integers is disqualified due to joinability & maskability

Twitter’s servers cost 1.5 billion per year - we need to engineer for web-scale
https://twitter.com/ashleevance/status/1605448764851752961
https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1605448752881229824

Simplifying joining is killer f

Add joining in the pitch


Farcaster arent thinking bih enough - crdts are a crutch - an unnecessary constraint

Anything without built-in incentives is not suitable as a foundation


Guaranteed resolvability

Signing with a private ley requires it to always be loaded - for every new event
Contrast that to auth tokens - they are created once and reused many times - only the point of creation needs the highest security



with farcaster all the activity of a user is chained linearly & merklized and that means there's a bottleneck
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVI2uKgHtY
although that does solve problems that are present in headjack...


Farcaster blocktime - slow but very rarely needed

on Nostr
https://twitter.com/pippellia/status/1605970256807206912



In case an IDM or application is compromised (but not their keys - only the servers to some extent) it could invalidate all access tokens with a single compact range message - not individually

farcaster - limits on the number of signer keys, also what is the revocation process like?

designing from first principles - what needs to be decentralized? what's the common use case for 99.9% of cases? what are the guarantees we should provide - and nothing less?
headjack is an exercise in minimalism

> "Computer scientists, faced with the challenge of scaling, tend to fall back on a hierarchical scheme." - [source](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1127699384102080514)

> "We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection." - [The fundamental theorem of software engineering (FTSE) by Andrew Koenig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering)


in entity resolution (if records from different data sources represent the same entity) consistency & latency are key, and so is brevity/compactness


timestamped events?
    farcaster - no, user reported timestamp
    "Delta timestamps can be used by applications when generating feeds of information for their users. Such timestamps are untrustworthy since they are user reported and the network cannot verify them. The timestamp trust model is like that of a blog where most users tend to be well behaved since a monitoring service at the application level can be used to detect timestamp abuse."

App id/name in URIs for content generated through them

proofs for the authorization or key ownership at the point of publication are not necessary! they can be reconstructed !!!

infra need to store signatures & proofs?

upper limit for total data on the network/protocol






- competition - finish it !!!

    - Point when comparing with others: multiple ways to ask for data from an URI as opposed to just a hash
    - a URI is not connected to multiple entities and not just a hash - the application & user
    - Others con - addressability does not include application names - no such direct client attribution mechanism
    
    - just because you can interlink everything with hashes doesn't mean that you should



    - page about the key rotation & anchoring problem and where does the key rotation & revocation data live & latencies? - aka WHY SEQUENCE THIS


ANCHORING IS NOT ENOUGH! - you need to know which event invalidated the previous one without having to check if it was invalidated

ordering guarantees?

Pruned sets - how/which data is stored by hubs
The protocol is trying to do too much
Very opinionated - way beyond just decentralized identity
the hub implementation has a lot of tough choices to make in regards to rate limiting, spam & storage limits/guarantees
there is a consensus algorithm about 
https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj

farcaster makes the hubs a bottleneck for applications - instead of allowing different apps to provide their own storage

All this complexity of sets, CRDTs, pruning & size limitations stems from the inability to address content by users without it being created by the hub - a user's hub is a bottleneck for applications
What is a [CausalRemovesWinIfValid](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/BJj3zuVVj) set?

> "We expect users to resign their messages when migrating between clients" - [source](https://hackmd.io/@farcasterxyz/HJzK5VM4o)
wow...
"When a signer is removed, all messages signed by it present in other CRDT's must now be considered invalid and evicted from those CRDTs."
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#72-signers
however, even a custory address may change but it may re-authorize signers.
but if a signer was compromised you have to lose everything signed by it

A negative for headjack is that it's not trivial to obtain the latest version of a document for a URI - if it was deleted you'd probably need to ask the app or the IDM of the user if they have an update, but that update could have been submitted by another app



Without anchoring data with a Merkle proof and sequencing that in time, it is impossible for a document to be fully self-authenticating because it might have been signed with keys that have been compromised/revoked/rotated.

Encoding metadata in the uri avoids the need for requests


A single on-chain message that updates an rpc/rest endpoint can redirect trillions of URIs and exabytes of data instantly - no global DHT used for individual elements

When a key is rotated it doesn’t affect old content for it to be self-authenticating

Insight: names are most useful when in document URIs - not used to identify your personal finances publicly

just like we need IP over MAC addresses in order to have a hierarchy, for the same reason we need Headjack URIs on top of hashed data - the retrievability process is greatly improved

benefit: no need to store proofs for every single event as they can be derived

flexibility - addressing is forever - but the storage & architecture of any application can be changed - without breaking the addressing.

Farcaster focuses on eventual consistency with CRDTs & Delta Graphs but the elephant in the room is different counts based on different filters which cannot be done with CRDTs easily.
ACTUALLY not sure if that's true :|
but perhaps CRDTs are just not as performant for trillions of likes
Our view is that using CRDTs is a constraint - like for example multi-dimensional follows with include/exclude filtering
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#3-delta-graph

limits on data? size & retention?
CRDTs are a limit for Farcaster.
https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/tree/varunsrin/revise-v2-dec-4#33-bounding-graph-size
https://hackmd.io/fCa8_RCEQ4qBYZjfnas9Zg



partial view of the network allowed?
    not for farcaster

Why go theough the trouble of dealing with crdts and constrains if youll solve just one basic case and not everything thats possible?


They aim for Hubs to have a complete view of the network and are aiming for everything to fit in 64TB o_O

"we limit users to storing a finite number of deltas for each type and calculate the limits to keep the size of the graph under 64 TB."




farcaster is too constraining because of the use of CRDTs
The system cannot be extended by anyone because the Hubs need to agree to run the software that handles any new message type. The protocol is tied to the infra.


Farcaster: a lot of complexity, a lot of limitations and no clear path to being general purpose & web-scale




integer keys as opposed to hash-based keys - so that filtering is easy - by and/or-ing bitmaps
this goes in competition table!

hash-based intra-PDR addressing - could get very bloated

if a user's PDR goes away all cached documents are no longer linkable to their identity

- **Consortium** of nodes & a transparency log manage the DID registry.
    - Centralization point (not just [logical](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)) - users can be kicked off.
    - This should have been a credibly neutral & self-sustaining blockchain.

- Requires the use of keypairs which is worse UX compared to Headjack and would hinder mass adoption - although they do talk about [custodial solutions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/docs/#root-private-key-management).

- When users post content they update their Personal Data Repositories managed by their Personal Data Servers (PDS) which play somewhat similar roles to [Farcaster](#farcaster)'s managed hosts and Headjack's [IDMs](IDM.md).

- Users can lose their interest graph if the PDS they are using loses their data.

- The Personal Data Repositories would be a lot less compact than Headjack because accounts and links between them are not simple integers and every piece of data and relationship comes along with a signature.

Overall a solid effort and could work - some similarities to [Farcaster](#farcaster) but the DID registry is centralized by a consortium and the usernames are email-like (DNS - centralization point) instead of handled by the DID registry. Neither solution anchors content like Headjack does. -->

<p>Google is way more than just a search engine even though the majority of their revenue comes from advertising - they control large percentages of the plumbing of the web - key choke points such as submarine cables, routing, data centers, browsers, DNS, etc. <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidVorick"><code>David Vorick</code></a> puts this perfectly into perspective in <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-worrying-depth-and-scope-of-censorship-on-the-internet-ffd4bc5a5486"><code>The Worrying Depth and Scope of Censorship on the Internet</code></a> - some quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If Google decides they don’t like you, then for 65% of the world you simply stop existing. You have no recourse.
The terrifying thing about this is that Google is not an elected entity. Google has turned themselves into unelected regulators of the Internet, and they are held accountable only to their own share price.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As our economy and services become more deeply intertwined, an increasing number of players have more influence and ability to de-platform a greater number of businesses and users. And these requirements compound against each other. If one service provider is particularly opinionated and quick to de-platform, everybody else is forced to give them a large amount of breathing room and become more oppressive towards their users to avoid potential conflict.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This does not scale. The end result will be a global monoculture where everybody is afraid to take risks or break the status quo because nobody can afford to upset even a single of the hundreds of services that they depend on. Our culture gets established and defined by giants like Facebook and Google rather than users and creators, because only Facebook and Google have the resources to bully everyone else into allowing changes to happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The only way to avoid this endgame is to demand infrastructure that remains neutral. At the scale of today’s Internet and global economy, infrastructure that does not remain neutral will inevitably turn on its users and coerce them into a set of moral standards that are both arbitrary and enforced without consent.&quot;</p>

sitemaps are also not necessary - they are used to inform crawlers when specific pages were last updated &amp; how often they change, but that's obsolete in a push environment
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps
EDIT: actually sitemaps are only partially outdated - what about pages that are not reachable at all? that's when sitemaps are also useful - to explicitly mention them</p>
<p>for search engines to rank modern dynamic &amp; single page apps they need to render them server-side - this can be skipped if data is decoupled from presentation and if the ranking engine is simply listening for document updates. They also currently cache the entire pages - just like an archival service. Massive benefits in a push vs a pull system for crawlers &amp; indexers</p>

<p>Frontend code served by applications can be published and have its own URI. Updates to it would happen by broadcasting the next version along with a new URI and then pointing on-chain to it as the latest to use for viewing media. This way presentation layers could be cached locally and in a distributed way with proofs for authenticity - improving redundancy, latency, and throughput. Checking for a newer version would be a small query to the chain if there is a new URI - version control for frontends. This can work even for more dynamic applications that serve different versions depending on region/locale or which are A/B testing - the dynamic part could be served from a centralized host while smaller chunks of code could be referenced through URIs.</p>

<p>We'll be able to computationally verify the authenticity of any document &amp; tie it to an identity as long as we also have the proofs for it - giving birth to the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a> where argument from cryptography begins superseding argument from authority.</p>
<p>Anyone might have saved a specific document (&amp; updates to it) locally along with the necessary proofs for authenticity even if most infrastructure no longer stores/serves it. There is a <code>1 of N</code> guarantee which allows documents that someone wants buried to be passed around with proofs and resurface in the public at a later point - improving accountability.</p>
<!-- 
TODO:
In such an environment controversial and false claims are much easier to prove.
If even intranets and corps move to this addressing then whistpeblowing will be much more authentic. This is the mechanism for the biggest crimes to bubble up

The ability to do specific verifiable attribution to where a harm is coming from can increase our capacity to serve justice

We could establish global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) through authenticity, reputation, and the ledger of record.

Another important aspect in improving coordination is to build applications that will help in forming common knowledge:

"The great privilege of the elites of the future will be to erase the computer information about them and assume their private identity again." - Marshall McLuhan

> "Common knowledge is often important for coordination. For example, a group of people might want to speak out about an issue, but only feel comfortable doing so if there’s enough of them speaking out at the same time that they have safety in numbers." [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html)


no mentioned "fact" shall remain unanchored/unreferenced - that's what stable URIs and intra-document addressing are for

<p>Headjack is a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control system</a> with different data availability tradeoffs - storage and retrievability are not guaranteed. If someone processes everything that's linked to the blockchain they'd be able to track the creation and changes of each document - both the edits from the original authors and the forks &amp; references from others, and also the sequence of authorizations that update who has authority to edit a document. All events are cryptographically sealed in time with on-chain commitments and the history cannot be tampered with.</p>
<p>We should be able to view the changes of any document with a diff view - similarly to what <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/">The Internet Archive provides</a> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches">this as an example</a>) but with a lot more control and a wide range of different visualization tools - example: a slider for filtering/jumping through time <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096">like in Discourse</a>.</p>

<h1 id="deduplicating-documents--traceability"><a class="header" href="#deduplicating-documents--traceability">Deduplicating documents &amp; traceability</a></h1>
<p>An open paradigm with content addressing where data is shared between services would enable us to de-duplicate re-uploads as long as they are the same documents in terms of bytes because of the open nature of data - based on their hash. We'll be able to see when something first appeared &amp; the discussion will be much less fractured between platforms and posts - leading to greater depth.</p>
<p>We'll be able to more easily <a href="names_and_paths.html#addressing-within-content">address parts of documents</a> and share ranges of entire videos without having to re-upload them as separate clips which breaks the contextual link. If this becomes as easy as (or even easier than) it currently is to crop &amp; re-upload, then it will become the norm - we'll all prefer not losing the context. In this paradigm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfakes</a> will be easier to spot &amp; fight - tracing the source of content authentically to identity is important &amp; desirable.</p>

<h1 id="verifiable-credentials"><a class="header" href="#verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a></h1>
<p>Entities can sign messages that attest facts about other accounts - the creation of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a> doesn't have to happen on-chain - they can be issued off-chain with a message that's only anchored on-chain and has a URI. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html#modifying-and-revoking-attestations"><code>&quot;issuance is common, revocation is rare&quot;</code></a> - later revocations &amp; updates can be handled in one of 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-chain revocation/updates: if the attestations are uniquely numbered with a counter from the issuer using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">nonce</a>, then the Headjack state can be extended to support a special <code>revocation list</code> field in which the chain can record revocations at specific blocks - then the validity of said attestations will be checkable with a single query to the blockchain state. For updates there would be a second list and in order to check the validity for an attestation after an update has been recorded for its nonce, users would need to fetch the off-chain anchored message corresponding to the update at the block at which it was flagged. The blockchain may charge periodic fees for state rent for these lists.</li>
<li>Fully off-chain: in which case there will be some liveness assumptions around the issuer for checking if an attestation has been revoked/updated.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We don't need oracles, tokens, automatic on-chain settlement &amp; markets through smart contracts to build reputation systems for predictions &amp; promises - all we need is to immutably sequence predictive messages that are authentically linked to identity and plot the results - the open nature of the data would disincentivize platforms to display it incorrectly which is enough - we trust block explorers after all.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/">Tipranks</a> platform as an example - we can generalize it for anyone in the world - not just for certified financial advisors. The reality is that millions of people are effectively guilty of shilling, despite some preficing it with the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1552968186605490176"><code>&quot;this is not financial advice&quot;</code></a>. We can self-regulate the crypto &amp; financial industries bottom-up in a decentralized way - steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>come up with the base set of extensible prediction message types</li>
<li>build the tools that plot predictions versus a price feed</li>
<li>demand that influencers use the specific types of messages for predictions</li>
<li>refuse to listen to accounts that don't use that format and build the habit to check track records before listening to someone - this can (and will) become a social norm</li>
<li>let the <a href="https://twitter.com/TSLAgang/status/1433896307702353921">chips fall where they may</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have &quot;fallback&quot; translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don't support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema <code>42</code> can have the following template for serialization: <code>&quot;{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}&quot;</code>, and thus a basic application that encounters <code>{message_type: &quot;42&quot;, asset: &quot;$BTC&quot;, date: &quot;2025.02.12&quot;, above_or_below: &quot;above&quot;, price: &quot;100000$&quot;, probability: &quot;80%&quot;}</code> could render <code>&quot;$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12&quot;</code>. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there's no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.</p>
<p>The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.</p>
<!-- Perhaps the reputation system can be abused - by making 100 accounts and building different prediction timelines throughout time and then using only the winners - this page should be treated just as a starting point and isn't trying to provide all the answers. -->

<p>&quot;Finally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust.

The transparency provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced.

<p>the semantic web was held back by the host-centric model and the lack of stable decentralized identities to which we could link/join data</p>
<p>reviving the semantic web</p>
<p>example: schema.org and their &quot;identifiers&quot; for relationships:
https://schema.org/knows
but this could be just 2 numbers: 1234:651</p>
<p>Episodes &amp; other creations should get their concept id</p>
<p>The RDF format &amp; the use of URIs means that most keys are long strings beholden to the host-centric model</p>
<p>we should be able to react to RDF triples that assert something</p>

<p>Ontologies are a formal way to describe taxonomies and classification networks, essentially defining the structure of knowledge for various domains: the nouns representing classes of objects and the verbs representing relations between the objects.</p>
<p>Due to the scale-free effect there will be a power law distribution for the IDs being used - there will be a convergence - just like imdb movie ids are used in many places</p>
<p>There will be SQL interfaces on top of all of the data</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network</p>
<p>concepts! not nouns
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept</p>
<p>open graph protocol is an extremely simple ontology for semantic data
The embedded facebook like button in external pages makes use of OGP and is the largest generator of RDF triplets out there. The more you've annotated the content - the easier it is for Facebook to make sense of the data.
There's a difference from &quot;they liked something on that page&quot; from &quot;they liked this specific shoe from a store sold by X&quot;
With OGP, only entities like Facebook and the website owner get the structured data - with Headjack such public actions could be available for anyone to use - we'd get a lot more innovation &amp; experimentation in algorithms that make use of the public data</p>
<p>The semantic web on top of extremely long &amp; verbose host-centric URIs was bad</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The more you enter, the more you become locked in. Your social-networking site becomes a central platform - a closed silo of content, and one that does not give you full control over your information in it. The more this kind of architecture gains widespread use, the more the Web becomes fragmented, and the less we enjoy a single, universal information space.&quot; - <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1269744">Tim Berners-Lee</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Convenience &amp; network effects have lead to extreme levels of centralization of identity in just a few players with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a> (SSO) functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As of 2018 the consolidation of power and control over the social web by a few large corporations seems unparalleled&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">Decentralizing the Social Web</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin">Harry Halpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But despite the concentration of SSO services a lot of identity-related data is fragmented between many more websites due to the lack of standards, interoperability &amp; incentives: content, profiles, settings/preferences, social graph, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1524886818725847040">direct messages</a>, bookmarks, playlists, progress bars, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3#:~:text=Identity%20on%20the,that%20something%20changes.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the individual services are often extremely limiting - people have resorted to making Twitter threads with links to other of their threads and they pin that master thread to their profiles.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>All this has lead to the rise of apps like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree">Linktree</a> (a single page where you can display a number of links and conveniently point to it from all other websites - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/">valued at 1.3B$ at one point?!</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/TextsHQ">Texts</a> (which aims to be a single messenger client that aggregates all others) and many more social media aggregators (such as a single interface to streamline posting content on multiple platforms at once) but they will always be at the mercy of the terms of service &amp; APIs of the platforms they're wrapping and are all just a bandaid for today’s fragmentation of identity - they are a symptom.</p>

<p>In order to reconstruct we must first deconstruct. What types of actions &amp; events result in our trail of data? What are the building blocks? Here's a rough scetch of a few broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authoring documents &amp; events</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posts &amp; documents</strong> (sharing/retweeting are a type of post too)</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - on posts/documents and other comments</li>
<li><strong>Reactions</strong> - to posts/documents/comments</li>
<li><strong>Other</strong> - playlists, issuing credentials/attestations/certificates, RSVPs for events, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - information such as bio, profile picture, link to website &amp; linktree, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Social graph</strong> (or interest graph) - your connections &amp; subscriptions</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong> (+ browser extensions)
<ul>
<li><strong>Cosmetic</strong> (UI) - colors, layout, hiding the &quot;recommended videos&quot; panel in YouTube with the <code>&quot;DF Tube - Distraction Free for YouTube&quot;</code> browser extension, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Functional</strong> - filters, blocked accounts, topics of interest for the feed, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> of what's been viewed/visited - 2 types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser</strong> history (can be synced across devices with cloud accounts)</li>
<li><strong>App-specific</strong> history (YouTube has a watched videos list but Twitter has no such thing)
<ul>
<li>playback progress is a special type of app-specific history - YouTube &amp; Spotify store &amp; show it for any item (but not which parts of the timeline have been viewed (like a barcode) - and thus moving the playback cursor changes your &quot;progress&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong>: browser &amp; app-specific (Twitter) - wildly inferior to specialized note-taking apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we've omitted things such as edits, DMs, &amp; others. Today we're left with only what product managers in Big Tech have decided is worthwhile for them to implement. For example we're unable to react or comment on the reaction of someone else. Does it always make sense to do so? No, but it should be possible. We're limited to the lowest common denominator of functionality and the APIs used by third party companies to extend the platforms come with very restrictive terms of service &amp; limitations and can change at any point in time - killing entire ecosystems.</p>

<p>What if we could choose the visibility of any action? We could set different defaults for any of them, have the ability to override it for any individual item and even have an account-wide visibility toggle between public &amp; private - similar to when you open an incognito browser window and (hopefully) not have any of your history recorded &amp; correlated with your identity. This might not always be a good idea (users might mess up and make something public by accident), but it should be possible and we have already learned using incognito windows as a pattern - such shifts are possible.</p>
<p>But why would we want this flexibility? A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong>: individuals &amp; streamers who are digging into something might want to make their digital trail for a browsing session public &amp; more easily accessible, analyzable &amp; followable.</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could &quot;follow&quot; those of others - adopting changes automatically. </li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could aggregate and analyze the shifts in public preferences throughout time - enabling better and more organic discoverability of tools and settings.</li>
<li>Both <strong>history</strong> and <strong>settings &amp; preferences</strong> can be shared not just publicly but also selectively with entities so that we can monetize our own data. Currently our behavioral patterns are closed &amp; being data mined by companies which make decisions in their own best interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The freedom to share is a form of expression and agency - we should have granular control. A key piece of the puzzle is moving away from the host-centric web by linking data to identity so that it can be seamlessly exported and addressed across services in a uniform way.</p>
<p>The following chapters will show why this is so important to be able to show &amp; signal your settings &amp; preferences.</p>
<!-- For the fully private actions there is a 3rd axis - local or in the cloud, but we won't look into that here. -->
<h1 id="connections-follows--multidimensionality"><a class="header" href="#connections-follows--multidimensionality">Connections, follows &amp; multidimensionality</a></h1>
<p>Today's form of relationships in social media are too simplistic - you either follow someone or you don't. Apps like Instagram don't even have the distinction between a connection (friendship) and a follow - you can't have access to someone's private photos without also following them (at least Facebook has this distinction). This is by design - the less control you have over what activity ends up in your feed - the more engaging the app and the better for them. They're also leveraging social pressure by showing explicitly if someone is following you: <code>&quot;How come you're not following me?&quot;</code> - you can't have a private follow in Instagram and that's on purpose (at least you can in Facebook). YouTube subscriptions became a mere hint to the recommendation algorithm over time because the platform &quot;knows better&quot; what's good for you and how your attention should be spent - that's why creators always say to <code>&quot;hit the bell icon&quot;</code> - a harder &amp; more explicit form of subscription.</p>
<p>We are complex beings with different interests &amp; aspects to our personalities - that's why there are many many apps to address different needs &amp; verticals: Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Medium, Quora, StackExchange, etc. We are multidimensional:</p>
<!-- FIXME: edit picture to add text -->
<img src="images/multidimensionality_cropped.png">
<p>Even Substack is transitioning to <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-notes">something like Twitter</a> but it is built around email for accounts - we can do better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Social networks do best when they tap into one of the seven deadly sins. Facebook is ego. Zynga is sloth. LinkedIn is greed.&quot; - <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/134480">Reid Hoffman</a>, LinkedIn founder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! A single identity network is all 8 at the same time.</p>
<p>But that comes at a cost: fragmented &amp; inconsistent identity, content duplication, &amp; lack of composability to name a few. What if everything was built on top of a single unified identity network shared and reused across apps with granular subscriptions (following) for what we want to be notified for and see from others in our feeds (+ the ability to control the visibility of any action)?</p>
<h1 id="event-streams-subscriptions--notifications"><a class="header" href="#event-streams-subscriptions--notifications">Event streams, subscriptions &amp; notifications</a></h1>
<p>In the the ultimate subscription network you'd be able to listen for and filter events based on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application source</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>everything</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>coming from</code><em><strong><code>app B</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><strong>Content/event type</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>all pictures</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>all subscription events</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labels &amp; tags</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>all financial advice</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><strong>Severity &amp; importance</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>every alert/warning/importance&gt;5</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><strong>Custom filters &amp; rules</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>any mention/reference of X</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>account A</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li>Subscriptions not tied to accounts
<ul>
<li><strong>document</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>all changes</code></strong></em><code>to</code><em><strong><code>playlist P</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><strong>general</strong> - <code>&quot;I want </code><em><strong><code>any mention of $ETH</code></strong></em><code>from</code><em><strong><code>anywhere</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exclusion</strong> - any filter from above can also be inverted and layered with an inclusive one
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;</code><em><strong><code>exclude pictures</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code> / <code>&quot;</code><em><strong><code>exclude app B</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code> / <code>&quot;</code><em><strong><code>exclude edits to P</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code></li>
<li>This might prove to be the most used form of filters - subscribe to everything from some entity initially and then gradually exclude sources &amp; events you aren't interested in - this way you'd get by default all new types of events that start to be generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In an open &amp; interoperable data environment anything could become an event stream as long as someone is willing to pay for the processing costs (filtration, transformation, storage &amp; bandwidth) - we could construct any kind of stream by transforming &amp; joining others - similar to Kafka. If someone starts transcribing audio episodes with speech-to-text (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">whisper</a>?) and publishing the output by referencing the original item it would immediately become available to anyone and could automatically end up being parsed, indexed &amp; pushed through data pipelines. <strong>Composability</strong>.</p>
<p>These information channels could be bundled together in different sets &amp; event streams which can then be used in separate scrollable feeds &amp; notification folders with different settings and meaning to us. We can explicitly compartmentalize our attention budget in different buckets. Perhaps it's not straightforward to offer all this with an easy &amp; intuitive UX, but we haven't even tried! There's always the option to offer limited functionality by default with everything advanced hidden behind a menu.</p>
<p>TODO: how could us seeing what others are subscribing us for about change what we produce? a sophisticated form of audience capture?</p>
<p>This isn't a new idea - the open nature of RSS has enabled readers (software clients) to offer users the ability to construct rules for subcriptions and manage them in folders. A little known fact is that YouTube channels have RSS feeds. If you subscribed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnchainedPodcast">@UnchainedPodcast</a> (this is their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWiiMnsnw5Isc2PP1to9nNw">RSS feed</a>) with an RSS reader you might have noticed that <code>#shorts</code> are given to you along with normal videos. <a href="https://inoreader.com/">InoReader</a> allows you with a paid feature to construct custom rules such as <code>&quot;</code><em><strong><code>mark as read anything</code></strong></em><code>that</code><em><strong><code>contains</code></strong></em><code>the string</code><em><strong><code>#shorts</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code>. We can have this, but completely generalized!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Notifications are just alarm clocks that someone else is setting for you.&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1012389905840816133">@naval</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter decided at some point to boost engagement and forced <code>&quot;recent tweet&quot;</code> notifications down our throats <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qwvhhb/how_do_you_disable_recent_tweets_from_x/">with no ability to turn them off</a>. Instagram sometimes changes the notifications button indicating something new when in fact there's nothing - we're being conditioned like rats through regular pokes &amp; dopamine hits. Such things should never be out of our explicit control.</p>
<p>When identity is decoupled from the presentation layer (applications) we could have IDMs that align with our needs - we could fine-tune how and when we want to be notified (for example only in specific time ranges of the day). IDMs can monetize us in ways other than advertising and their incentives won't be to suck all of our attention - as opposed to applications that usually serve ads.</p>
<!-- Our minds filter out inconsequential sensations by default but we may tune them in with focus - we should have even greater levels of control in the digital realm. The stream of events for whatever we are interested in needs the most sophisticated filtering and configuration possible and anyone should be able to plug into the global event bus and develop new tools. -->

<p>Let's contrast <a href="digital_footprint.html#today-centralized--fragmented-identity">today's world of centralized &amp; fragmented identity</a> to a world with a single shared identity network with interoperable &amp; exportable data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each time we go from one social network to another we do not need to restate who we are, what our interests are, or who we know&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">Decentralizing the Social Web</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin">Harry Halpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's just scratching the surface - how much further could we push things? Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>single place for all your messages</strong> (DMs &amp; email) - similar to <a href="https://texts.com/">Texts</a> (<code>&quot;All of your messages in one inbox&quot;</code>) but not beholden to the terms of service &amp; constraining APIs of platforms.
<ul>
<li><strong>Define filters &amp; thresholds for cold DMs</strong> - have separate inboxes based on properties: account older than 2 years? has credential X? up to 3 degrees of separation from you? amount paid to contact you? (setting a price for yourself), etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Universal bookmarks</strong> - they'll work for any type of document/event from any app and you could even cache the actual content that a URI points to along with proofs - forever.
<ul>
<li><strong>Partial selections</strong> - select a paragraph/sentence or range on a timeline (a clip) and save it - the URI for the underlying document is stable.</li>
<li><strong>Playlists</strong> are lists of bookmarks and could work even with different audio/video apps which have given URIs to tracks. Spotify could be just an app that uses your IDM for account storage (managing your library &amp; tracking your progress on podcasts) and is paying hosting providers for storage &amp; bandwidth for streaming.</li>
<li>Your <strong>personal knowledge base</strong> could be built with something like <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> on top of such universal bookmarks along with personal notes - your second brain. Looking up anything related to an identity or a document with a URI would be just 1 click away - seamlessly integrated in the UI.</li>
<li><strong>Browser integration</strong> - using any IDM for cloud sync through a standard interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Profile presets</strong> - different versions of what to display depending on the context:
<ul>
<li><strong>Full profile</strong> - a MySpace/Linktree-like page with everything you'd like to show + a log of all your public activity of any kind across any app/service - similar to the <code>Replies</code> tab of an account in Twitter, but with everything (changes, edits, commits) and the ability to filter it.</li>
<li><strong>Context-dependent views</strong> for domain-specific apps - those that deal mostly with images could display the relevant subset of your full profile: pictures &amp; a log of events related only to images. Apps geared towards professional work &amp; resumes could display your CV and a list of credentials &amp; attestations. This can happen either by explicitly defining subsets of attributes as different presets or automatically by the apps through filtering based on type/tag. One could always view the full profile of someone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History of viewed documents</strong> - a list of URIs in your cloud for everything you've seen.
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter out seen content</strong> - hide items that you've already looked at from feeds.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline intervals</strong> for audio &amp; video playback - saving ranges for any part of the timeline that you've played for longer than X seconds. Today YouTube &amp; Spotify save merely the progress as a position which can easily be changed/lost by fast-forwarding the cursor.</li>
<li><strong>Display seen content differently</strong> - with colors or show progress as percentage/time.
<ul>
<li><strong>Progress for text documents</strong> - record time spent &amp; sections rendered on screen and be able to toggle a heatmap overlay that colors the text accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define your <strong>home page</strong> - shortcuts, dashboards, folders &amp; widgets with a customizable layout - anything you need. But more on that in the superapp section of this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this would be easiest to build around a single unified identity network with data interoperability.</p>

When you show your Attention (what algorithms, apps & settings you're using, & even your history) you get attention for it - in regards to the signaling

the level of sophistication in email filtering (in gmail for example) should be matched by any social media. But the incentives of social media is to engage you - not help you be less engaged or more meaningfully engaged

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The more you enter, the more you become locked in. Your social-networking site becomes a central platform - a closed silo of content, and one that does not give you full control over your information in it. The more this kind of architecture gains widespread use, the more the Web becomes fragmented, and the less we enjoy a single, universal information space.&quot; - <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/1269744">Tim Berners-Lee</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Convenience &amp; network effects have lead to extreme levels of centralization of identity in just a few players with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a> (SSO) functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As of 2018 the consolidation of power and control over the social web by a few large corporations seems unparalleled&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">Decentralizing the Social Web</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin">Harry Halpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But despite the concentration of SSO services a lot of identity-related data is fragmented between many more websites due to the lack of standards, interoperability &amp; incentives: content, profiles, settings/preferences, social graph, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1524886818725847040">direct messages</a>, bookmarks, playlists, progress bars, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Identity on the internet today is fragmented across many centralized services, each with its own set of user data. Signing up for a new service requires making a brand new identity and re-entering all of your information. This is not only tedious but also means that a user’s identity is going to be inconsistent between services because they are not always going to update key information on every single service every time that something changes.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/skyid-how-to-make-decentralized-identity-using-skynet-2b282682f5b3#:~:text=Identity%20on%20the,that%20something%20changes.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the individual services are often extremely limiting - people have resorted to making Twitter threads with links to other of their threads and they pin that master thread to their profiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Twitter product request: a custom tab on my profile page i can pin my top 25 tweets — perhaps label it “best of <a href="https://twitter.com/Jason">@jason</a>”&quot; - <a href="https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1636464901911904257">Jason Calacanis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All this has lead to the rise of apps like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linktree">Linktree</a> (a single page where you can display a number of links and conveniently point to it from all other websites - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/16/linktree-link-in-bio-series-c-valuation/">valued at 1.3B$ at one point?!</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/TextsHQ">Texts</a> (which aims to be a single messenger client that aggregates all others) and many more social media aggregators (such as a single interface to streamline posting content on multiple platforms at once) but they will always be at the mercy of the terms of service &amp; APIs of the platforms they're wrapping and are all just a bandaid for today’s fragmentation of identity - they are a symptom.</p>

<p>In order to reconstruct we must first deconstruct. What types of actions &amp; events result in our trail of data? What are the building blocks? Here's a rough scetch of a few broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authoring documents &amp; events</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Posts &amp; documents</strong> (sharing/retweeting are a type of post too)</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - on posts/documents and other comments</li>
<li><strong>Reactions</strong> - to posts/documents/comments</li>
<li><strong>Other</strong> - playlists, issuing credentials/attestations/certificates, RSVPs for events, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - information such as bio, profile picture, link to website &amp; linktree, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Social graph</strong> (or interest graph) - your connections &amp; subscriptions</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong> (+ browser extensions)
<ul>
<li><strong>Cosmetic</strong> (UI) - colors, layout, hiding the &quot;recommended videos&quot; panel in YouTube with the <code>&quot;DF Tube - Distraction Free for YouTube&quot;</code> browser extension, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Functional</strong> - filters, blocked accounts, topics of interest for the feed, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History</strong> of what's been viewed/visited - 2 types:
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser</strong> history (can be synced across devices with cloud accounts)</li>
<li><strong>App-specific</strong> history (YouTube has a watched videos list but Twitter has no such thing)
<ul>
<li>playback progress is a special type of app-specific history - YouTube &amp; Spotify store &amp; show it for any item (but not which parts of the timeline have been viewed (like a barcode) - and thus moving the playback cursor changes your &quot;progress&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bookmarks</strong>: browser &amp; app-specific (Twitter) - wildly inferior to specialized note-taking apps</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we've omitted things such as edits, DMs, &amp; others. Today we're left with only what product managers in Big Tech have decided is worthwhile for them to implement. For example we're unable to react or comment on the reaction of someone else. Does it always make sense to do so? No, but it should be possible. We're limited to the lowest common denominator of functionality and the APIs used by third party companies to extend the platforms come with very restrictive terms of service &amp; limitations and can change at any point in time - killing entire ecosystems.</p>

<p>What if we could choose the visibility of any action? We could set different defaults for any of them, have the ability to override it for any individual item and even have an account-wide visibility toggle between public &amp; private - similar to when you open an incognito browser window and (hopefully) not have any of your history recorded &amp; correlated with your identity. This might not always be a good idea (users might mess up and make something public by accident), but it should be possible and we have already learned using incognito windows as a pattern - such shifts are possible.</p>
<p>But why would we want this flexibility? A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History</strong>: individuals &amp; streamers who are digging into something might want to make their digital trail for a browsing session public &amp; more easily accessible, analyzable &amp; followable.</li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could &quot;follow&quot; those of others - adopting changes automatically. </li>
<li><strong>Settings &amp; preferences</strong>: we could aggregate and analyze the shifts in public preferences throughout time - enabling better and more organic discoverability of tools and settings.</li>
<li>Both <strong>history</strong> and <strong>settings &amp; preferences</strong> can be shared not just publicly but also selectively with entities so that we can monetize our own data. Currently our behavioral patterns are closed &amp; being data mined by companies which make decisions in their own best interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The freedom to share is a form of expression and agency - we should have granular control. A key piece of the puzzle is moving away from the host-centric web by linking data to identity so that it can be seamlessly exported and addressed across services in a uniform way.</p>
<p>The following chapters will show why this is so important to be able to show &amp; signal your settings &amp; preferences.</p>
<!-- For the fully private actions there is a 3rd axis - local or in the cloud, but we won't look into that here. -->
<h1 id="connections-follows--multidimensionality-1"><a class="header" href="#connections-follows--multidimensionality-1">Connections, follows &amp; multidimensionality</a></h1>
<p>Today's form of relationships in social media are too simplistic - you either follow someone or you don't. Apps like Instagram don't even have the distinction between a connection (friendship) and a follow - you can't have access to someone's private photos without also following them (at least Facebook has this distinction). This is by design - the less control you have over what activity ends up in your feed - the more engaging the app and the better for them. They're also leveraging social pressure by showing explicitly if someone is following you: <code>&quot;How come you're not following me?&quot;</code> - you can't have a private follow in Instagram and that's on purpose (at least you can in Facebook). YouTube subscriptions became a mere hint to the recommendation algorithm over time because the platform &quot;knows better&quot; what's good for you and how your attention should be spent - that's why creators always say to <code>&quot;hit the bell icon&quot;</code> - a harder &amp; more explicit form of subscription.</p>
<p>We are complex beings with different interests &amp; aspects to our personalities - that's why there are many many apps to address different needs &amp; verticals: Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Medium, Quora, StackExchange, etc. We are multidimensional:</p>
<!-- FIXME: edit picture to add text -->
<img src="images/multidimensionality_cropped.png">
<p>Even Substack is transitioning to <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/introducing-notes">something like Twitter</a> but it is built around email for accounts - we can do better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Social networks do best when they tap into one of the seven deadly sins. Facebook is ego. Zynga is sloth. LinkedIn is greed.&quot; - <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/134480">Reid Hoffman</a>, LinkedIn founder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! A single identity network is all 8 at the same time.</p>
<p>But that comes at a cost: fragmented &amp; inconsistent identity, content duplication, &amp; lack of composability to name a few. What if everything was built on top of a single unified identity network shared and reused across apps with granular subscriptions (following) for what we want to be notified for and see from others in our feeds (+ the ability to control the visibility of any action)?</p>

<p>In the the ultimate subscription network you'd be able to listen for and filter events based on:</p>
<ul>

<li>This might prove to be the most used form of filters - subscribe to everything from some entity initially and then gradually exclude sources &amp; events you aren't interested in - this way you'd get by default all new types of events that start to be generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In an open &amp; interoperable data environment anything could become an event stream as long as someone is willing to pay for the processing costs (filtration, transformation, storage &amp; bandwidth) - we could construct any kind of stream by transforming &amp; joining others - similar to Kafka. If someone starts transcribing audio episodes with speech-to-text (<a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">whisper</a>?) and publishing the output by referencing the original item it would immediately become available to anyone and could automatically end up being parsed, indexed &amp; pushed through data pipelines. <strong>Composability</strong>.</p>
<p>These information channels could be bundled together in different sets &amp; event streams which can then be used in separate scrollable feeds &amp; notification folders with different settings and meaning to us. We can explicitly compartmentalize our attention budget in different buckets. Perhaps it's not straightforward to offer all this with an easy &amp; intuitive UX, but we haven't even tried! There's always the option to offer limited functionality by default with everything advanced hidden behind a menu.</p>
<p>TODO: how could us seeing what others are subscribing us for about change what we produce? a sophisticated form of audience capture?</p>
<p>This isn't a new idea - the open nature of RSS has enabled readers (software clients) to offer users the ability to construct rules for subcriptions and manage them in folders. A little known fact is that YouTube channels have RSS feeds. If you subscribed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnchainedPodcast">@UnchainedPodcast</a> (this is their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWiiMnsnw5Isc2PP1to9nNw">RSS feed</a>) with an RSS reader you might have noticed that <code>#shorts</code> are given to you along with normal videos. <a href="https://inoreader.com/">InoReader</a> allows you with a paid feature to construct custom rules such as <code>&quot;</code><em><strong><code>mark as read anything</code></strong></em><code>that</code><em><strong><code>contains</code></strong></em><code>the string</code><em><strong><code>#shorts</code></strong></em><code>&quot;</code>. We can have this, but completely generalized!</p>

<p>Twitter decided at some point to boost engagement and forced <code>&quot;recent tweet&quot;</code> notifications down our throats <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qwvhhb/how_do_you_disable_recent_tweets_from_x/">with no ability to turn them off</a>. Instagram sometimes changes the notifications button indicating something new when in fact there's nothing - we're being conditioned like rats through regular pokes &amp; dopamine hits. Such things should never be out of our explicit control.</p>
<p>When identity is decoupled from the presentation layer (applications) we could have IDMs that align with our needs - we could fine-tune how and when we want to be notified (for example only in specific time ranges of the day). IDMs can monetize us in ways other than advertising and their incentives won't be to suck all of our attention - as opposed to applications that usually serve ads.</p>
<!-- Our minds filter out inconsequential sensations by default but we may tune them in with focus - we should have even greater levels of control in the digital realm. The stream of events for whatever we are interested in needs the most sophisticated filtering and configuration possible and anyone should be able to plug into the global event bus and develop new tools. -->

<p>Let's contrast <a href="digital_footprint.html#today-centralized--fragmented-identity">today's world of centralized &amp; fragmented identity</a> to a world with a single shared identity network with interoperable &amp; exportable data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each time we go from one social network to another we do not need to restate who we are, what our interests are, or who we know&quot; - <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01966561/document">Decentralizing the Social Web</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin">Harry Halpin</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's just scratching the surface - how much further could we push things? Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>single place for all your messages</strong> (DMs &amp; email) - similar to <a href="https://texts.com/">Texts</a> (<code>&quot;All of your messages in one inbox&quot;</code>) but not beholden to the terms of service &amp; constraining APIs of platforms.
<ul>
<li><strong>Define filters &amp; thresholds for cold DMs</strong> - have separate inboxes based on properties: account older than 2 years? has credential X? up to 3 degrees of separation from you? amount paid to contact you? (setting a price for yourself), etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Universal bookmarks</strong> - they'll work for any type of document/event from any app and you could even cache the actual content that a URI points to along with proofs - forever.
<ul>
<li><strong>Partial selections</strong> - select a paragraph/sentence or range on a timeline (a clip) and save it - the URI for the underlying document is stable.</li>
<li><strong>Playlists</strong> are lists of bookmarks and could work even with different audio/video apps which have given URIs to tracks. Spotify could be just an app that uses your IDM for account storage (managing your library &amp; tracking your progress on podcasts) and is paying hosting providers for storage &amp; bandwidth for streaming.</li>
<li>Your <strong>personal knowledge base</strong> could be built with something like <a href="https://logseq.com/">Logseq</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a> on top of such universal bookmarks along with personal notes - your second brain. Looking up anything related to an identity or a document with a URI would be just 1 click away - seamlessly integrated in the UI.</li>
<li><strong>Browser integration</strong> - using any IDM for cloud sync through a standard interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Profile presets</strong> - different versions of what to display depending on the context:
<ul>
<li><strong>Full profile</strong> - a MySpace/Linktree-like page with everything you'd like to show + a log of all your public activity of any kind across any app/service - similar to the <code>Replies</code> tab of an account in Twitter, but with everything (changes, edits, commits) and the ability to filter it.</li>
<li><strong>Context-dependent views</strong> for domain-specific apps - those that deal mostly with images could display the relevant subset of your full profile: pictures &amp; a log of events related only to images. Apps geared towards professional work &amp; resumes could display your CV and a list of credentials &amp; attestations. This can happen either by explicitly defining subsets of attributes as different presets or automatically by the apps through filtering based on type/tag. One could always view the full profile of someone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>History of viewed documents</strong> - a list of URIs in your cloud for everything you've seen.
<ul>
<li><strong>Filter out seen content</strong> - hide items that you've already looked at from feeds.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline intervals</strong> for audio &amp; video playback - saving ranges for any part of the timeline that you've played for longer than X seconds. Today YouTube &amp; Spotify save merely the progress as a position which can easily be changed/lost by fast-forwarding the cursor.</li>
<li><strong>Display seen content differently</strong> - with colors or show progress as percentage/time.
<ul>
<li><strong>Progress for text documents</strong> - record time spent &amp; sections rendered on screen and be able to toggle a heatmap overlay that colors the text accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define your <strong>home page</strong> - shortcuts, dashboards, folders &amp; widgets with a customizable layout - anything you need. But more on that in the superapp section of this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this would be easiest to build around a single unified identity network with data interoperability.</p>

<p>One of the most transformative (pun intended) papers in AI/ML is called ...</p>
<p>The importance of attention cannot be overstated</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. Why those resources are limited and how they can best be controlled will vary across use cases, but the ability to dynamically alter and route the flow of information has clear benefits for the adaptiveness of any system.&quot; - <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#:~:text=Attention%20is%20the%20flexible%20control%20of%20limited%20computational%20resources.%20Why%20those%20resources%20are%20limited%20and%20how%20they%20can%20best%20be%20controlled%20will%20vary%20across%20use%20cases%2C%20but%20the%20ability%20to%20dynamically%20alter%20and%20route%20the%20flow%20of%20information%20has%20clear%20benefits%20for%20the%20adaptiveness%20of%20any%20system.">Attention in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Machine Learning</a></p>

<p>Facebook is a government with a monopoly not on violence but on attention and they are unaccountable to anyone for who or what they put in attention jail</p>
<p>Our attentional arteries
the view from above - as earth during night - lit up with electricity and glowing as the nervous system</p>
<p>Predatory tactics: inserting irrelevant entries along with search results with the aim of engagement</p>
<p>Attention has a cost - an opportunity cost. It is a resource and hence we &quot;pay&quot; attention
It also takes energy to process information and energy is just a resource as well</p>
<p>awareness is a model of attention - when someone is aware of something we're sketching a model of their attention and where it's currently directed
But are we collectively aware? Do we know where our attention is directed and can we control how it is directed? No.
Neuroscience tells us that the brain builds models - for the world and for itself - using information and signals. They are always inaccurate and never perfect - efficient, but quick and dirty.
The phantom limb sensation is when the model is still operating according to the past - but the limb no longer exists. We still register the physical limb as present.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb</p>
<p>Humanity lacks a cohesive subjective awareness as a schematic model of itself - we lack an attention schema. We can't:</p>
<ul>
<li>control our attention</li>
<li>model the attention of others and different groups of people</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Awareness is the brain's way of describing to itself what it means to focus attention on something.&quot; - <a href="https://youtu.be/H8twgvcA-Ko?t=349">Michael Graziano</a>
combining the capacity to build models and pay attention.</p>

<p>Reclaiming and directing attention</p>
<p>we are the agents of attention</p>
<p>According to AST (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlDBYAJ1oUw">video</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.&quot; - <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/herbert_a_simon_181919">Herbert A.

we can deduce implications of what we've laid out semantically
We can then compare those implications around a different set of facts/assertions - fact-checking our thoughts - sufracing bias & contradictions. What if we laid out all our beliefs (privately) as a database such that we can later fact-check our new thoughts against that set of beliefs?

knowledge engineering & semantic representation have been used only for knowledge and facts - we've yet to use it to pattern-match & bridge opinions at scale

the elite form of communication will become semantic

Writing forces us to think, but the act of serializing a complex web of interconnected thoughts is very lossy - most connections, weights & context are either lost or conveyed differently, and every attempt to fix this leads to overly verbose, boring and incomprehensible text. -->
<p>What about complex thoughts? The act of serializing a complex web of interconnected thoughts with language is very lossy - most connections, weights &amp; context are either lost or conveyed differently, and most attempts to fix this lead to overly verbose, boring and incomprehensible text. Language is a poor medium - it evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago but now we can do a lot better.</p>
<p>What if we expressed our thoughts as directed graphs of ideas, entities &amp; concepts with weights, probabilities &amp; causal relationships? Our canvas could be a node-based software that's seamlessly integrated with the semantic web &amp; the Giant Global Graph instead of a limited text editor.</p>

<p>Writing text forces us to think, but graph construction &amp; exploration would make our thinking more precise and our understanding deeper. Mind Maps are superior when it comes to comprehension and retention of information because they organize it spatially &amp; hierarchically - engaging our brains visually. The source should always be a graph because our that's how our minds represent knowledge &amp; ideas - even though we communicate serially.</p>
<p>Let's take the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Dod9AWz8Rp4Svdpof/why-i-think-there-s-a-one-in-six-chance-of-an-imminent"><code>&quot;Why I think there's a one-in-six chance of an imminent global nuclear war (October 2022)&quot;</code></a> post by Max Tegmark for example and <u><strong>ignore if we agree with him or not</strong></u>.</p>

<p>His thesis is effectively a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>, which he goes on to explain in greater detail with text. But his tool to make that graph was probably for simple diagrams - incomparable in terms of capabilities to what we're envisioning here. Graph-first thinking just isn't how we express &amp; communicate (yet).</p>
<p>But why would we do that? What are the benefits?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>render</strong> our thoughts into different mediums: text, audio &amp; video through the use of LLMs &amp; generative AI - expanding the accessibility of our work beyond those that can view thought-graphs. A graph has many ways to be traversed so we can ask the AI to generate multiple versions. We could also specify a node path (which nodes/subgraphs and in what order) for the serialization into text and also paragraphs to be inserted at specific points (perhaps you want to write the introduction or conclusion yourself). We could also have fine-grained control such as annotating specific nodes to be skipped from the serialization or to signal their importance so that the AI adds more or less emphasis. We could have movie-maker-like software with a timeline where we orchestrate the traversal. This wasn't possible until the recent advancements of LLMs &amp; AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being able to say &quot;<strong>view source</strong>&quot; of a text article and being shown the thought-graph that the author used to generate it. The serialized output could also have an automatically generated mapping so that we can see which regions correspond to which nodes &amp; links with some highlighting and we could have both displayed side by side for synchronized &quot;playback&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about <strong>editing</strong>? Refactoring &amp; &quot;rewriting&quot; will be just a matter of moving &amp; reconnecting nodes &amp; subgraphs, followed by a re-render of the outputs by the AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could generate <strong>change reports</strong> &amp; summaries for a thought-graph throughout time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>debug / fact-check</strong> the logic in the circuits of thought-graphs. Choose ontologies &amp; fact databases and evaluate the connections of a graph for logical consistency against them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could <strong>pattern-match</strong> our thought-graphs with others and we could compute the similarity of (sub)graphs and track the provenance &amp; plagiarism of ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability</strong> - the better you annotate your thought-graph with well-known &amp; widely used semantic web concepts &amp; ontologies - the easier it will be to discover your content. People don't put #hashtags without a good reason (even though they are extremely limited).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">NYT</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.ft.com/">FT</a> have their own proprietary knowledge graphs but they publish only plain text. <strong>Analysis</strong> of journalism is at the level of word use frequency throughout time.</p>

<li>
<p>If no thought-graph exists for an article - anyone could construct it and tag it to the original resource - making it discoverable for anyone to use. <!-- TODO:LINK TO THE OTHER SECTION --></p>

<p>What if we could see the TL;DR for anything? (connected to changing the titles for less clickbait)</p>
<p>We should be able to see all references &amp; content related to any identity, event/document or entity/concept/noun as a collection of comments, reactions/votes, annotations, redirections and edits/forks which we could organize &amp; filter through the UI. Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some YouTube videos have comments disabled. Why? Could be many reasons: <strong>1)</strong> perhaps they don't want to have their content associated with low quality comments, <strong>2)</strong> maybe they don't like the <a href="https://prnt.sc/ORguwjXfLgLR">scammers &amp; bots</a> and want to protect their audience, <strong>3)</strong> maybe they haven't fully thought this through, <strong>4)</strong> or maybe they are actively trying to hide something. But anything public can be discussed on other platforms (Reddit?) - all you've done is made it harder to find that discussion but it's still there (and is most likely fractured across different platforms/subreddits). The valid reasons (<strong>1</strong> and <strong>2</strong>) can be negated with better tooling for content moderation - both for active participants (tagging, annotating, voting) &amp; the passive ones (simply consuming &amp; filtering through the UI).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if we could provide alternative titles for content and crowdsource the ones which most accurately describe it - countering the clickbait? Users could choose to view the original titles or the crowdsourced versions if there's consensus for a specific title to be way better than the original. This is already happening in StackOverflow - titles of other people's posts can be edited by moderators (or anyone?) with the goal of improving accuracy. What constitutes &quot;better&quot; and which/how votes are counted can be configurable too. But wouldn't content creators object?! Sure, but what are they going to do? But data can be composed in any way imaginable in the Giant Global Graph. This is like taking the best comment about what a post/video should be titled and through something like a browser extension programatically using that instead of the original in the UI - you can't stop that. We could even calculate clickbait scores for content creators - I bet many would have more than 90% of their content re-titled according to some criteria. We could even feed such scores into recommendation algorithms - <strong>disincentivizing clickbait</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>TODO:
Deceiving others to watch your content just for your own good is narcissistic - are we seeking knowledge or do we want to feed and grow narcissism?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The perpetual AMA (Ask Me Anything) - currently only a small handful of people have done <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA">AMAs in Reddit</a> that last only up to a few days with an extremely limiting interface in a sporadic/random fashion. What if every account had an implicit AMA associated with them (something like <a href="https://ask.fm">ask.fm</a> but a lot more powerful) and we could ask any leader/CEO/celebrity &amp; hyper agent questions with special message types and link them to their accounts? We could collectively surface the most pressing ones and make it glaringly obvious if the important ones aren't answered or if the answer is of poor quality - through different dashboards/charts &amp; sorting/filtering. We could hold them to higher standards &amp; more scrutiny. What if we could pressure companies &amp; CEOs about the use of Cobalt from African mines with slave labor? Doing a poll on <a href="https://change.org">change.org</a> is extremely ineffectual, but if something like it was integrated with a new more expressive type of social media for virality - it could have drastically different results. It is easy to ingore some obscure app but not when everything is built on top of the same interconnected identity &amp; data network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reactions that relate to a piece of content. Let's take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOPOcBVzm7s"><code>&quot;Jillian Michaels: Don't believe the keto diet hype | Big Think&quot;</code></a> video for example. How do we determine if what's in there true? All we have is a comment section and a sidebar with algorithmic recommendations. Turns out there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jillian+michaels+keto+reaction">a number of reactions</a> but they're not shown next to the video in any way - how would we know about their existence if we didn't explicitly search for them? The goal is not to be exposed to multiple points of view &amp; reach some conclusion - it's only engagement. The videos are not interlinked, but suppose they were - we could have a list of reactions displayed along with scores of disagreement and other factors and we could more easily discern which one to watch next. <!-- The way to expose the complete failure & corruption of the FDA & their misguided policies is through a bottom-up crowdsourced effort enabled by the Internet and further enabled by linked data, identities & reputation. --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the YouTube playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC9lvrBhVt4UUkhzpp3N5_x"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory | Computer Science | Khan Academy&quot;</code></a> for example. The videos are out of order, but someone has made another playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq2EDMGUqkHHjHLhp88RY-e5mN7uGMP75"><code>&quot;Journey into information theory (in order)&quot;</code></a> that is fixed. This is essentially a fork - one that is better than the original. Why can't we see a crowdsourced redirection suggestion attached to the original?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A unified identity layer, the ability to deduplicate content, to annotate semantically &amp; the move to structured data greatly helps with being able to pull everything related to something. However, one concern is negative reputation &amp; &quot;scarlet letters&quot; - the ability to taint an entity and have the bad reputation follow it without the ability to hide it. But we can develop tools, norms &amp; criteria to evaluate/rank/filter any document &amp; reaction that relates to something. Moreover, even if there isn't a direct data connection between 2 entities (one referring to the other), as long as they are both public someone could index them and make that link. This problem already exists today.</p>
<!-- hiding inconvenient facts is most worthwhile to those with the most power. Negative reputation for any entity is a net positive despite the drawbacks -->

<p>current social media has a choice architecture in the UI that's misaligned with users - they're solely optimizing for engagement &amp; time spent - the goals of people</p>
<p>we take the agency we have in search engines for granted (we explicitly type what we're looking for), but we've completely abdicated agency in the feeds that feed us information in social media - we ought to have a choice there as well
In search we are looking for something and want control. But aren't we looking for something in our feeds as well? Why not have more agency - even if it leads to less time spent on the app?</p>
<p>in the current web your interactions lead to better recommendations and better ads. In an open world your interactions would enable all kinds of insight that anyone could surface

<p>the host-centric model allows for platforms to own our content, which leads to misaligned incentives:
time spent: user disempowerment - everything is AI controlled &amp; recommender systems all the way down - attention maximization
time well spent: user empowerment in being able to control what they want to see &amp; how much of it</p>
<p>YouTube recently removed the option to sort the videos of a channel by oldest first - because why not - because they can.</p>
<p>the great attention misallocation - we all think certain issues don't get enough coverage or that other types of content get oversized &amp; undeserved attention - we need to take control of the architecture of virality and the first step is actually having a choice.</p>
<p>VERTICAL INTEGRATION:
Youtube now has posts like twitter where you talk to your subscribers - why a separate network ?! why are all these platforms reinventing the same features ?!</p>
<pre><code>Why does spotify need to build video streaming to compete with youtube?

<p>when twitter decide engagement is low they shove down your throat nonsense algorithmic &quot;recent tweets&quot; notifications you can't turn off - that's what it has devolved into. &quot;See less often&quot; from the dropdown menu does nothing. Misaligned incentives.</p>

<p>Platforms do almost everything in-house in a closed way as providing access to third-party companies to their data to solve specific problems is hard due to complications around data privacy/regulation and the need to safeguard their competitive advantages &amp; trade secrets.</p>

<p>&quot;Twitter was supposed to be a protocol allowing anyone to build products and services on top of it that drive value back to the parent company and investors. But it wasn’t a real protocol. It only pretended to be. As soon as the people behind the scenes changed their minds about what they wanted Twitter to be, the “protocol” side of Twitter got shut down. While this ruined a lot of businesses built on top of it at the time, it was perfectly predictable. Before web3, it was near impossible to build real application-specific protocols on the internet.

<p>what if we could submit all our views &amp; morals and feed that through aggregation algorithms that then score different policies to determine which ones should be chosen? And what if all this data was anonymized and yet public so anyone can re-do the aggregates?
What if we could pull ZK credentials for different criteria from our real identity and input those (in some anonymized fashion) into the aggregation algorithm?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;According to Netcraft in May 2015, the industry standard for monitoring active TLS certificates, &quot;Although the global [TLS] ecosystem is competitive, it is dominated by a handful of major CAs — three certificate authorities (Symantec, Comodo, GoDaddy) account for three-quarters of all issued [TLS] certificates on public-facing web servers.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The internet is decentralized as much as its weakest links which are DNS &amp; certificate authorities</p>
<p>By July 2022 just 3 certificate authorities (IdenTrust, DigiCert &amp; Sectigo) are responsible for <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/ssl_certificate">3 quarters of the entire market</a>.</p>
<p>Certificate authorities should be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Furthermore, content served by a website through HTTPS (so using SSL) cannot be cached &amp; cryptographically frozen in time because if the certificate is revoked then there's no way to actually prove the order of events - when was the data signed (cannot rely on internal timestamps) and until when was the certificate valid. Headjack fixes this by anchoring all off-chain events with a merkle proof on-chain &amp; sequences what's relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In a separate disclosure unrelated to Snowden, the French Trésor public, which runs a certificate authority, was found to have issued fake certificates impersonating Google in order to facilitate spying on French government employees via man-in-the-middle attacks.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)">wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet more CENTRALIZATION in checking for the validity of certificates:
reliance on OCSP which is vulnerable to DDoS, replay attacks 
turtles all the way down - CAs delegate other entities to be OCSP responders
Also if a MITM attack is possible then 
If an attacker has compromised the private key of a server and is doing a MITM attack then OCSP requests will also be going through them - rendering OCSP an unreliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because most clients will silently ignore OCSP if the query times out, OCSP is not a reliable means of mitigating HTTPS server key compromise.&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol#Criticisms">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>Freedom can be a competitive advantage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack">Substack</a> lets you leave &amp; take your subscribers with you (an email list) - a conscious choice to compete on the quality of service. <strong>But they are an outlier</strong>.</p>
<p>Headjack's fundamental premise is that it unlocks many possibilities &amp; value to users because the barrier to entry for services would be much lower and they could be composable &amp; interoperable which would lead to greater innovation, quality, choice &amp; freedom. So given that users would benefit more in this ecosystem and that their attention is finite &amp; will be spent either way - it stands to reason that there is money to be made in an even bigger pie! But competition will look different.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The rule book will be different - instead of <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-marketscompetition">vertically integrated</a> services with tons of employees that reinvent the wheel, companies would specialize and compete on different layers of the stack. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">Markets Are Eating The World</a> - there will be one for each of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage &amp; retrieval of historical events, data &amp; results of batch processes.</li>
<li>Indexing at scale and even custom indexing by specific criteria.</li>
<li>Training of AI models for recommendation systems, feeds, etc.</li>
<li>Ad serving engines that match users with ones that would be relevant to them.</li>
<li>Computed views (aggregate metrics) such as counts of likes &amp; other interactions.</li>
<li>Content moderation &amp; safety labelers (malware/copyright/offensive/spam) producing lists with flagged accounts, specific pieces of content or even entire applications.
<ul>
<li>Their output could be used not just for the final presentation layer but also before indexes, models &amp; computed views are created as they could be gamed with spam.</li>

<p>Creating a new social application would require just a bit of frontend code by a few developers with all the heavy lifting of infrastructure, data storage &amp; processing, content moderation, ad serving &amp; recommendation engines being provided by pay-as-you-go services through APIs. The (<a href="https://mattturck.com/the-power-of-data-network-effects/">data</a>) network effects will be shared by every actor in the ecosystem. Launching a proof of concept would be trivial and new business models &amp; use cases (no ads for social) would be enabled.</p>

<p>It will take some time for markets to mature and the dust to settle once specialization &amp; competition are democratized, but then prices will be low and the efficiency &amp; quality of services high.</p>
<p>what if apps have to explicitly pay to infra for their data to be stored?</p>
<p>services will no longer have the host-centric model to point to as the reason for siloing data - just the fact that we would give an address to our documents that is beyond any specific host is enough of a reason for the nature of competition to change</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Attribution is the accounting layer of the entire user-acquisition stack: social media, organic community building, referral programs or (gasp!) even ads, they’re all just inputs to attribution. It's much more than just bean-counting, though the bean-counting is important. It’s the capital ‘T’ Truth that the entire ecosystem depends on.&quot; - <a href="https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/why-spindle">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Internet monetization is somewhat like a Soviet election: It doesn’t matter who clicks and where, it’s who counts those clicks that matters. The technology and business of that counting of clicks (and everything else you do online besides) goes by the dull-sounding name of attribution, and it determines the fate of trillion-dollar companies.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's examine the following example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A recent example of questionable attribution: I tweeted about my e-mountain bike, Jason Calacanis (of all people) saw it and asked about the model. Someone posted a review from bikeradar.com, and Jason (I don’t know if this is true) probably googled for it and maybe bought it. Who deserves the attributions credit? According to Google (surprise, surprise), it’ll be Google … and they’ll take all the credit, which is why Google is worth so much and Twitter so little.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entire flow could be tracked </p>
<p>Furthermore, attribution services could credit accounts that retweet content and add more interactions with it with some of the profits</p>
<p>de-duplication through content addressing &amp; adding traceability of content helps paint the picture what happened when and by who - aiding attribution. Infrastructure companies on which applications get deployed on can handle such tracking within them but since all the data is openly broadcasted competing services could offer alternative business models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whether it be circulation numbers for 19th-century newspapers (the start of the printed ads business), or Nielsen ratings for pre-cable TV that determined ads rates there, there’s never been a media ecosystem that didn’t have attribution.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you had to conjure some collective mechanism for storing aggregated data that was selectively shareable between publisher and advertiser, it would look much like a blockchain.&quot; - <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>^^ this can be done through verifiable computation &amp; sharing indexes between publishers &amp; advertisers within index infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/attribution-rules-the-world-and-itll">This article</a> posits that attribution has to go on-chain but Headjack offers an alternative - through the infrastructure companies.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that mass media &amp; aggregation will be handled by centralized services that can save user details in logs - what we could do is make a market for user data and make it easier to opt out of such data harvesting with alternatives &amp; a way for whistleblowers to prove if a contract hasn't been honoured.</p>
<p>composable media - pick a recommender algo, search, UI</p>
<p>the history of actions and tracked events would be private and shared only between infra platforms and ppl paying for ads?</p>
<p>Identity wants to emerge
Over the long run, any stable joinable key becomes an identity as it accumulates more correlated information about you.
We see this today in the ads ecosystem, where data brokers and cross-site advertising networks use data joining to correlate information about you and track you around the internet. Email addresses, cookies, IP addresses, advertising identifiers—anything that is unique and stable can be used for data joining.

Headjack only facilitates addressing but doesn't store anything besides the history of keys and authorizations - all content is off-chain and for example GDPR compliance will affect all services but not Headjack itself (Not sure if this is true).

<p>Ads themselves are not the root evil - it's the lack of choice &amp; ability to exit in the current monopolistic world due to the benefits of vertical integration in the current host-centric paradigm</p>
<p>Any service that makes more money naturally attracts more eyes and if its some kind of monopoly there's an incentive to crowdsource a competitor if changes are wanted</p>
<p>headjack is not so much about open source (there's plenty of room for commercial players with proprietary software) - it's more about open design - the framework that all services would follow and interplay with each other</p>
<p>it's not a high level of redundancy that is needed - it's a low enough barrier for entry for any component in the media pipeline to be filled by anyone should the need arise - opening up the competition</p>
<p>there's no need for competitors - there's a need for an ecology of business within a stable framework of cooperation and competition, and if any one of them goes away a related one could fill that niche</p>
<p>do a diagram with the flow of information through a few filters &amp; layered indexes - show who is paying who and what is public and what is private and how this can support both ads &amp; subscription models to varying degrees</p>
<p>what if the whitepaper comes with an IDM specification or design such that it would be modular and the individual pieces could be described from the start so that people can jump in and work in parallel towards the same shared vision? This is the data and opinion portability network.</p>
<p>pitch the VCs: this is not constructing a single thing and trying to own it as much as possible - this is a model for collaborative media building and since it's modular and there are plenty of slices for everyone we can simply fund the best teams and not have to compete for the sections that we aren't profficient in. There's no need to fear competition because its in the best interest of everyone to simply do the next chunk that could provide a composable service</p>
<p>Perhaps the attention exonomy pie will be smaller in a world with less exploitative mechanics btw thats a good thing - the current status quo is maladaptively inflated - a paperclip maximizer</p>

<p>This can be a powerful way for new applications to get discovered - they can even pay creators to use them in order to attract new users and have their names in the URIs of content <strong>forever</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> will be the central hub to store all user preferences, social graph, DMs, progress on long-form media, personal notes &amp; bookmarks, etc. But also pictures, videos and many other types of data - the one-stop shop for all things identity. There'll be plenty of ways to provide free tiers and yet monetize for more heavy &amp; advanced use. Anyone will be able to host their own IDM.</p>
<p>IDMs could also provide a <a href="algorithms_feeds_aggregation.html#feeds--home-pages">feed</a> &amp; a home page similar to current social networks with the most &quot;relevant&quot; content for users and even serve ads, but there'll be a lot more configuration options &amp; choice because all IDMs will be in competition with each other &amp; users will be able to migrate.</p>

<p>creators will need to shift how they monetize because there won't be platform lock-in &amp; attribution :/
or actually the application attribution for content naturally leads to users checking it out - creators can and should be paid to generate content through them and based on virality of content they could get paid out? omg.</p>

<p>Let's take YouTube for example: currently it is &amp; does many things at once: storage &amp; streaming of video, a recommendation system, serving ads, social features, subscriptions, etc.</p>
<p>In the brave new world of Headjack it would be completely unbundled</p>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>is the video hash uploaded?</li>
<li>embedded player required?</li>
<li>serving ads or just charging apps for the data streams?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if some platforms don't freely provide the content but just anchor it and provide APIs like embedding youtube?</p>
<p>separate content hosting &amp; delivery from the recommendation system and the serving of ads</p>

<h1 id="the-future-of-influencer-marketing"><a class="header" href="#the-future-of-influencer-marketing">The future of influencer marketing</a></h1>
<p>Currently, companies cannot target you directly with ads without the social media platforms as middlemen - but with open data, any company could analyze the world and decide what their target audience is.
Currently, Coca-Cola targets audiences with the same ad but with some precision - imagine if they could directly target individuals with tailor-made ads based on them - what if an algorithm picks up that you're gay and coca cola send you an ad with a shirtless male (if you're male) - point taken from Yuval Noah Harari here: https://youtu.be/j0uw7Xc0fLk?t=260</p>
<p>Imagine influencers being able to use algorithms to generate synthetic versions of themselves pitching different products to different people and having the application infrastructure serve different versions to different people based on who they are. The influencer is the magnet and the algorithms are the tailors. This is the future whether we like it or not. The good thing about an unbundled media stack is that some services will let you avoid ads for a subscription fee.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing is the end game</p>

<p>No other solution has a seamless way to address content on http and bridge with traditional dns</p>
<p>traditional web2 companies/apps/websites will be able to gradually transition and anchor their content into this namespace - cost of entry would be marginal and the first to do so would get indexed and start getting shown in search results in this ecosystem first</p>

- really think about the youtuber money flows in business models

Business models - what can IDMs charge for - archive content more than 5gb

business model: develop open source with a license for commercial use that requires payment - that's ok

perhaps not possible:
Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621544497388875777


Twitters revenue does not go to its users - 0 attribution for them


"Linking to the primary source should be the norm!"

<p>Why not just show a histogram of where most of the comments are and provide a resizable window as an additional widget on the timeline (in addition to the progress cursor) which can filter comments &amp; annotations based on the range and display the threads below Reddit-style with sorting &amp; filtration options? Here's a screenshot of precisely that (ignore the colors &amp; bad style):</p>
<img src="images/startup_case_study.png">
<p>The ultimate audio/video player can offer a lot more than just a comment histogram - it has the potential to be a vibrant social experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-click repositioning &amp; resizing of the filter window to timestamp ranges for different topics plotted as horizontal bars (already done &amp; visible in the screenshot)</li>
<li>sharing links to specific ranges - as clips, but without losing the context
<ul>
<li>many channels re-upload clips from longer videos - this should instead be a simple &quot;retweet&quot; of the original material with a range (window) as a parameter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>different types of comments: annotations, questions, personal (private) notes</li>
<li>search field for within the comments that are in the current filter window</li>
<li>crowdsourced annotations (tagging resources/events/concepts/entities)</li>
<li>plotting/toggling different types of histograms (not just comment density):
<ul>
<li>plotting different types of reactions</li>
<li>where other users spend most of their time</li>
<li>where the user has already played the episode</li>
<li>comments that have more than X upvotes or up/down ratio</li>
<li>where the most controversy or facts requiring a crowdsourced check are</li>
<li>highlighting comments that match the current search filter/query/regex</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsJvFr9v7Nk">older video</a> showcasing this UI (can't resize the window with the mouse yet).</p>
<h1 id="a-unique-interface"><a class="header" href="#a-unique-interface">A unique interface</a></h1>
<p>This is nothing like SoundCloud where <a href="https://soundcloud.com/liluzivert/for-fun-prod-by-beatsbyjeff">tiny overlapping rectangles</a> with profile pictures are rendered on the timeline that you can just hover with the cursor to see the comment nor like YouTube where you can write a timestamp (<code>hh:mm:ss</code>) in a comment which becomes a clickable link that fast-forwards the player - fighting it out with the other 20 000 comments in the single linear vertically scrollable section of a 3 hour long podcast and hoping to be noticed - both are horribly insufficient and unusable. For both of them comments are just an afterthought - it is extremely hard to discuss specific parts of long-form media &amp; for good localized signal to actually surface &amp; be noticed.</p>
<h1 id="challenges-in-the-current-web2-world"><a class="header" href="#challenges-in-the-current-web2-world">Challenges in the current web2 world</a></h1>
<p>How would this work as a web2 company?</p>
<ul>
<li>For it to provide value it would need many users commenting on the same video or otherwise there will be no histogram and the whole interface will be pointless. It needs a network effect.</li>
<li>Discoverability is hard - it would require that users actively share links to it on other platforms.</li>
<li>What if YouTube/Spotify cut it off &amp; disallows embedding their players &amp; using the APIs?</li>
<li>Unclear if it should try to be its own platform or just a (browser) plugin to other platforms:
<ul>
<li>The platform way is more ambitious but requires a ton more work &amp; <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertical integration</a>: direct messages, a social graph, notifications, a feed &amp; recommendation systems, etc. Would it need to compete with YouTube &amp; Spotify at some point? The likely <a href="images/startup_failure_outcome.jpg">outcome</a>.</li>
<li>The plugin way is a much more limited experience. How would users share links to comments &amp; timeline ranges to others that don't have the plugin installed? How will users be notified for comments &amp; replies? You'd be completely beholden to the platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation"><a class="header" href="#how-headjacks-paradigm-fosters-innovation">How Headjack's paradigm fosters innovation</a></h1>
<p>Contrast that to a web built around Headjack:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of work for this UI would be minimal - reusing components already present:
<ul>
<li>Identity &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on">single sign-on</a>, DMs, notifications, progress bars, preferences &amp; connections will all be handled by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a>.</li>
<li>The heavy lifting (processing &amp; indexing all broadcasted events, perhaps moderation &amp; even ad serving) will be handled by infrastructure services which will charge the application just the right amount for the sets of API calls &amp; indexes that it needs - pay-as-you-go. There will be different competing infrastructure providers and applications will be able to migrate to the one with the best service or it may even utilize multiple ones at the same time - offering users the choice which indexes &amp; filters to use.</li>
<li>The costs &amp; team required to implement this UI will be minimal and focus would be on delivering value to users. The barrier to entry would be lower and better UX &amp; functionality would be unlocked - many more niche needs could be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application discoverability - the moment someone with a following posts a comment through it that comment would immediately be visible to their audience on applications like Twitter and the URI for the comment will contain the name of the application that was used for its generation - serving as application attribution &amp; advertisement of the alternative application. No need for influencers to explicitly share <code>&quot;hey! check out this platform where I made a comment and make sure to follow me there&quot;</code> to their audience - it'll be automatic &amp; implicit.</li>
<li>No risk of platforms cutting access to their APIs to third-party apps &amp; changing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service">ToS</a> because in this ecosystem everything is a third-party app around unified identity and data is no longer host-certified - addressing is <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">data-centric</a>. There are no <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp">MOATs</a> &amp; lock-in - everyone focuses on their niche and competes on competency &amp; offering the best possible service.</li>

<p>The most important book in the world is <strong>&quot;Evolution's Arrow: the direction of evolution and the future of humanity (2000)&quot;</strong> (<a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/EvArrow.htm">online</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/211260.Evolution_s_Arrow">Goodreads</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0646394975">Amazon</a>) by John Stewart (Member of the <strong>Evolution, Complexity and Cognition Research Group</strong>, the Free University of Brussels).</p>
<p><strong>It represents the pinnacle of recursive relevance realization &amp; adaptability for conscious life.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps 20-30% of it ended up here in the form of (subjectively) notable quotes, but reading them is not a substitute for the real thing. In all honesty, it should have been 100% - if everyone in the world had to read 1 book from cover to cover - this one (although not perfect) would bring the most benefit to life on earth. Is such a level of coherence realistic? Unfortunately not... for now.</p>
<p>It isn't perfect - it's quite repetitive and doesn't convincingly lay out what should be done, but still it provides the most important frame for how we should be thinking about our civilization.</p>
<!--

Cons from me (2 copied from Keith Gillette's review):
- quite repetitive
* Specific strategies for increasing the systemic modeling ability required for more cooperative human behavior to develop.
* A detailed enough description of how vertical markets in governance might work to really be convincing.

<p>&quot;Evolution's Arrow, by John Stewart, is one of the wisest, most insightful, and most inspiring I've ever encountered. I devoured it twice in the last week.
To tell the truth, I simply cannot speak too highly of this book. My hunch is that at the end of my life I'll still rate Evolution's Arrow as <strong>one of the most significant books I've ever read</strong>.&quot; - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIP1P5CHD9W47/#:~:text=Evolution%27s%20Arrow%2C%20by,I%27ve%20ever%20read.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Others, of course (Aurobindo, Teilhard, de Rosnay, Wright, Russell, Hubbard, and Wilber come to mind) have said similar things. What makes Stewart's contribution unique, and invaluable, is both the clarity of his argument and, especially, his vision of where and how humanity needs to change in order to align with and embody the evolutionary impulse. His chapter on creating a &quot;vertical market&quot; for models of effective global governance is worth the price of the book in itself. His vision of how to organizationally move into the future, both individually and collectively, is both alluring and compelling. Some readers may find irritating the author's habit of repetition, but I was grateful. By the time I closed the book, his main points had become so much my own that I can trust they will not disappear as a passing enthusiasm. Evolution's Arrow is both mind-expanding and trust building. <strong>If I had to recommend reading only one book on evolution and the future of humanity, I'd suggest this one</strong>. It rocks!&quot; - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIP1P5CHD9W47/#:~:text=Others%2C%20of%20course,one.%20It%20rocks!">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Long story short:</strong></p>
<p>Cooperative collectives with the ability to exclude free-riders outcompete selfish, independent populations, due to beneficial (positive-sum) interactions among cooperators. Such cooperation requires (cybernetic control) management, either arising from constraints within the individuals or imposed externally, to constrain destructive individual behavior and reign-in free-riders. Once such a controlled system is developed, it becomes an (emergent) level of organization also subject to (substrate independent) evolutionary forces and for which cooperative forms will confer a survival benefit. The upper bound of such an evolutionary process of emergent cooperation is limited only by the scope of the universe. Any organization that does not align itself with this arrow of evolution will not survive to play a continuing role in its unfolding. An adaptive individual with the capacity to evolve over its lifetime has the potential to adapt to changing environmental circumstances and therefore does not need to die in the face of the continued evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights from the text:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The potential benefits of cooperation will not be exhausted until all living processes in the universe are united in a single organisation of the largest possible scale. All the matter, energy and living processes of the universe will be managed into a single cooperative organisation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“An organism whose motivations and objectives fail to take into account the evolutionary effects of its actions will not value objectives that do. Instead, the organism will use the immense adaptive capacity unleashed by mental modelling to get better and better at serving the goals of its existing internal reward systems.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“An organism will fail to be relevant to future evolution if it remains unorganised on a single planet, serving objectives and motivations established by flawed and shortsighted evolutionary mechanisms.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are an organism in which the capacity for mental modelling has not yet realised its full potential to take over and improve our evolvability.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“With appropriate management controls, economic markets are extraordinarily good at enabling the benefits of cooperation to be fully explored and exploited in some circumstances. This is because in these circumstances markets enable individuals to fully capture the benefit to others of their cooperative acts. How do markets achieve this? If an individual in an economic market can produce anything that benefits others, he will be able to exchange it for money. If the money exceeds the cost of production, both the producer and the consumer can end up in front from the exchange.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Markets include the seeds of their own destruction. They tend to produce individuals and corporations with the power to undermine the effective operation of the market.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mentally we can abstract individuals out of this on-going process and consider them as separate and independent beings. If we do this and then ask what purpose or meaning there can be in their temporary lives, we must conclude that there can be none. From the point of view of an isolated individual, the inevitability of death makes anything he does during his life irrelevant and meaningless. If there is no afterlife, whatever he does during his short life can make no difference to himself in the long run. He still ends up dead. It is impossible to find meaning in a temporary and isolated life that is not part of some ongoing process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We can live our lives as if we are separate from the on-going evolutionary process, and make no conscious contribution to it. But individuals with evolutionary awareness will not find meaning or purpose in such a life. They will find no meaning in a life spent vigorously and energetically seeking the satisfaction of their pre-existing material and emotional urges.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What Evolution’s Arrow gets right:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change-and-test is the basic evolutionary algorithm.</li>
<li>Evolution is substrate-independent.</li>
<li>Cooperation outcompetes narrow self-interest if free-riders can be excluded.</li>
<li>The problem of goal misalignment due to the unchanging instincts and emotions instilled by genetic evolution.</li>
<li>The cybernetic superiority of markets over central planning for efficient distribution.</li>
<li>The need for outside constraints for markets to work and not self-destruct.</li>
<li>The need for a social safety net/guaranteed basic income.</li>
<li>The need for world governance.</li>
<li>The problem of capture of governments by the wealthy.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Technological progress has opened up the potential to improve the living standards of all people on this planet. But this potential for social improvement has not been fully exploited this century. It has not driven on-going social progress. Instead, at the end of the 20th century over 800 million people are chronically undernourished, and each year nearly 13 million under fives die as a direct or indirect result of hunger and malnutrition. In industrialised countries, many people spend much of their lives in unsatisfying, boring and meaningless work, while large numbers choose drugs over reality.</p>
<p>Human society has failed to produce on-going social progress in these areas because it does not include a mechanism that selects and reproduces social improvements when they are discovered or proposed. If society stumbles on improvements either by accident or by conscious effort, there is no process that locks in the improvements and perpetuates them. The economic and political markets that select and reproduce technological advances do not do the same for social improvements.</p>
<p>As we shall consider in detail later in this book, it is possible to organise human society so that social improvements are selected and reproduced, and so that social progress is as inevitable, unstoppable and natural as technological progress. And we will see that evolutionary success for humanity will ultimately depend on organising ourselves in this way.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/2.htm#:~:text=Technological%20progress%20has,in%20this%20way.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the case of the mechanisms that adapt individuals, possible improvements are developed, tried out, and selected at the level of the individual human, cell or ant. But in the case of organisational adaptation, it is the collective activity of many individual humans, cells or ants that search for and reproduce adaptations. Through these processes the organisation can solve adaptive problems collectively that individuals cannot. Just as our brain solves problems that are not understood by any cell in the brain, human markets and governments can solve adaptive problems that are not fully understood by any individual.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/2.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20the,fully%20understood%20by%20any%20individual.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The genetic mechanism is unable to do this. It cannot directly combine adaptations discovered in different species. When a relatively general advance such as a better eye is discovered, there is no process that enables it to be immediately adopted by all those species that have inferior eyes.

<p>&quot;Like the goods and services produced in human society, the key functions of the human body are all the product of the coordinated activities of thousand and thousands of differently-specialised and interdependent cells. If this cooperation breaks down, so to do our bodies. Cancer is one example of what happens when cells go their own way at the expense of the body.</p>
<p>And the cells themselves are cooperative organisations. Without extensive cooperation between the molecular processes and organelles that make up cells, we would not exist. Each of our million billion cells is made up of thousands of incredibly small and intricate parts that cooperate together to produce the functions of the cell. At the molecular level, a human cell may contain up to 100,000 different proteins. Proteins are differentiated and specialised in many ways: some provide support for the components of the cell, some form part of the cell membrane, some have the ability to contract, moving the cell or parts within it, and many are specific enzymes that regulate the essential chemical reactions that enable the cell to function. Often these enzymes cooperate to form teams in which each member regulates a particular step in a sequence of reactions.</p>
<p>Just as humans team up to form corporations, and cells are organised into organs, groups of molecules may also form larger structures called organelles. These too are differentiated and specialised, with mitochondria, the so-called power houses of the cell, releasing and converting energy for use in the cell, ribosomes providing sites for putting together proteins, the nucleus housing most of the genetic material, and lysosomes providing places in which food can be digested without dissolving other parts of the cell.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/3.htm#:~:text=Like%20the%20goods,%5B2%5D.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One of the main ways in which cooperation enables things to be done better is through specialisation and division of labour. In a cooperative organisation, every individual does not have to do everything needed for survival. Instead, an individual can specialise in a particular task, performing the task not only for itself but also for others in the group. This lets the others specialise in other tasks for the group. The result is a highly interdependent organisation in which key tasks are performed by individuals who are specially adapted and equipped to do them.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/3.htm#:~:text=One%20of%20the,%5B3%5D.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So wherever evolution has been able to fully exploit the benefits of cooperation, we always find the extraordinary level of specialisation and interdependency that results from a high degree of division of labour. We find it within cells, within our bodies, within our social systems, and between nations. And there is every reason to believe it will also be a feature of organisations that are capable of future evolutionary success on even larger scales.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/3.htm#:~:text=So%20wherever%20evolution,even%20larger%20scales.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;But it is not only through a division of labour that cooperation provides advantages. Cooperation is also able to exploit the fact that combinations often have new features that their components do not. Combinations can do things that individuals cannot.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/3.htm#:~:text=But%20it%20is%20not%20only%20through%20a%20division%20of%20labour%20that%20cooperation%20provides%20advantages.%20Cooperation%20is%20also%20able%20to%20exploit%20the%20fact%20that%20combinations%20often%20have%20new%20features%20that%20their%20components%20do%20not%5B5%5D.%20Combinations%20can%20do%20things%20that%20individuals%20cannot.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Similarly, combinations of living things can also do things that individuals cannot: amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are unable to regulate chemical reactions in the cell by themselves. But when combined to form protein enzymes, they can control and manipulate other atoms and molecules, determining how they react and what larger molecules are constructed in the cell. A flock of birds or a troop of baboons is able to detect stalking predators that individuals are unable to.

<p>&quot;Cooperative combinations can also have significant evolutionary advantages because of their larger scale. For example, larger-scale organisms can have adaptations that are more complex.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But more importantly, the ability to form larger-scale cooperative groups enables organisms to manage and manipulate their environment over larger scales. Large human organisations can operate mines, build dams and establish communications networks of a scale unimaginable to small bands of earlier humans. A human social system organised on the scale of the planet is likely to be able to develop the capacity to prevent large asteroids from colliding with the planet.

<p>&quot;A further very general advantage of cooperation is that it can prevent the harmful effects of destructive competition.

<p>&quot;The advantages of cooperation mean that a whole world of new adaptive opportunities is opened whenever living processes team up to form a cooperative organisation. This has clearly been the case when molecular processes teamed up to form cells, when cells teamed up to form multicellular organisms, and when humans teamed up to form social systems. Each of these levels of cooperative organisation has been able to conquer new environments and develop adaptations unknown to the levels that preceded them. We can be sure that new evolutionary opportunities will also be opened up as human organisation expands to the scale of the planet and beyond. Exactly what these new opportunities will be, we cannot know with certainty. The adaptive opportunities that were opened up by the move from single cells to multicellular organisms are unimaginable from the point of view of a single cell and its life experiences. What could the trunk of an elephant, the wings of a bird, the heart of a deer, or a jet aircraft possibly mean to a cell? But what we can know with certainty is that by expanding the scale of human cooperative organisation we will open up greater adaptive capabilities.

<p>&quot;The advantages continue to apply no matter how large cooperative organisation becomes. The advantages do not cease once cooperative organisation reaches a particular scale.

<p>&quot;No matter what the scale of cooperative organisation, greater benefits will be achieved by further increases in scale, whether by the expansion of existing organisations, or by the evolution of cooperation between organisations of the largest scale. Living processes that cooperate over the scale of a solar system will have much greater adaptive capabilities and opportunities than us. But their abilities will be far inferior to organisms that cooperate to manage the matter, energy and living resources of a galaxy. The potential benefits of cooperation can be expected to continue to drive increases in the scale of cooperative organisation at least until the universe is organised into a single cooperative organisation of living processes.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/3.htm#:~:text=No%20matter%20what,of%20living%20processes.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;We humans are obviously only partial cooperators. It is true that human economies can be spectacularly cooperative with an extraordinary specialisation and division of labour. It is also clear that internally, within our own bodies, we are cooperative all the way down. But anyone who tries to convince us that humans are always cooperators has a hard job in front of them.</p>
<p>The 20th century has seen millions killed in the largest wars in human history. Hundreds of millions of people in the world are chronically underfed, even though there are sufficient resources to feed us all. Millions die each year as a result. Thousands of millions will live and die without having any chance to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to participate effectively in a modern economy. They will not share in the understanding of the world and of ourselves that has been made possible by the growth of human knowledge. They will live and die without fulfilling the potential for personal development and self-awareness that is possible at this time in the evolution of humanity. And individuals, corporations and countries continue to pollute and degrade our environment even though they know they are damaging the lives of others, now and into the future.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, most of us do not feel that we are cooperators. There are strict limits to what we are prepared to give up for the common good. We know that tens of thousands die each year from starvation. But most of us will not sacrifice much to save any of them. We do not do for others what we would have them do for us.</p>
<p>We are very choosy about whom we will cooperate with: we are more comfortable cooperating with people who are likely to return any favours and to share the benefits of cooperation with us. So we cooperate more with family, friends and people we know we can trust. We are far more wary about cooperating with strangers. Before we do so, we want to be sure the strangers are trustworthy, or are put in a position where they will not take more than their fair share of the benefits of cooperation. For example, where the cooperation is a business venture we might insist on an enforceable contract, or that the investments and profits are not solely under the control of the stranger.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/4.htm#:~:text=We%20humans%20are,of%20the%20stranger.">source</a></p>

Any corporation that cooperates with the community by reducing pollution will be less efficient and will go out of business.

<p>&quot;We can conclude confidently that the barrier to the evolution of cooperation applies to all living processes. The circumstances that cause it are universal. Individuals who use resources to help others without benefit to themselves will be out-competed. They will be disadvantaged compared with those who use the resources for their own benefit. And the barrier applies no matter what the evolutionary mechanisms that adapt and evolve individuals. In the examples we have considered, the barrier has applied whether the evolutionary mechanisms are those that adapt corporations, individual humans, other multicellular organisms, single cells, or autocatalytic sets.</p>
<p>This barrier makes it difficult for evolutionary mechanisms to take advantage of the potential benefits of cooperation. It makes it difficult, but not impossible. If the barrier completely prevented the evolution of cooperation, evolution would not progress. But as we shall see in the next three Chapters, the barrier is not insurmountable.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The first major breakthrough in understanding how cooperation might evolve between multicellular animals came with the publication of William Hamilton’s theory of genetical kin selection in 1964. The central idea in the mechanism he described is very simple: consider a cooperator who shares its food with others who have not been able to gather enough. If the cooperator shares food only with other individuals who contain copies of its cooperator gene, the benefits of cooperation will go only to other cooperators. Only those who carry the cooperator gene will benefit. Non-cooperators will be excluded from any of the advantages of cooperation.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=The%20first%20major,advantages%20of%20cooperation.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kin selection is a very poor mechanism for evolving cooperation. Because relatedness is an imperfect indicator of common genes, kin selection can evolve cooperation only where the benefits from cooperation far outweigh the costs. This leaves an immense amount of beneficial cooperation that cannot be evolved by kin selection. If a mechanism is to be able to fully explore the benefits of cooperation, it must be able to establish any cooperation in which the benefits outweigh the costs. Kin selection falls far short of this. Without these severe limitations, kin selection would have been much better at organising cooperation amongst the animals around us. The potential benefits of cooperation would have driven the evolution of a complex division of labour within each population of animals, similar to what we see within our societies, our bodies, and our cells.</p>
<p>But as a theory, kin selection has been very successful. The ineffectiveness of the kin selection mechanism is consistent with the sparse and limited cooperation found amongst multicellular animals. And where there is cooperation, the way it is organised is consistent with kin selection. Much of the cooperative organisation we find amongst the animals around us is between relatives.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=kin%20selection%20is,is%20between%20relatives">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The second mechanism that enables cooperation to evolve between animals is reciprocal altruism. Again, the basic idea is very simple: an individual will not be disadvantaged if it helps another provided the other helps it in return. The individual’s initial costs of cooperating will be recouped when the other returns the favour. If the benefits of cooperation outweigh the costs, both individuals can end up in front. The cooperators will therefore out-compete individuals that don’t reciprocally help each other in this way.</p>
<p>For example, when an individual is successful in collecting food, it might share it with others who have not been so lucky. On occasions when others are more successful, they can return the previous favour by sharing their food. Over time, all will be better off than if they did not share.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=The%20second%20mechanism,did%20not%20share.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It turned out that those who were given blood were bats who had given the individual blood in the past. And those who were refused blood were those who had previously refused the individual blood. The bats knew each other as individuals, knew who were likely to return favours and who were not, and chose to give blood only to those who were likely to reciprocate.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=It%20turned%20out,likely%20to%20reciprocate.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;It turned out that those who were given blood were bats who had given the individual blood in the past. And those who were refused blood were those who had previously refused the individual blood. The bats knew each other as individuals, knew who were likely to return favours and who were not, and chose to give blood only to those who were likely to reciprocate.</p>
<p>A closer understanding of reciprocal altruism and of its limitations shows that the bats have to be this choosey. In fact, reciprocal altruism cannot be established in a group of organisms unless they are capable of refusing to cooperate with individuals that fail to return favours. If an individual continues to do favours for others that do not return the favour, the non-reciprocators will win out. An individual that cheats by receiving favours but not repaying them will gain all the benefits of cooperation without paying any of the costs. And if a cheat is within a large population of cooperators, it will do extremely well, collecting favours and never returning them. In these circumstances, cheats will prosper, increasing in numbers in the population until all cooperators die out. In such a group, the most competitive strategy will be to accept favours but not reciprocate. Reciprocal altruism will not survive, even if its benefits far outweigh its costs.</p>
<p>However, all this changes if the individuals live together for a long time, repeatedly have the opportunity to exchange favours, and have the capacity to remember which individuals return favours, and which do not. If these conditions are met, cheats will not be able to continually take benefits from the cooperators, because they will be recognised as cheats and excluded from further cooperation. Once this happens, they will not gain any of the benefits of cooperation. In contrast, cooperators will end up in front because they will limit their exchange of favours to those who have shown they will return the favours. If they cooperate in this way whenever the benefits outweigh the costs, cooperators will out-compete cheats.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=It%20turned%20out,%5B10%5D.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The whole system of reciprocity works only if there is a fair balance between the favours that are exchanged. Individuals whose favours cost more than the individuals receive in return will be out-competed. But most animals have little ability to judge whether reciprocal favours are similar in value. And having to do so further complicates the critically important job of telling the difference between cheats and cooperators.</p>
<p>All these challenges become almost impossible when acts of cooperation benefit many others, and impact differently on each of them. If a cooperative act benefits a number of others in the group, rather than a specific individual, it is much harder to work out who owes who what, and how much. But unless individuals can keep track of all this, cheats will flourish</p>
<p>The great advantage of reciprocal altruism over kin selection is that it can evolve cooperation between individuals who are not related. However, the conditions under which it works are so limited that it has not been very significant in establishing cooperation between animals. Not many animals live together for long periods, repeatedly have the opportunity to cooperate, are able to recognise each other as individuals, can remember how each individual behaved each time it had the opportunity to cooperate, and can keep track of favours owed and favours earned. Cases of reciprocal altruism have been found only in a few species of animals such as vampire bats, dolphins, and elephants, and in some species of monkeys and apes.</p>
<p>Of course, the species that meets these conditions to the highest degree is us. And the theory of reciprocal altruism fits very well with the way we relate and cooperate with people that we meet repeatedly. It works well for explaining key aspects of the cooperative relationships between people in tribal groups, closely knit communities, and in friendship networks and other stable social groupings.</p>
<p>The theory predicts that successful reciprocal altruists will have two great concerns in their relationships with others. First, they will not want to be cheated by others, so they will want to know who can be trusted to return favours. Second, they will want others to choose them as cooperative partners, so that they can share in the benefits of cooperation. They will want others to see them as trustworthy cooperators. They will not want to be seen as a cheat that should be excluded from beneficial cooperation.</p>
<p>Consistent with this, we humans have many behaviours that seem to serve the function of protecting us against cheating. For example, we tend to have an extraordinary interest in judging other people’s trustworthiness and honesty. A major part of gossip and other social communication involves swapping information that helps us to make and update these judgements. We are also reluctant to risk cooperating with strangers when we have no knowledge of their reputation and character. We are even more reluctant when we know the stranger does not depend on us for future cooperative opportunities. In these circumstances, they will lose little if they destroy their reputation with us.</p>
<p>We are also very concerned to protect our own reputation for trustworthiness and honesty, particularly amongst those that we spend a lot of time with. We often react instantly and emotionally to any attack on these aspects of our character. Most of us are also concerned to ensure that we are seen to treat our friends fairly whenever there are things to be shared, and that we repay our obligations to people we know. And we do not want to enter into obligations with friends that we might not be able to repay.</p>
<p>But even amongst humans, the capacity of reciprocal altruism to establish cooperation is severely limited, even where cooperation produces substantial benefits. As we have seen, reciprocal altruism will work only where cheats can be successfully excluded from future cooperation. This will not be the case if cheats can easily find other individuals to deal with who know nothing of their previous actions. It is only where individuals have no option but to continue living and interacting together for long periods that cheating will not pay. If an individual earns a reputation for cheating in these circumstances, it will not find other cooperators to deal with.</p>
<p>This condition is not generally met in modern large-scale economic markets. Individuals can readily leave a bad reputation behind them, and find new individuals to deal with who are unaware of their previous actions. Reciprocal altruism is therefore not the mechanism that has produced the large-scale markets that organise economic exchanges across human societies.</p>
<p>The other great limitation of reciprocal altruism is that it is only effective where the benefits of cooperation can be neatly parcelled up, precisely valued, and swapped between individuals. Where the benefits of a cooperative act impact on many individuals, reciprocal altruism cannot operate easily. This is a significant limitation. In the complex, differentiated cooperative organisation that are cells, organisms, and human societies, most cooperative acts impact on many others in the organisation. It would be impossible to separate out the effects and keep track of them as favours that have to be returned. And if favours are not returned with acts of similar value, reciprocal altruism fails.</p>
<p>So genetical kin selection and reciprocal altruism are not the mechanisms that have enabled evolution to explore the potential benefits of cooperation within cells, multicellular organisms, and human society. And they are not the mechanisms that will change humans from partial cooperators into full cooperators. They can achieve only limited cooperation under restricted conditions. If kin selection and reciprocal altruism were the only mechanisms that evolution could use to organise cooperation, evolution would not be progressive. It would not be able to exploit the benefits of cooperation by progressively building cooperative organisations of wider and wider scale.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=the%20whole%20system,and%20wider%20scale.">source</a></p>

<p>To overcome the barrier to cooperation fully, a mechanism must also ensure that those who harm others capture the effects of any harm they cause.

<p>&quot;A mechanism that ensures individuals capture all the effects of their actions would completely overcome the barrier to the evolution of cooperation.

And it would do so without giving up its self-interest in any way. It would be in the interests of the individual to treat the other as self. Anything it could do to help the other would help itself. Anything it could do to harm the other would harm itself. The individual would benefit as much from discovering new ways to help others as it would from finding new ways to help itself directly. All this holds true whether it is individual cooperators or cooperators as a class who capture the effects on others of their actions.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=A%20mechanism%20that,of%20their%20actions.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wherever complex cooperation has been able to evolve, it is because cooperators have been able to capture the effects on others of their actions. As a result, self-interest has driven them to treat the other as self. A strong example that may not be immediately obvious is an economic market. The market will reward an individual who develops a new product that benefits others by satisfying their needs better than existing products. Selling the product enables the individual to capture the beneficial effects that the product has on others. In the limited areas where economic markets work effectively, individuals benefit in this way from actions that benefit others. Where the market enables individuals to capture the benefits of their effects on others, the market aligns the interests of individuals with the interests of others.</p>
<p>In contrast, where the barrier to the evolution of cooperation has not yet been overcome, cooperators do not capture the beneficial effects on others of their actions. For example, in our economic system, a person will not capture the benefits of providing food to people who are starving in an African famine. It would be far more profitable to invent an improved mousetrap. Or a new weapon of mass destruction. But when the barriers to cooperation in human society are overcome, and when all individuals capture in full their beneficial effects on others, the provision of food to the starving will be a lucrative way to make a living.</p>
<p>So a mechanism that ensures that cooperators capture the effects of their actions on others would allow cooperation to be established wherever cooperation is worthwhile. Organisms that pursue only their own interests would act cooperatively. The mechanism would establish cooperation between organisms whose basic nature is greedy and selfish.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=Wherever%20complex%20cooperation,greedy%20and%20selfish.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;One general way in which cooperators could capture the effects of their actions on others is if another individual takes action to ensure this happens.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;These three examples illustrate how a manager can control a group of individuals in ways that enable the potential benefits of cooperation to be explored. Left to themselves, a group of individuals that interact as equals is unable to establish complex cooperative organisation. It will not be in the interests of any member of the group to initiate this cooperation, no matter how great the benefits that it can provide. This is because individuals will not capture the benefits of cooperation that they initiate, particularly in the face of cheating, free riding and theft.</p>
<p>This all changes when an extra layer of organisation is added to the group. This extra layer is the manager, made up of one or more entities who are able to control the group. The addition of this extra layer converts the original organisation of equals into what can be called a vertical organisation. Extending this terminology, the original organisation that had only one layer of organisation can be referred to as a horizontal organisation.</p>
<p>The manager can use its power to organise the horizontal group in whatever way is necessary to ensure that cooperators, free riders and cheats capture the effects of their actions on others in the organisation. To the extent that the manager is successful in doing this, the interests of all individuals will be aligned with the interests of the group, and individuals will treat others as they treat themselves. Self-interest will be the same as group interest, and the vertical organisation will have successfully created cooperative organisation out of self-interested components.</p>
<p>The manager of an ideal vertical organisation will be able to support and sustain whatever cooperative arrangements are best for the group. By determining which individuals succeed in the group and which don’t, an ideal manager will be able to construct whatever organisation is needed for evolutionary success. The ideal manager will be able to make it in the evolutionary interests of members of the group to undertake whatever forms of cooperation are best. There will be no form of cooperative organisation that the manager cannot construct. Management will be able to produce any pattern of specialisation and any form of division of labour amongst the members of the group. The barrier to the evolution of cooperation will be completely overcome.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasising that the manager must have the capacity to control the group if the manager is to be able to organise complex cooperative organisation. If the manager is to stop cheats, free riders and thieves, it must have power over them. It must be able to make them do things that would not otherwise be in their interests, and they must not be able to avoid this control by influencing the manager in return. If they can, they can escape control, and continue to undermine cooperation. This is what happens when criminals use bribery to influence police, and when friendships with staff undermine the ability of an executive to manage staff in a corporation.</p>
<p>Individuals that are equals within a horizontal organisation obviously cannot impose the level of control needed to stop cheats, free riders and thieves. Individuals that band together to act as a group can achieve some control over cheats. But when they do this they are no longer acting as individuals. They are forming a manager and a new level of organisation that can control individuals.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=These%20three%20examples,can%20control%20individuals.">source</a></p>

<p>What vertical organisation does is take the control of cheats out of the hands of restrictions that have evolved for other reasons. As we shall see in the next Chapter, the controls established by managers are tuned by evolution specifically to promote cooperation. Controls that are best at promoting cooperation will win evolutionary struggles. And evolution will adapt the controls to find better ways to support cooperation and to prevent cheats and free riders from escaping control as they evolve.</p>

<p>&quot;If it is not in the evolutionary interests of managers to organise cooperation, the barrier to cooperation cannot be overcome. And unless evolution is able to find comprehensive ways to overcome the barrier, it will not be able to progressively build cooperative organisations of wider and wider scales.</p>
<p>To a person at the turn of the 20th century, the answer to these questions might seem obvious. There is plenty of evidence from recent human history to show that if you give a person power over others, the power is likely to be abused. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the 20th century individuals such as Stalin and Hitler who have had the most power seem to have been responsible for the most human deaths and misery.</p>
<p>Time and time again we have seen rulers and governments sacrifice the interests and often the lives of their people in order to stay in power. Many governments have been guilty of persecuting minorities on the basis of their religious beliefs, ideology or race. White South Africans and Australians are notorious for their exploitation and abuse of the indigenous peoples of their countries. And those who have the wealth to influence governments have never been shy about getting governments to use their immense power to favour them over others.</p>
<p>And there is abuse of power all the way down, at all scales. An extraordinary number of catholic priests have used their position to sexually abuse children, and, for most of the 20th century, the hierarchy of their church used its power to hide these practices and to protect the guilty. Even within families, individuals with greater power will often abuse others physically, sexually, emotionally or economically. And anyone who has worked in a large corporation knows that executives use their power over employees for many purposes that have little to do with the efficiency of the organisation.</p>
<p>These abuses have obscured the fact that the extraordinary level of cooperative organisation found within cells, organisms and human society has been achieved only through vertical organisation. But does this level of abuse mean that the ability of vertical organisation to establish cooperation is fundamentally limited? Is this abuse the price we have to pay for the benefits of cooperation that can be produced only by vertical organisation? Or is it simply that current human organisation and its obvious flaws should be seen as part of an evolutionary progression in which the flaws will eventually be overcome? Is this just an evolutionary stage we are going through? And if so, how will the flaws be overcome?&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/5.htm#_ednref1:~:text=If%20it%20is%20not,the%20flaws%20be%20overcome%3F">source</a></p>

When human groups were small and numerous, competition was strong and continual. But as human societies grew larger and fewer, competition between them has decreased. We will see that in the absence of strong and continual competition, the key to the evolution of cooperative human societies is the discovery of new organisational structures. These must align the interests of the ruler or government with those of the members of the society. When this is achieved, a government driven purely by self-interest will manage in the interests of the society.

<p>&quot;But the possibility of competition for the position of ruler would arise again whenever a ruler died. Other individuals could then compete to take over the position. Some might even hasten the death of the ruler to open up this possibility. The scope for this competition would be reduced if the number of people who were qualified to take the position of ruler were limited. For example, if only children of the existing ruler were permitted to become the ruler. This greatly reduced the numbers of individuals who had the supreme incentive to overthrow the ruler.</p>
<p>However, this method of controlling destructive competition has had limited success. History is full of examples of sons killing fathers, wives killing husbands, and brothers killing brothers in order to meet whatever restrictive criteria were set to determine who could take the position of ruler. The result has been as destructive to the proper management of these human societies as competition between RNA molecules was to the interests of proto cells.</p>
<p>The solution was the same as in cells: the ruler had to manage the organisation to establish processes and structures that could control even rulers. Laws and methods of enforcing laws had to be established that could prevent rulers and those who could become rulers from seriously damaging the society. The effect of these laws and enforcement processes would be to move toward realigning the interests of rulers and potential rulers with the interests of the society as a whole. As we shall see, the establishment of controls over rulers (including governments) so that their interests were aligned more closely with the community has been very important in the evolution of human society, and will continue to be so.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/6.htm#:~:text=But%20the%20possibility,%5B14%5D.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;For continued evolutionary success, human society must be able to establish cooperation wherever and whenever it is beneficial to society as a whole. As we have seen, this can be achieved if a system of government aligns the interests of the individual members of society with those of the society as a whole. This will ensure that individuals who pursue their own interests will pursue the interests of the society. But government will do this only if the interests of the government are completely aligned with those of the society. When this condition is met, governments that pursue their own interests will also pursue the interests of the society. They will use their power to organise cooperation that serves the interests of the society.</p>
<p>Where the interests of government are not aligned in this way, the society will not be able to fully exploit the benefits of cooperation to satisfy the needs of its members. This would be the case for a society in which the destiny of governments is controlled by the citizens who have the greatest economic power. In such a society, it would be in the interests of the wealthy to have the government manage the society in their interests rather than in the interests of the society as a whole. Many believe that our current social systems are in fact organised in this way: in a 1992 survey of US citizens, 80 per cent said that they thought their country was run for the rich. But our present democratic governments and the economically powerful tend to disagree with this. They generally argue that there is little need to radically change our social systems. They are vigorous supporters of the status quo. They claim that our current democratic systems are, in the broad, the best available forms of government. Democratic government is as good as it gets.</p>
<p>But throughout history, rulers, governments and those who benefit most from them have always extolled the virtues of the particular form of government that provided them with their wealth, power and self-esteem. They often claim that their system has been designed in accordance with God’s will, or even that they themselves are gods, or at least that they have God on their side. And they commonly promote ideologies, myths and world views that support their system as the ultimate form of government, as the culmination of human history, and as the best and fairest method of organising human society. Any who push for alternative forms of government and who are sufficiently successful to threaten the established order have commonly been killed, jailed, beaten, or treated as criminals. They are often branded as mentally unstable, idiots, sexual deviants, ignorant and unscientific, or as being in the pay of enemy governments.</p>
<p>There are no examples from history of governments that have taken an evolutionary approach to systems of governance. Governments have never seriously promoted the view that they and their systems are temporary, merely a transitory step along the way to new and better forms of governance. Universally they have failed to demand that society should continually be searching for improvements in government, and should establish systems of government that are designed to evolve and to be better at evolving.</p>
<p>All this is exactly what would be expected of managers who have been constructed by evolution to pursue their own interests, and who have not been subject to controls that align their interests with those of the organisation they manage.</p>
<p>As we will see in detail, our current systems of government fail to meet the evolutionary ideal. Democratic processes are not sufficient to completely align the interests of the governors with the governed. As a result, even highly democratic human societies do not harness the benefits of cooperation in the interests of society as a whole. A major challenge for humans in the future is therefore to devise forms of organisation that overcome this limitation, and that are more likely to be successful in evolutionary terms. Even though our societies may not be subject to strong and continual competition at present, we must organise our societies cooperatively so that they will be competitive in future evolution. If evolution on this planet is to continue to progress by exploiting more of the potential benefits of cooperation, we must meet this challenge successfully.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/6.htm#:~:text=For%20continued%20evolutionary,this%20challenge%20successfully.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A tribe could be managed by a set of hard-wired predispositions that could reproduce itself in most of the members of the group, and cause them to expel any remaining members who did not appear to contain the hard wiring. I will refer to such a manager as a distributed internal manager: the management is internal to the individuals being managed, and is distributed in the sense that it is contained in each of the members of the group.</p>
<p>A distributed internal manager is formed of a set of hard-wired predispositions that are reproduced in each of the members of a group of organisms. As we have seen, the predispositions can be genetic, or can be strong moral or other beliefs that are learnt during the life of the organism. As we shall see, internal managers are established by genes in insect societies and in the societies of cells that are multicellular organisms. And they were established by systems of moral and religious beliefs as well as genetic predispositions in the early tribal societies that preceded modern human societies managed by external rulers.</p>
<p>A distributed internal manager clearly has the potential to organise a group cooperatively. It can hard wire individuals so that they participate directly in cooperation, provide resources to maintain group activities, refrain from cheating, theft and free riding, and punish individuals who undermine cooperation. In this way it can cause individuals to act in the interests of the group as a whole, and to treat others in the group as self. An internal manager can organise cooperation directly by hard wiring specific cooperative behaviours in individuals. Or it can do it indirectly by controlling exchanges between individuals so that individuals capture the benefits of their cooperative acts on others. For example, individuals might be hard wired so that they do not cheat in reciprocal cooperative exchanges. This would enable the reciprocal altruism mechanism to operate successfully.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/7.htm#:~:text=a%20tribe%20could,to%20operate%20successfully.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Distributed internal management that is unable to suppress competition from other managers within the organisation will not be effective at organising cooperation. It will not be able to capture all the benefits of cooperation. An example is the process of genetical kin selection that we considered earlier. Kin selection begins to operate when an individual contains a genetic manager that predisposes it to cooperate with others. The normal process of reproduction will produce related individuals who also contain the same manager. If it is to be successful, the manager must capture the benefits of the cooperation it produces. So evolution will favour genetic managers that organise individuals to direct their cooperation only towards others who contain copies of itself. As we have seen, managers can use relatedness to target their cooperation in this way. But, because relatedness is not a perfect indicator of a shared manager, a manager will not capture all the benefits of the cooperation it organises. Some of the benefits will leak to individuals who do not include the manager. The manager will not find it profitable to organise some forms of cooperation even though it provides net benefits. As a result, the ability of genetical kin selection to organise cooperation is limited.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/7.htm#:~:text=Distributed%20internal%20management%20that%20is,to%20organise%20cooperation%20is%20limited.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;It will be in the evolutionary interests of mangers to quickly suppress any new managers that arise within the organisation. But this will cause another problem—the suppression of new managers will also suppress evolutionary innovation. In the case of the tribes of humans that were managed by sets of strongly held beliefs and other behavioural predispositions, this meant that new ideas and innovative beliefs could not be tolerated. Any deviant behaviour that conflicted with the set of moral beliefs that managed the group would be vigorously suppressed. Groups that were organised in this way would therefore have very stable systems of belief, but at the price of a stunted ability to adapt and innovate.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The evolution of insect societies and of multicellular organisms illustrate how internal management can control and organise a group of living processes to suppress competition and promote cooperation. It can be as effective as external management. But internal distributed control is not as visible or as obvious as external control. This is not just because it controls individuals from within. It is also because the control is distributed amongst each of the individuals that are being controlled. The operation and evolution of internal management cannot be understood by looking at only the behaviour and the evolutionary fate of just one individual. The behaviour and the evolutionary fate of all of the individuals who contain the manager must be taken into account. An internal manager organises its group as a coordinated whole, and it can be understood only as a whole. For example, it is not possible to understand the evolutionary significance of moral codes or systems of religious beliefs without recognising their group effects.</p>
<p>A group that is managed by distributed internal management is as much a vertical organisation as a group managed by a separate, external manager. It has an additional layer of organisation compared with a group that is not controlled by a manager. This additional layer is the set of predispositions that are reproduced in each of the members of the group through time. These predispositions control and coordinate the behaviour of members of the group. In the examples we have considered, the additional layer can be a set of genetic predispositions or a set of learnt beliefs such as moral codes.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/7.htm#:~:text=The%20evolution%20of%20insect,such%20as%20moral%20codes.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So the evolution of life has all the key features of a process that is fundamentally progressive: there are virtually unlimited potentials for improvement through the establishment of wider-scale cooperation between living processes. And these potentials can be exploited only through a step-by-step process in which each step necessarily builds on and improves on the previous step.</p>
<p>But there is another aspect of the progressive evolution toward increasing cooperation that we have not yet considered. We have seen that the formation of organisations in which a manager controls the other members of the organisation will enable cooperation to be exploited within the organisation. The alignment of the interests of the manager and the interests of the organisation as a whole ensure that the pursuit by managers of their own adaptive interests also serves the adaptive interests of the organisation. However, the extent to which the manager and other members of the organisation are actually successful in discovering the forms of cooperation that are best for the organisation depends on their adaptive ability. It depends on how good they are at evolving, how smart they are at searching out the best cooperative arrangements, and how innovative and creative they are at discovering new cooperative adaptations and adapting these to changing conditions.</p>
<p>Their evolvability will also determine how effective they are at discovering how to form cooperative organisations of wider and wider scale. Living processes that evolve by the genetic evolutionary mechanism will be slow to discover how to form cooperative organisations. The genetic mechanism has no foresight or ability to anticipate future evolution. It has no capacity to understand the progressive evolutionary sequence of increasing cooperation that I have outlined, and no ability to use the sequence to guide its evolution. The genetic mechanism will still exploit the potential benefits of cooperation, but only when it blindly stumbles on cooperation that proves successful. In contrast, when living processes arise that develop an understanding of the progressive nature of evolution, evolution can move far more rapidly and directly to produce cooperative organisations of increasing scale. Once organisms know where evolution is headed and develop the ability to use this knowledge to guide their own evolution, progressive evolution will accelerate.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/7.htm#:~:text=So%20the%20evolution,evolution%20will%20accelerate.">source</a></p>

But the search will be more efficient if the changes are chosen so that they have a better than random chance of proving adaptive.

<p>&quot;The evolution of recombination and sex arguably have been the most significant advance in the evolution of the evolvability of genetic systems.

Sex and recombination are successful strategies for organisms because they make them smarter at evolving.</p>
<p>How does recombination do this? The genetic changes produced by recombination are better targeted because of the way in which the changes are generated. Recombination produces changes by putting together different combinations of existing genes. Unlike mutational systems, it does not produce changes in the genes themselves. As we have seen, most changes to genes that are already functioning well are likely to be harmful. They will disrupt the effective operation of the gene, and produce a damaged organism. Instead recombination generates changes by mixing existing genes together in different combinations.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An obvious limitation of the genetic mechanism is that its capacity to learn is restricted. The targeting of genetic changes involves a form of learning. However, when organisms such as ourselves discover an adaptation that is effective in particular circumstances, we can learn to produce it again whenever those circumstances arise again. This is the ultimate in targeting. Trial-and-error is completely eliminated. But a genetic system cannot do this. It has no way of sensing the environment to distinguish one set of circumstances from another. So it cannot learn that particular adaptations are useful in particular environmental conditions. As a result, the genetic mechanism is unable to respond to specific environmental events by immediately producing a genetic adaptation that it has learnt is effective in those circumstances.</p>
<p>Nor can the genetic mechanism construct complex models of how its environment is likely to change through time, and use these to determine what genetic changes it should produce. Unlike us, it cannot use internal models to plan ahead, to test possible changes before they are tried out in practice, or to maintain adaptations that have no immediate benefits but will pay off in the future. A genetic system can miss a major beneficial adaptation by a single mutation, and never know. And it is unable to use a model of the direction of evolution to guide its search for better evolutionary adaptation.</p>
<p>But it was not these limitations of the genetic mechanism that immediately drove the progressive evolution of new adaptive mechanisms. The key limitation that did this was the inability of the genetic mechanism to adapt the organism during its life. As we have seen, a genetic change-and-test mechanism is unable to operate within the organism. This is because destructive competition must be suppressed within the genetic managers of single cells and the genetic managers of multicellular organisms. If genetic changes could arise and compete within the genetic managers during the life of the organism, destructive competition would undermine cooperation. Evolution therefore favoured arrangements that suppressed the possibility of this competition. But without competition between genetic alternatives, new and better adaptations could not be discovered within the organism. Genetic management could not provide a change-and-test process to adapt the organism during its life.</p>
<p>The inability of the genetic mechanism to adapt organisms continually during their life meant that there was enormous potential for the evolution of new mechanisms that could do this. This drove the evolution of new change-and-test mechanisms within the organism. Initially these were not evolutionary mechanisms. The adaptations that they produced were not passed from generation to generation. But, as we shall see, in humans these internal adaptive mechanisms have evolved into new evolutionary mechanisms that have overcome many of the limitations of the genetic mechanism. And we will see that they have to evolve further in the future to overcome other limitations and to improve the evolvability of humans as individuals and collectively.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/9.htm#_ednref2:~:text=An%20obvious%20limitation,individuals%20and%20collectively.">source</a></p>

The new system had to immediately reward behaviours that produced longer-term benefits, even though they might not deliver any actual immediate benefits. If attainment of a longer-term goal meant that the organism had to achieve a particular immediate goal, the new system had to produce a need within the organism to achieve the immediate goal. The need would motivate the search for behaviour that could satisfy the immediate goal, and therefore produce the longer-term benefits. The new system would have to do this even though achievement of the immediate goal might produce no actual immediate benefit to the effective operation of the organism. Rather than test alternative behaviours against their immediate impact on essential variables, the new system had to test alternatives against their ability to produce immediate internal rewards that were proxies for longer-term benefits to the organism.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/10.htm#:~:text=The%20genetic%20mechanism%20had,benefits%20to%20the%20organism.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;If the individual is to adapt in ways that are best for its longer-term interests, it needs an internal reward system that immediately rewards the adaptive behaviour. The reward system must do this even though the behaviour does not immediately improve the operation of the organism. As a result, when multicellular organisms began to exploit the potential benefits of cooperative social organisation, evolution produced complex new internal reward systems. These systems could motivate and reward the search for social behaviours that provided no immediate benefit, but that served the longer-term interests of individuals by enabling them to interact more effectively with others in the group.</p>
<p>As multicellular organisms such as dogs, monkeys, elephants and apes began to form complex social organisations, the genetic mechanism expanded and diversified the internal reward systems into complex emotional systems. This produced social animals that experience a wide range of emotional feelings. These motivate, reward and punish behaviours that often do not immediately impact on the efficient functioning of the organism, but will in the longer term. We humans, the most social of multicellular organisms, experience a wide range of emotions and feelings such as fear, anger, guilt, love, frustration, curiosity, sexual pleasure, self-esteem, grief, delight, shame and depression. All these were initially tuned by natural selection to motivate and reward behaviours that would adapt the organism in ways that produced longer-term benefits.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/10.htm#:~:text=if%20the%20individual,longer%2Dterm%20benefits.">source</a></p>

To them, their internal emotional rewards are ends in themselves. They spend their lives in the pursuit of satisfying emotional states, oblivious that this is evolution’s way of getting them to discover the behaviours that are best for producing evolutionary success. Evolution has produced in them a virtual reality that motivates and organises their behaviour. But for them it is their ultimate reality. They cannot see beyond it to its real purpose. Most humans currently fall into this category. They are unaware that the emotional goals that drive their pursuit of wealth, power, sex and social success are merely means to evolutionary ends, not ends in themselves.</p>

If circumstances change, and the immediate goals established by the organism’s existing internal reward system no longer produce evolutionary success, there is no adaptive process within the organism to change the immediate goals.

<p>&quot;In the evolution of life on this planet, these limitations are being overcome by the development of a capacity to use mental models to guide the adaptive process. This capacity has evolved most fully amongst humans. With mental modelling, the organism is able to form a mental representation of how aspects of its environment will unfold over time. It can use these representations to see what effects possible adaptations will have in the future. In its most highly developed form, mental modelling can work out the consequences of a wide range of hypothetical behaviours in hypothetical environmental circumstances. The evolution of mental modelling is a major improvement in the ability of organisms to adapt for the outside/future.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/10.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20evolution,the%20outside/future.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Importantly, the models used by the organism can be improved continually as the animal accumulates knowledge and experience during its life. Where it discovers that a model does not accurately predict the future effects of its actions, the organism can revise the model to take account of its discovery. As the organism gains more knowledge of how its environment is structured, how the environment changes through time, and how different behaviours can produce different effects in different environmental circumstances, the ability of its models to target and test possible adaptation will improve. And this improvement in adaptability occurs during the life of the individual, without any involvement of the genetic evolutionary mechanism.</p>
<p>As the modelling capacity develops, individuals increasingly accumulate substantial stores of knowledge during their lifetime. This knowledge is extremely valuable to the individual, enabling it to use models to discover better adaptations by predicting the effects of alternative actions. For example, the more knowledge that an early human hunter accumulated about game animals, the better he would be at using mental models to predict which hunting strategies would be most effective. But the knowledge accumulated by an individual during his life died with the individual. So as a capacity for mental modelling evolved in early humans, there was an enormous potential evolutionary advantage to be had by any new arrangement that was able to transfer the store of knowledge between individuals. Any individual that could pass his accumulated knowledge to his offspring, or any individual that could obtain knowledge off others would be greatly advantaged in evolutionary terms.</p>
<p>Imitation enabled some transmission of adaptive behaviours between individuals. But it was only with the evolution of language that humans gained a comprehensive ability to share the knowledge they accumulated during their life. Through language, a discovery made by an individual could be passed to others and used by them in their modelling. Importantly, this enabled knowledge to be accumulated and built-on from generation to generation. Each new individual born into the population did not have to start again, with empty models. And in cooperative human societies, particular individuals could specialise in the collection of specific types of knowledge that were useful to the group. The result has been a complex and growing culture of adaptive knowledge that is passed from generation to generation.</p>
<p>As knowledge accumulated across the generations, the modelling capacity improved its ability to predict the consequences of possible behaviours. It became more accurate, could predict the consequences of wider ranges of events, and could evaluate the effects of possible adaptations over wider and wider scales of space and time. This improvement in adaptability continued the evolutionary progression that began with the emergence of the first simple change-and-test processes that adapted organisms for the inside/now. Since the first simple processes emerged, internal adaptive processes have progressively developed the capacity to take into account the effects of possible adaptations over wider scales of space and time. The continuation of this progression is now enabling humans and humanity to build mental models of the formation and evolution of the universe.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/10.htm#:~:text=Importantly%2C%20the%20models,of%20the%20universe.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Linear modelling can work accurately and effectively for processes that are simple. But it is quickly overwhelmed as complexity increases. It is of limited use for understanding processes consisting of many interacting components that all contribute to how the process unfolds. These processes cannot usually be analysed into step-by-step chains of cause and effect. Linear modellers are unable to understand or predict the behaviour of these more complex processes. As a result, linear modelling is also limited in relation to the scales of space and time over which it can model the effects of possible adaptations. Over larger scales of space and time, most processes interact with other processes and become far too complex to understand by linear modelling. For these reasons, logical step-by-step analysis is notoriously ineffective for modelling and understanding the unfolding of complex systems such as human economic systems, ecosystems, human history and the mind and other complex adaptive systems.</p>
<p>External linear modelling is the mental capacity we use most often as we adapt consciously in our day-to-day life. It enables us to understand simple processes and to predict their future behaviour. We have built and designed our technology, our housing and our gadgets so that they can be readily understood and manipulated with linear modelling. The environment we have built around us is far more simple and mechanistic than our natural environment. It has been designed by linear modellers for linear modellers. In contrast, we need a capacity for systemic modelling if we are to manipulate our natural environment successfully.</p>
<p>Linear modelling is also the basis of most science as it is currently practised. The scientific method has been extraordinarily successful at understanding simple, linear processes and parts of more complex systems that can be reduced to simple processes. But the traditional scientific approaches have had little success in dealing with fields that cover complex systems such as ecology, psychology, economics, sociology and the other social sciences.</p>
<p>Humans that are capable only of linear modelling are unable to manage large complex organisations competently. In order to manage complex human social groups successfully, a manager such as a king or other ruler must be able to mentally model the effects on the group of alternative acts of governance. He (or his associates) must be able to mentally simulate the effects of his management on the group. For this reason, until at least some humans had moved beyond the limitations of linear modelling, humans were unable to form complex cooperative organisations managed by external managers. To be competent, external managers must be capable of some form of systemic modelling. It was not until about 10,000 years ago that human societies organised by rulers or other external managers were formed.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/11.htm#:~:text=Linear%20modelling%20can,managers%20were%20formed.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;A typical example of the late 20th century is an individual who single-mindedly pursues career goals, repressing and ignoring the internal physical and emotional signals that indicate he should also serve other adaptive needs. In extreme cases, if the individual continues to ignore stress and depression, the result is physical, emotional and mental breakdown.</p>
<p>The problem will worsen as the capacity for external linear modelling grows. As knowledge accumulates, the growing ability of modelling to discover effective adaptations means that it will be used increasingly to determine how the individual behaves. More and more, mental modelling will guide the individual on how to achieve the adaptive goals established by his internal reward systems. The result will often be that the individual ignores and represses some of the motivations and needs associated with his pre-existing adaptive system, even though these may be essential for producing behaviour and adaptations that are critically important for the effective operation of the individual.</p>
<p>The need to integrate mental modelling with the pre-existing physical and emotional adaptive systems is a problem that will be encountered by any organisms that begin to develop a capacity for mental modelling. Wherever in the universe mental consciousness emerges, it will initially clash with the processes that have adapted the organism up until then. As the mental system develops, it will be used increasingly to control and run a complex, multi-level organisation that it does not understand or appreciate. It will have ultimate power over a complex system it is only dimly aware of. Initially it will have the power but not the wisdom to manage the organism, and it will not know itself well enough to see its own limitations. On every planet where mental consciousness emerges and develops, there will be a demand for personal growth programs that promote the development of psychological skills that can deal with this problem.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Systemic modelling is made possible by the acquisition of generalised mental schema that represent how various types of complex systems unfold and behave through time. Where the individual has a schema that matches a particular system, he can immediately envisage how the key processes of the system will behave. He immediately sees how the system as a whole unfolds over time, rather than having to follow the interactions of the parts of the system step-by-step.</p>
<p>Unlike a linear modeller, a successful systemic modeller does not analyse a system into its parts and then try to predict the behaviour of the system by seeing how the parts interact together in a step-by-step fashion. Where the mental schema match the system, the systemic modeller will see how the system will behave at a glance, with a flash of insight or intuition.</p>
<p>As systemic modellers improve their ability, they accumulate schema of greater and greater complexity that enable them to model the effects of possible adaptations over wider and wider scales of space and time. They are able to take account of the effects of possible adaptations that linear modellers are completely blind to. But systemic modellers can continue to use linear modelling where it is useful. For example, they still use it where they do not have appropriate schema, and use it as they build up and adapt schema.</p>
<p>Because current science is largely founded on linear modelling, it has great difficulty in accepting and incorporating the findings and insights of systemic modelling. This is the case even where systemic modelling has proven to be indispensable for advancing science. Studies show that few of the great discoveries of science have been produced by linear, logical thinking. A high proportion originated from intuitive leaps made possible by systemic modelling. But before these insights gained scientific acceptance, they had to be translated into simple models based on linear chains of cause and effect. Until this was done, the discoveries were invariably rejected as unscientific.</p>
<p>Importantly, systemic modellers have the potential to manage complex cooperative organisations. They can model mentally how the organisation will respond to their management. They can choose to implement the management that is shown by their mental modelling to advance their interests and those of the organisation. The development of systemic modelling amongst some humans about 10,000 years ago made possible the rise of human communities managed by kings and other rulers.</p>
<p>But until the capacity for systemic modelling is turned inwards to further develop the capacity for self-management, systemic modellers tend to pursue the same kinds of values and goals as linear modellers. They are likely to have already developed a capacity for linear self-management. As a result, they probably have analysed and rejected the religious belief systems that were important in organising cooperation within earlier human societies. They will tend to be ego driven and self-centred, and use their enhanced adaptive ability to serve their existing internal physical and emotional goals. They are likely to use the enormous power of systemic modelling to seek narrow goals such as social status, power, feelings of importance, and sexual and other physical pleasures.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/12.htm#:~:text=Systemic%20modelling%20is,other%20physical%20pleasures.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As the capacity for internal systemic modelling develops, it will increasingly tend to undermine the individual’s self-centeredness. In part this will come about because the individual will begin to see that his particular motivations, goals and values have no absolute value or justification. He will find no valid reason to put them ahead of any other set of goals, and he will be unable to show that a life spent exclusively serving his particular goals and values is inherently better than alternative ways of life. These views will be strengthened as he develops the capacity to model the social processes that have helped to produce his particular set of motivations, goals and values. These models will show that his goals and other adaptive characteristics could have been very different. A different upbringing, different social conditions, a different culture, and he would have different wants and beliefs, and different likes and dislikes. This understanding will begin to undermine the individual’s belief that all his energies and adaptive capacities should be solely directed at satisfying his own particular self-centred reward system. It will also help him understand the different perspectives of others, and the causes of those differences. He will be less able to ignore and dismiss alternative perspectives.</p>
<p>Self-centeredness will also be undermined as the individual begins to model the social processes in which he is embedded over wider and wider scales of space and time. He will quickly become aware of his dependence on the effective operation of his social system. He will see that in many respects, he cannot achieve his personal goals unless the social system functions well. The systemic modeller will understand that in many instances, the interests of the social system coincide with his interests, and it is in his interests to promote the effective operation of the social system.</p>
<p>When his models of the social system can span historical scales of space and time, he will increasingly see himself and others as temporary. He will tend to see himself as just one of the enormous number of individuals who make up the social system at any time, and who each follow their particular dreams and goals for the relatively short period of their life. It is only the social system itself that will appear to be able to have any permanence and significance. From this perspective, a life spent solely serving self-centred internal rewards and motivations will appear particularly absurd. Such a life can contribute nothing to anything in the universe that has any chance of continuing in existence, or of having meaning in any broader context. This wider perspective can make it easier for the individual to find value in supporting the effective operation of his social system, or at least the part he interacts with most often. Alternatively, if the individual continues to live a self-centred life, the broader perspective can produce the existential despair that has been common in the 20th century. A wider perspective makes a self-centred existence appear temporary, meaningless, and futile.</p>
<p>So systemic modelling will tend to undermine self-centeredness. But it does not conclusively point to a new set of values that the individual should pursue. It eventually undermines individualism, but it does not establish a new set of objectives that can guide the individual. It leaves the individual with ambiguity and uncertainty. A belief in cultural relativism is a typical product of systemic modelling. All values, all goals and all motivations are seen as equally valid. Internal systemic modelling increasingly provides self-managers with the ability to harness their motivations and reward systems to new objectives, but it does not establish what those new objectives should be. This is, of course, the position that systemic modellers find themselves in today. It is only with the development of evolutionary modelling that humanity can again find individual and collective direction.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/12.htm#:~:text=As%20the%20capacity,and%20collective%20direction.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The evolutionary modeller will see himself and human society as a product of evolutionary processes that have a past, present and future. He will understand that his values, beliefs and other characteristics have been produced by past evolution, and he will know why these take the form they do. The evolutionary modeller will see himself and his society as evolutionary work-in-progress. His mental models will show him that humanity is situated part way along a progressive evolutionary sequence, and he will see the future evolutionary possibilities and challenges that confront us. The evolutionary modeller will see what work he and others must do if humanity is to be successful in future evolution.</p>
<p>The evolutionary modeller will be aware that future success for humanity will require the progressive development of cooperative human organisations of larger and larger scale, and of higher and higher evolvability. And he will see that this will require the development of a new psychological capacity in individuals, evolutionary self-management.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/12.htm#:~:text=The%20evolutionary%20modeller,evolutionary%20self%2Dmanagement.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We have seen how the development of internal systemic modelling can weaken the tendency of the individual to put his narrow personal satisfaction ahead of all else. But systemic modelling leaves the individual in no man’s land. It is unable to replace the weakened self-centred goals with new values and objectives. Internal evolutionary modelling can do this. It can produce psychological conditions within the individual that will increase the likelihood that the individual will adopt evolutionary objectives.</p>
<p>First and foremost, evolutionary modelling enables the individual to see the absolute absurdity of continuing to pursue his pre-existing goals at the expense of evolutionary objectives. With an evolutionary perspective, the individual will see that his pre-existing goals are flawed and short sighted, the product of inferior and limited evolutionary mechanisms. The individual will know that his pre-existing goals are evolution’s inadequate attempt to cause him to behave in ways that will bring evolutionary success. Once he has much more effective ways of consciously pursuing evolutionary success, he is likely to see it as absurd to continue to serve the flawed goals.</p>
<p>Second, evolutionary modelling enables the individual to see that humans do not have any choice about whether or not they will pursue evolutionary goals. Whether they serve the pre-existing goals, or use modelling to consciously pursue the objective of future evolutionary success, they will be serving evolutionary ends. The only choice they have is about how good a method they will use to pursue evolutionary ends. They can pursue evolutionary ends by serving pre-existing goals that were established by inferior evolutionary mechanisms. But their evolutionary modelling will tell them that these goals will not guide them toward evolutionary success in the future. Alternatively they can use a superior evolutionary mechanism to pursue evolutionary goals. They can use evolutionary modelling to identify and implement whatever is necessary to enable humanity to participate in the future evolution of life in the universe.</p>
<p>Third, evolutionary modellers will see that their personal psychological struggle over what objectives they should pursue has a wider evolutionary significance. They will see that their struggle is part of the unfolding of a critical step in the evolution of life on this planet. A similar psychological struggle will be played out on any planet in the universe where organisms become conscious of the evolutionary processes that have formed them and that will determine their future. Evolutionary modellers will see that the way in which humans resolve this struggle will determine the longer-term evolutionary significance of humanity. They will understand that if humanity turns its back on evolutionary objectives and continues to serve the pre-existing goals, we will be evolutionary failures. In an evolutionary sense, humanity would die. We would be irrelevant to the future evolution of life in the universe. For humanity to choose to continue to pursue only pre-existing adaptive goals would be to choose evolutionary suicide and irrelevance. But this would not be a realistic option for a humanity that is capable of evolutionary modelling. Once an individual develops a capacity for internal evolutionary modelling, to reject evolutionary objectives would be as unthinkable as is suicide to an individual who is psychologically healthy.</p>
<p>And finally, evolutionary modellers will see that once they have developed the capacity for evolutionary self-management, the direct pursuit of future evolutionary success will not involve any self-sacrifice. They will be able to find motivation and emotional reward in whatever is necessary to pursue evolutionary objectives. Evolutionary self-managers will manage their pre-existing mental, emotional and physical adaptive processes so as to align their operation with evolutionary objectives. This will mean that pursuit of their managed and modified pre-existing goals will result in the pursuit of evolutionary objectives. Self-management will ensure that all pre-existing mental, emotional and physical adaptive processes will also serve the evolutionary objectives identified by evolutionary modelling.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/12.htm#:~:text=We%20have%20seen,by%20evolutionary%20modelling.">source</a></p>

Evolution will have produced a self-evolving organism. Evolution will no longer have to get the organism to do what is best in evolutionary terms by hard wiring it with internal rewards that are correlated with evolutionary success. The organism will no longer spend its life in the pursuit of emotional rewards that are evolution’s indirect way of getting the organism to pursue evolutionary success. By consciously managing its emotional and motivational systems the organism will be able to move at right angles to its biological and social past.

<p>&quot;As we have seen, the full potential of mental modelling as an adaptive and evolutionary mechanism will not be realised until it is used to develop a capacity for self-management. Mental modelling cannot fully take over the adaptation of the organism until this capacity is developed. It will be unable to use its understanding of evolution to guide the adaptation of the organism. The first step toward achieving self-management occurs when the modelling capacity is turned inwards. Just as modelling the external environment has enabled organisms to manage and manipulate it, modelling their mental, emotional and physical adaptive systems will enable the organisms to manage these systems. Once the organisms are able to understand how their mental, emotional and physical adaptive systems operate, the evolutionary and other functions they perform, and the consequences of changing them, the organisms will be able to mange them to adapt more effectively. And the organisms will be able to manage their motivational and emotional systems so that they find satisfaction is pursuing evolutionary objectives.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/12.htm#_ednref5:~:text=As%20we%20have,pursuing%20evolutionary%20objectives.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;In each these first three organisational milestones, cooperative organisation was produced by external management, rather than by distributed internal management: in the first, matter and a proto metabolism were managed externally by an autocatalytic set of proteins to form a self-reproducing molecular process; in the second, sets were in turn managed externally by RNA molecules to produce simple cells; and in the third, simple cells were in turn managed by the DNA of a larger cell to produce complex eukaryote cells.</p>
<p>Why was it that none of these first three major organisational milestones were produced by distributed internal management? To see why, we need to remember that internal management controls a group of entities by predisposing each of the entities to behave in particular ways. It can do this only if the controls that establish the predispositions are reproduced in each of the entities. Examples of these types of controls are clusters of genes that are reproduced in each member of a group of animals, and clusters of learnt behavioural predispositions such as beliefs and norms that are reproduced in each member of a group of humans. We also need to remember that if a system of internal management is to evolve and adapt, it must include a change-and-test process that tries out different management controls.</p>
<p>This means that if a group of entities are to be managed cooperatively by distributed internal management, the entities must include internal controls that are evolvable and can be reproduced in all members of the group. Internal management could not play a part in producing cooperative organisation until internal controls of this type had evolved.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/13.htm#:~:text=In%20each%20these,type%20had%20evolved.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The formation of multicellular organisms again substantially increased the scale over which living processes cooperated. Their larger size enabled multicellular organisms to develop more complex internal arrangements. This made possible the evolution of the organs and systems needed for more sophisticated internal adaptive processes. As we have seen, the genetic managers of multicellular organisms have been able to organise the activities of millions of cells to cooperatively produce complex nervous systems and brains. These have enabled organisms to learn and discover better adaptations during their life, store the results of this learning, and use it to target the search for adaptation in the future. The genetic manager itself was unable to adapt organisms during their life, but it has produced nervous systems and other internal adaptive processes that can.</p>
<p>Genetic distributed internal management also produced the next major organisational milestone. But this time genes organised cooperative groups of multicellular organisms rather than cooperative groups of cells. Ant, bee and termite societies are the most widely recognised examples of this fifth organisational milestone. The genetic managers of multicellular organisms were able to organise societies once the managers had developed the ability to produce and adapt cooperative interactions between organisms. A group of multicellular organisms could be managed by internal genetic predispositions if these were reproduced in each of the members of the group. This could be achieved if the group began with an individual that reproduced to form the other members of the group. A genetic manager produced in this way could predispose the members of the group to act cooperatively. It could also organise them to exclude from the group individuals who were less likely to contain the manager, and to restrict reproduction to those most likely to contain the manager.</p>
<p>Initially, the first societies of organisms organised by genetic managers could not adapt as a coordinated whole during their life. This is because their genetic management could not include a genetic change-and-test mechanism that operated within the society. As we have seen, to maintain full control over an organisation, a genetic manager must suppress competition from alternative managers within the organisation. It therefore cannot try out new mutated managers within the organisation during its life. So, as with multicellular organisms, the genetic managers of insect societies had to establish new adaptive processes within the societies. They had to organise new change-and-test processes that operated during the life of the society.</p>
<p>Insect societies managed by genetic managers have not yet established internal adaptive processes anywhere near as sophisticated as those contained in the more complex multicellular organisms. There is no equivalent to the central nervous system or the brain. This is because insect societies are limited in their ability to explore fully the benefits of cooperation between their members. They have not been able to establish the extensive cooperative division of labour that has enabled multicellular organisms to produce complex organs such as the eye, heart, kidney and brain. Even the most complex insect societies contain only four different types of members.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/13.htm#:~:text=The%20formation%20of%20multicellular,different%20types%20of%20members">source</a></p>

The seventh could begin to unfold only once an organism with a capacity for systemic modelling had emerged. And the full potential of the seventh milestone will be realised only when there is an organism with a capacity for evolutionary modelling and self-management. Of course, life on this planet began to acquire these capacities only with the emergence of humans and our recent ancestors.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Like genetic predispositions, inculcated behaviours are resistant to change during the life of the individual. Once a person is inculcated with a system of religious beliefs and norms, they are likely to be followed no matter what the consequences to the individual. The individual will continue to follow norms even though it may mean giving up more immediate biological and social satisfactions. History gives abundant examples of where individuals have been prepared to die for their beliefs. An individual can be as immutably hard wired with inculcated behaviours as with genetic predispositions.</p>
<p>Of course, most behaviours that humans learn during their life are not as fixed and inflexible as inculcated norms and moral codes. Practical behaviours that are used in our day-to-day activities such as preparing food and performing work can be changed and improved continually during a person’s life. We are able to adapt these behaviours in whatever way works best. In contrast, inculcated norms are followed even when they do not work well for the individual, and bring nothing but trouble.</p>
<p>But it is the ability of inculcated behaviours to control our actions no matter what the consequences that enabled them to produce a new form of cooperative organisation in humans. This ability enabled inculcated behaviours to establish distributed internal management. Like genes, if inculcated behaviours are reproduced in each member of a group of individuals through time, they can control and organise the group. Inculcated behaviours can hard wire the individual to behave in ways that would not otherwise be in his immediate interests. They can cause individuals to act cooperatively, and to avoid non-cooperative behaviour that would otherwise produce immediate gratification.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/14.htm#:~:text=Like%20genetic%20predispositions,produce%20immediate%20gratification.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The fundamental advantage of management by inculcated behaviours is that it can overcome this limitation of genetic management. It can control the aspects of organisms that must be managed to produce cooperative organisation, but without preventing adaptation and change in other aspects of the organisms during the life of the group. Importantly, it can achieve this even in large groups containing individuals that are distantly related. The advantage of clusters of inculcated behaviours is that they can be reproduced in all individuals born into a band or tribe, irrespective of the relatedness of the individuals to other members. Genetic diversity does not have to be suppressed within the group. Nor does behavioural diversity have to be suppressed. Only the particular behaviours that are needed to control the band to produce cooperative behaviour have to be inculcated in all members of the tribe. It is only in relation to these behaviours that destructive competition must be prevented, and change cannot be tolerated. Alternatives can be tried out for all other behaviours, whether they are learnt or gene-based.</p>
<p>As a result, in tribes of early humans managed by inculcated behaviours, sexual reproduction could continue to try out genetic changes without producing destructive competition. And tribal members could continue to test out changes in learnt behaviours that were not controlled by the manager. They could attempt to invent better tools, weapons, cooking methods, and ways of collecting food. It was only behaviours that were part of the manager that had to remain fixed and frozen, and had to be reproduced accurately in all members of the tribe.</p>
<p>As a result, cooperative groups managed by inculcated behaviours could grow larger and live longer than those with genetic management, without having to freeze all other evolutionary adaptation within the group. So human foraging bands and tribes managed by inculcated norms and other beliefs were capable of a much higher level of evolvability than insect societies. Within the tribe, non-management features that were gene-based could be continually adapted. And individuals could continually search for improvements in non-management learnt behaviours, and pass their discoveries onto others, accumulating knowledge across the generations.</p>
<p>The emergence of this new form of distributed internal management enabled a significant increase in the scale and complexity of cooperation amongst early humans. Previously, some forms of cooperation had evolved amongst humans through genetical kin selection and reciprocal altruism. These mechanisms were discussed in Chapter 5. But kin selection, a form of genetic internal management, could produce cooperation only within very small family groups of highly related individuals. As groups grew in size, kin selection was incapable of holding them together, and they would break up into smaller family units.</p>
<p>Reciprocal altruism was limited to producing simpler forms of cooperation, and then only within small groups in which members interacted repeatedly over long periods of time. As we saw in Chapter 5, it is only in these restricted circumstances that it is in an individual’s interests to cooperate rather than to cheat by failing to return cooperative favours. In a small group, non-cooperators may lose out because they will be branded as a cheat, and excluded from future beneficial cooperative exchanges. But reciprocal altruism will not work where individuals meet only occasionally. In these circumstances, individuals will not lose much if those that they cheat refuse to cooperate with them again. Individuals will end up in front by taking favours but not returning them, and moving on to do the same to other individuals who have no knowledge of their reputation.</p>
<p>In contrast, inculcated behaviours is able to organise cooperation between individuals who rarely meet. For example, a manager can include behavioural norms that require the individual to cooperate with other individuals who also contain the manager. In these circumstances, even if one of the cooperators gets more of the benefits than others, all the benefits of cooperation will be captured by the manager. But for this to work, the norms must direct cooperation only towards other individuals who contain the manager. The norms must organise individuals so that they identify other individuals who have the same cultural background as themselves, and therefore the same codes and norms, and the same manager. And then the norms must ensure that individuals cooperate only with these others, and not with outsiders, so that only the manager benefits from the cooperation. Ethnocentricity is essential to the evolutionary success of distributed internal managers made up of inculcated behaviours.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/14.htm#:~:text=The%20fundamental%20advantage,of%20inculcated%20behaviours.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Distributed internal management was able to exploit the benefits of cooperation more effectively and over wider scales than kin selection and reciprocal altruism. But it did not replace or overturn the smaller-scale cooperation produced by the earlier mechanisms. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism continued to operate within the larger-scale groups, organising cooperation between closely related individuals and amongst those who lived or worked together for long periods. Many of the behavioural predispositions that evolved to organise this cooperation are still in place today, producing the cooperation within families and inside friendship groups that are still a feature of modern human society.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/14.htm#:~:text=Distributed%20internal%20management%20was,of%20modern%20human%20society">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But the hold of the manager over an individual would be greatly strengthened if the individual’s mental modelling of the world led him to believe that the codes and norms were in his best interests. Of course, accurate mental modelling of the material world would not lead the individual to this conclusion in many situations. It would often not be in his immediate material interests to follow the codes and norms.</p>
<p>But this difficulty does not apply to mental models that include supernatural beliefs. For example, if an individual could be led to believe that there was an after life, and that he would find happiness in the after life only if he followed the tribe’s norms in this life, he would believe it in his interests to follow tribal norms. The same would apply if he thought that individuals who broke norms would eventually be punished in this life by supernatural entities. In this way, supernatural belief systems have the potential to sanctify moral codes and norms, entrench them in a group and ensure they maintain their hold over members throughout their life. They can entrench behaviours that would not otherwise be in the immediate material interests of individuals.</p>
<p>Managers that were able to organise and inculcate religious and mythological belief systems of this type gained a significant evolutionary advantage. They would have been better at maintaining management control over the tribe, and therefore better at exploiting the benefits of cooperation. Tribes organised by such a manager could out-compete other tribes. And the tribes with the most effective religious and mythological belief systems would have been the most competitive. Evolution would have favoured religious and mythological belief systems that were better at entrenching moral codes and norms.</p>
<p>The types of belief systems that were best at inculcating codes and norms would have changed as human knowledge increased.  For example, as humans accumulated more and more information about their material environment and how it worked, only those belief systems that were not contradicted by this knowledge could retain credibility and control. The belief systems most likely to survive were those that were largely untestable in the material world, and that could accommodate new discoveries about the world. Belief systems that were more specific and concrete can be expected to have disappeared earlier. For example, many tribes believed that after death, tribal members went to live in the next valley, a far-off island, or some other specific place that the tribe did not visit. Such a belief could not survive direct knowledge of the other place.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/14.htm#:~:text=But%20the%20hold,the%20other%20place.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In summary, distributed internal management established by inculcated behaviours is able to produce cooperative organisations that are more adaptable and evolvable than those established by internal genetic managers. This is because only those behaviours that must be controlled to establish cooperation are fixed and frozen within the organisation. All others are free to adapt and evolve within the organisation. In contrast, in insect and other societies controlled by genetic managers, all genetic adaptations are fixed and frozen during the life of the society, not just those needed to produce cooperation. Like multicellular organisms, insect societies must evolve completely new internal change-and-test mechanisms if they are to search for better adaptation during their life.</p>
<p>But the evolvability of human tribes and other groups managed by inculcated behaviours is not as effective as it could be. The evolvability of these groups is limited because their management cannot be improved and adapted during the life of the group. As we have seen, the most successful internal managers will be those that organise the group to quickly stamp out potential cheats, free riders and competitors that arise within the groups. Any individual within the group who does not obey all codes and norms could be a free rider who would take the benefits of cooperation without contributing anything to the group. Unless he is brought under control or expelled, such an individual could undermine cooperation, and out-compete the manager.</p>
<p>For these reasons, successful human tribal groups, organised religions and modern cults that are managed by inculcated beliefs are intolerant of deviance from the group’s norms. Those who are different are generally hated and demonised. Individuals who do not follow the codes and norms of the groups are punished harshly or expelled from the group. Only managers that organise their group in this way can be successful. But the result is that changes in management that might improve cooperation or adapt the management to changing circumstances cannot be tried out within the group during its life. Like genetic managers, management based on inculcated beliefs cannot include a change-and-test process that operates within the manager during the life of the group. As a result, tribal societies, organised religions, and modern cults are notoriously conservative about their central codes and norms.</p>
<p>In principle, a manager could get around this limitation if it were smart enough. It could let changes in management arise within the group, and assess whether each change is harmful or beneficial. The manager could then suppress those that are harmful, and incorporate any changes that are better, improving the group and its management. But like genetic managers, management based on inculcated behaviours does not have the capacity to do this. Within the group, it cannot distinguish between management changes that produce cheats and those that produce better adaptation. To survive it must therefore suppress all changes in management that arise within the group, whether the changes are good bad. It must treat all changes as if they were bad. Moral systems must be paranoid, as well as intolerant.</p>
<p>For these reasons, in groups organised by norms and moral codes, new forms of management can emerge only in limited circumstances. For example, changed management may be established when a new group is founded by a small number of deviant individuals who are expelled from or choose to leave an existing group. Or new management may be able to take over an existing group when new behaviours are promoted by a charismatic leader, or in times of great crisis when many individuals in the group are likely to accept that their existing belief systems have failed them.</p>
<p>Social organisations would be more evolvable if their managers had the ability to search for improvements in management during the life of the organisation. As we will see in the next Chapter, human external managers who are capable of systemic mental modelling have this ability. Human rulers can continually adapt their management of a society in the light of experience if they are capable of systemic modelling. The emergence of humans with this capacity was essential for the 7th major organisational milestone in the evolution of life on this planet.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/14.htm#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20distributed,on%20this%20planet.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This extraordinary explosion in the scale and complexity of cooperative organisation in the last 10,000 years would not have been possible without the emergence of a new form of management. In contrast to the distributed internal management of tribal societies, the new management was external. The members of human societies were no longer controlled only by inculcated behaviours. They were now governed externally by powerful rulers. But it was not the externality of the new management that enabled it to organise human societies that were far better at exploiting the potential benefits of cooperation. It was the ability of the new management to adapt its controls during the life of the society. The ruler could continually try out new controls in the search for improved management. He could adapt his management as circumstances changed. In contrast, the internal management of tribal societies had a very limited capacity to evolve during the life of the tribe. As we have seen, successful internal managers must include behaviours that actively suppress alternative management within the society. If alternatives cannot be tested within the group, internal management cannot adapt or evolve during the life of the group.</p>
<p>The immensely greater evolvability of externally-managed human societies has enabled them to discover much more effective forms of cooperation, including complex divisions of labour. In just 10,000 years societies governed by rulers have ousted tribal societies over the entire planet. This is obviously not because of any innate difference in the capacities of the members of the tribal societies compared with governed societies. It is due to differences in organisation. Governed societies have a much greater capacity to exploit the benefits of cooperative organisation than tribal societies. They are better at discovering ways to ensure that the members of society can capture the effects of their actions on others and on the society as a whole.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=This%20extraordinary%20explosion,as%20a%20whole.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Only a manager with a capacity for systemic modelling can plan management changes in a complex organisation, trace the effects of changes when they are implemented, and assess whether a particular change has produced improvements or not. Such a ruler and his associates will be able to construct mental models of how the society unfolds through time, and how it would be affected by alternative management acts. When the effects of an act are different to what was predicted, the ruler can change his assessment of the usefulness of the act, and amend his mental models to improve their predictive ability.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=Only%20a%20manager,their%20predictive%20ability.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This improvement in systemic modelling has enabled management to be less restrictive and more tolerant of difference. We saw in relation to tribal groups managed by inculcated behaviours that management must be extremely conservative if it is unable to assess whether changes in the behaviour of group members are harmful or not. Such a manager cannot afford to let the members change their behaviours in ways that have any possibility of undermining cooperation. If the manager cannot distinguish changes that have good effects from those that have bad effects, it must suppress all those changes. This seriously restricts the ability of the group to adapt and evolve.</p>
<p>As a result, early human rulers with limited capacities for mental modelling had to manage conservatively. They had to greatly limit the freedom of their subjects to try our new behaviours. Freedom, creativity and innovation had to be restricted to what the ruler and his associates could cope with, given their limited ability to model and understand the consequences of social innovation.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=This%20improvement%20in,of%20social%20innovation.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The management task of the early rulers was much easier when the behaviour of the members of the society was already straight-jacketed by effective internal management. As we have seen, distributed internal management could suppress cheating, free riding, theft and destructive competition within a society. An external manager could get away with being far less competent if the society was restrained by a system of mythological and religious beliefs that entrenched and reproduced suitable moral codes and norms. Leading an army to defend the society, organising collective projects such as irrigation schemes, fostering productive economic exchanges and maintaining harmonious and cooperative social relations within the society were all much easier where the behaviour of the members of the society was controlled by appropriate inculcated belief systems.</p>
<p>As with the evolution of tribal societies, some systems of myths and religious beliefs were better at underpinning effective external management, and they were favoured in competition between societies. Belief systems were likely to do better if they produced behaviours that made it easier for the ruler to organise effective cooperative activities, legitimated the authority and power of the ruler, and predisposed individuals to behave in ways that benefited society. It was in the interests of rulers and their associates to promote the inculcation and reproduction of belief systems that strengthened their own positions, whether or not they were believers themselves.</p>
<p>As externally-managed human societies increased in scale, producing cooperative organisations of peoples from a number of tribal and ethnic backgrounds, the religions that survived and flourished were those that were more inclusive, and did not preach hatred and aggression against others of different ethnicity. Mythological and religious belief systems that produced acceptance of others from different tribal and ethnic backgrounds produced societies that were able to grow in size, incorporating and managing more and more peoples. Such a belief system could help to produce a cohesive and effective multi cultural society, such as the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>But external management could not rely on the assistance of these internal belief systems forever. As the capacity for mental modelling amongst the members of society improved with the accumulation of knowledge, the consistency of the belief systems with external reality was increasingly questioned. Mythological and religious belief systems were undermined further as individuals developed the ability to turn their modelling capacity inwards to analyse, evaluate and criticise the validity of their own thoughts and beliefs.</p>
<p>Particularly in the last two hundred years, a significant proportion of individuals in more complex human societies has developed a strong capacity to use internal linear modelling to critically evaluate their own beliefs. Increasingly, this has produced a decline in the extent to which individuals are internally hard wired by inculcated beliefs to behave in ways that produce a cooperative and easily-managed society. For more and more individuals, god, tradition and duty are all dead. Their behaviour is now guided largely by internal reward systems that are mostly self-centred, except for the legacy of the kin selection and reciprocal altruism mechanisms. These continue to predispose us toward some cooperation within our families and friendship groups. But this aside, our reward systems tend to promote behaviour that advantages the individual—they largely ignore the effects of our behaviour on others.</p>
<p>This undermining of belief systems that previously helped organise social behaviour has led to the explosive rise in individualism of the last century. Increasingly, it has been left solely to external management in the form of government to manage self-centred individuals in ways that align their interests with those of the society as a whole. In large part, the rise of self-centred individualism has necessitated the massive increase in the size and scope of government that we have seen this century.</p>
<p>As the capacity of rulers for systemic modelling improved during the last 10,000 years, they were better able to cope with diversity and creativity within their societies. Increasingly they could distinguish between changes in behaviour and technology that would benefit society, and those that would harm it. Instead of straight-jacketing society, suppressing all innovation in areas that might be harmful, they could now target their suppression only at harmful changes. Rulers no longer had to rely as much on the assistance of inculcated belief systems to suppress all changes that might be harmful.</p>
<p>Competition between societies tended to favour those that were able to achieve greater adaptability and evolvability in this way. The result has been a potential for greater freedom for members of human society, and societies that are far more creative and innovative. As the capacity of rulers and governments for systemic modelling has improved, human societies have become more evolvable, not only because of the improved ability of management to adapt its controls, but also because it has allowed greater freedom of adaptation amongst the members of the society.</p>
<p>Improved ability to manage diversity and change also enabled governments and other rulers to establish the controls that have allowed large-scale economic markets to arise and flourish. At their heart, economic markets are made up of the same types of exchanges between individuals that underpin reciprocal altruism. An individual gives goods or services to another, and the other reciprocates with goods, services, or money of equivalent value. But the reciprocal altruism mechanism is incapable of establishing the types of exchanges that are essential to modern markets. As we have seen, reciprocal altruism cannot organise exchanges between individuals who are not known to each other and who may not deal with each other again. Rather than cooperate, strangers will pursue their own immediate interests by cheating in exchanges and by stealing. And without cooperative exchange between strangers, modern markets will not emerge.</p>
<p>So the reciprocal altruism mechanism was not responsible for the emergence of large-scale modern markets. Large-scale markets were made possible only by the existence of governments or other rulers. External managers could make market exchanges work by patching up the failings in the reciprocal altruism mechanism. They could do this by establishing a system of controls that prevented cheating and theft. Governments and other rulers typically developed laws and enforcement systems that punished cheating in exchanges, enforced contracts, and prevented theft by establishing enforceable property rights.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=The%20management%20task,%5B5%5D.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;In summary, modern economic markets have an extraordinary ability to efficiently call into existence an enormous diversity of goods and services that are matched in type and quantity to the needs of the members of the society. And this ability is all a consequence of the capacity of markets to make cooperation pay. Within an economic market, an individual can capture the beneficial effects on others of many of his actions. It is in his interests to do things that benefit others. As a result, markets are able to harness the self-interest and creativity of individuals to produce benefits for all who have purchasing power in the market. Economic markets are one of the most effective ways that evolution has yet discovered to organise cooperation amongst self-interested components.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=In%20summary%2C%20modern,self%2Dinterested%20components.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The most fundamental limitation of centrally-planned governance is that governments and other rulers will always lack the information needed to work out what sort of economic activities are best for the society. A government would need an immense amount of knowledge to decide what range of goods and services would have to be produced to best satisfy the preferences of citizens. Imagine what you would need to know even to work out the quantities and types of shoes that would have to be produced in a complex society to match the diverse and changing needs and preferences of consumers. There is no way that central planners can ever collect the information needed to model a complex society with sufficient detail and accuracy to properly plan economic activity.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=The%20most%20fundamental,plan%20economic%20activity.">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is important to recognise here that the market mechanism uses a standard change-and-test process to discover the mix of goods and services that will match consumer needs. Like central planners, producers never can know consumer preferences accurately, so they try out their best guesses when they make production decisions. These production decisions are tested by consumers. Production that does not match consumer preferences will be rejected, prices will fall, and production will be changed. This change-and-test process will continually search for the best match between production and consumer needs, and will adjust production to changes in the needs of consumers, the types of goods that can be made, and other circumstances change.</p>
<p>There are three important features of this change-and-test process that are worth noting. Firstly, the process is not internal to humans. It operates through the collective actions of individuals, just as the adaptive processes in our brains operate through the collective actions of cells. It is truly a supra-individual adaptive process. Secondly, the change-and-test process can solve the problem of how to match production to consumer needs even though no human involved in the process might know how to do this. The supra-individual adaptive process can get the right answer even if the producers who happen to be rewarded by the market for best matching the needs of consumers have done so by luck or accident. Like any trial-and-error process, it can get the right answer even if the trial-and-error is completely blind and ignorant.</p>
<p>Finally, the test in the change-and-test process is applied by consumers. It is the purchases made by individuals in a market that ultimately decide the quantity and nature of goods and services that are produced. Through the market mechanism, consumer preferences determine the profitability of each good and service, and thereby control its production.</p>
<p>So markets are much more effective than command economies at exploiting the benefits of cooperation in economic activities. They enable participants to capture the effects of their actions on others, as assessed by those who feel the effects. In contrast, in a command economy the effects of actions are assessed by central planners, who are in no position to judge them accurately. They do not know enough to organise the cooperative economic activities that best satisfy the needs and preferences of consumers. As a result, members of centrally-planned societies will often not capture the actual effects on others of their actions. Things they could do to satisfy the needs of others will not be profitable. The society will fail to fully exploit the potential benefits of cooperation.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=It%20is%20important,benefits%20of%20cooperation.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The challenge for the government is to get its bureaucracy to do what the government wants them to. It must align their interests with those of the society. If the government fails to do this, the bureaucrats will pursue their own personal interests at the expense of the society. In principle, the government can do this by rewarding bureaucratic work that serves its objectives, and punishing work that does not. But the government is in no position to do this effectively. To do so, it would have to know exactly what actions of the bureaucrats would benefit the system and what would not. The government would have to have a sufficiently detailed knowledge of the circumstances and issues being dealt with by each bureaucrat to independently work out and check what each should be doing. But it does not have this knowledge. If it did, it would not need the bureaucrats in the first place. </p>
<p>It can try to get around this difficulty by developing multi-level bureaucratic hierarchies, with each level attempting to manage the level below to align its interests with the higher levels, and ultimately with the interests of government. But unless a level completely duplicates the work of the level below, it will never have the detailed knowledge necessary to fully and accurately evaluate the work of that level. Employees in bureaucracies always have more detailed work knowledge than their supervisors, unless their supervisors completely duplicate their work. And a level that completely duplicates the work of the level below would not solve this problem. The interests of the duplicating level would not be aligned with those of the government unless it was managed by a level that duplicates its work and knowledge, and so on.</p>
<p>As a result, bureaucracies employed by governments and other rulers are notoriously inefficient at carrying out the tasks set for them[. Members of bureaucracies can serve their own interests at the expense of the organisation. Without fear of being held to account by their superiors, they can avoid risk, avoid responsibility, hide behind rules even when the rules are ineffective, work inefficiently, and avoid difficult and demanding work. When they do these things, they can claim that they are doing their job efficiently. Their supervisors will generally not know enough detail about their work to show otherwise. As a result, individuals will not capture the effects of their actions on the objectives of the organisation.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=The%20challenge%20for%20the,objectives%20of%20the%20organisation.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;From where does the intelligence of the market come? As we saw earlier, the superior ability of the market to solve economic problems comes from its use of supra-individual change-and-test processes. These processes use trial-and-error in addition to the knowledge of participants to solve complex adaptive problems. Markets can solve economic problems even though they do not contain the knowledge to build a model that could be used to work out a solution. Change-and-test processes are particularly superior to mental models where there is insufficient knowledge to build an accurate model. Because of this, the best that humans can do to solve complex social problems where there is uncertainty and incomplete knowledge is to set up supra-individual change-and-test adaptive processes such as a market. The use of the intellect alone will fail, as central planners have demonstrated. In these circumstances, governments and other rulers have found that they can promote cooperation better by establishing markets than by direct intervention. Markets are better than calculated and planned interventions at ensuring that citizens can capture all the effects on others of their actions.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/15.htm#:~:text=From%20where%20does,of%20their%20actions.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;External management by governments or other rulers has proven far more effective at organising human societies than internal management by inculcated beliefs. The evolvability of societies that are externally managed by rulers capable of systemic modelling is vastly superior. Human societies managed by governments or other rulers have been able to discover and establish far more complex and effective cooperation between their members, and to adapt their management as circumstances change. In the 10,000 years since external managers first emerged, their management ability has improved significantly. But governments and other rulers are still limited in their ability to directly organise cooperation. They lack the information to plan and implement the detailed interventions that would be necessary to ensure that members of the society always capture the effects on others of their actions. Governments lack the ability of economic markets to achieve this in many circumstances.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Another very important example of services that will not be supplied adequately by a free market alone are education and training. The reason for this is that education and training does not benefit only those individuals who consume it. Educated individuals produce collective benefits. This is true both for general education as well as for work-orientated education and training. For example, a democratic society will operate more effectively if its members are well educated about how the social and economic systems function. And work-orientated training benefits not only the individual who is able to earn higher wages with his improved skills, but also all those who work with the individual and who are more productive because they are working with someone with higher skills. So suppliers of education and training will not be able to capture the full benefits that their service provides to society. Free riding will prevent them from capturing benefits that spill over to others. As for defence, this will undermine the provision of an adequate level of education and training unless government intervenes.</p>
<p>This failure of free markets to organise an appropriate level of education for members of the society is made significantly worse by a number of additional factors. In a free market, many individuals will not earn sufficient money to buy even the education that is in their own best interests, will be too young when education is of greatest benefit to them to make an informed decision about its value, and will not have sufficient education or information to make sensible educational choices. As a result, a society that leaves the provision of general or work-orientated education to the market will be significantly less productive as a whole. It will be less competitive economically than other societies that educate their members better.</p>
<p>Markets alone will also fail to establish programs and services that can improve the quality of life of all who live in a community or society. Policing, the provision of safe and well-planned public areas such as parks and streets, and programs that reduce crime by rehabilitating drug addicts or by providing satisfying activities for teenagers all have beneficial collective effects that cannot be targeted only at those who are willing to pay for them. No matter how beneficial these sorts of programs may be to a community, a free market will not provide them. A neighbourhood, a city, or a region can disintegrate socially, and the market system will not do anything about it.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#:~:text=Another%20very%20important,anything%20about%20it.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Market systems alone will also fail to produce the best outcomes when individuals do not capture all the harmful effects of their actions. Again, this will occur most commonly when the production and use of goods and services have collective effects that go beyond the producer and the consumer. For example, the production of a good might have harmful effects on the environment, disadvantaging many others. But there is nothing in a free market system that requires the producer to compensate those disadvantaged by the pollution he causes. Neither he nor the consumer will pay the price for these harmful effects on others. As a result, the market does not give them any incentive to limit these harmful effects.</p>
<p>In fact, if the producer can manufacture an item more cheaply by a process that degrades the environment, he will have to use this process if he is to stay in business. A producer who is bound by a belief system that prevents him from harming others and who therefore refuses to pollute, will go out of business. He will have to use more expensive non-polluting processes and charge higher prices, and will be out-competed in the market place.</p>
<p>It is critically important to note this destructive feature of the way markets operate. It is not just that economic markets fail to produce optimal outcomes in circumstances where they fail to ensure that individuals capture the benefits or harms of their actions. They also actually prevent individuals from behaving in ways that would correct these market failures. Individuals or firms who try to do so will be out-competed and go out of business. The competition that ensures that consumers get goods and services at the cheapest price is a two-edged sword. It destructively ensures that individuals and firms cannot take into account the factors that the market does not, even where it would advantage the community or society greatly if they did so. A firm cannot stay in business in a perfectly competitive market if it refuses to pollute, or if, as a contribution to society, it educates its employees beyond what is needed solely for the operation of the firm, or if it implements programs that produce enormous collective benefits to the community as a whole. Effective free markets make morality impossible. And the only individuals or firms who are able to accumulate great wealth in a competitive market are those who pursue only their own financial interests, and are not prevented from doing so by any conflicting moral code or religious beliefs.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#:~:text=Market%20systems%20alone,or%20religious%20beliefs.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;A further major limitation of economic markets is that they satisfy the needs only of those who have money. Markets have an extraordinary ability to efficiently meet the needs and desires of those who have purchasing power. But they will provide absolutely nothing to those who have none. If you do not have sufficient money to buy the food you need to live, the market will do nothing to help you as you starve to death. If you have a curable but potentially fatal illness, and do not have the money to pay for a cure, the market will let you die.

<p>&quot;Competition amongst the producers of goods and services drives down their profit margins. No one makes much money out of businesses that are subject to strong competition. In areas of business where anyone can get the knowledge and capital to operate, competition in a free market system will force down profits to subsistence levels. This is commonly the case where there is no regulation of taxi services, corner shops, street vendors and other small businesses. It is only in circumstances where vigorous and open competition does not exist to drive down profitability that great wealth can be accumulated and that the massively unequal distribution of wealth found in modern market economies emerges. It is only when there are business opportunities that most people are unable to exploit that very high incomes are produced.</p>
<p>For example, professionals of various types have been able to obtain high incomes by building themselves shelters from free and open competition. If a licence is required to practice the profession, and barriers are put in the way of gaining the licence, such as by limiting the number of training opportunities, competition can be avoided and high incomes assured.</p>
<p>The wealthy have much greater access to economic opportunities that are sheltered from competition. As a result, it is much easier for the wealthy to perpetuate their wealth or to increase it. Wealth opens up many income-earning opportunities that are not open to those without wealth. For example, it enables a person to get involved in much larger-scale business opportunities because they have much easier access to finance. And the wealthy are able to purchase exclusive educational opportunities for their children that shelter them from strong competition. The great majority of people are in no position to compete with the wealthy for these opportunities. As we will consider in detail later in this Chapter, the wealthy can also use the power that goes with their wealth to get governments and other rulers to manage the society in ways that favour them, including by further sheltering their businesses from competition.</p>
<p>In these cases, it is clear that great wealth can be produced and maintained only because the market fails to work effectively. If the market could organise competition successfully in these circumstances, incomes and prices would fall, and the needs of consumers would be satisfied more efficiently.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#:~:text=Competition%20amongst%20the,satisfied%20more%20efficiently.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The tendency of market systems to concentrate great wealth and economic power in a small number of individuals and corporations results in a further major limitation in the effectiveness of markets. Enough wealth can give individuals and corporations the power to influence the government or other ruler who manages the society and the market. As we shall see in detail later in this Chapter, even in democratic societies the wealthy are able to play a major role in determining who gets elected to govern and how long they stay in office. This power gives the wealthy the potential to bias the management of the market so that it operates in their favour. Markets include the seeds of their own destruction.

<p>&quot;There are many ways in which economically-powerful individuals and corporations can use the power of government for their own benefit. They can get the government or other ruler to grant and enforce a limited number of exclusive rights to exploit particular business opportunities or to provide particular services. For example, governments often place restrictions on who can use land in particular ways, set up television and radio broadcasting stations, enter particular professions, catch fish commercially in certain areas, run lotteries and casinos, and import particular types of goods. Because the people given these opportunities are protected from full competition, they can make above-normal profits.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#:~:text=There%20are%20many,above%2Dnormal%20profits.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;More directly, economically-powerful individuals, corporations and interest groups can influence governments to give them special tax breaks, more lenient controls on pollution, exemption from laws that set minimum wages and safety requirements, subsidies, and protection from competition by imports. And they can get the government to ensure that the tax system leaves them with many opportunities to avoid tax. Modern governments typically claim that their tax system collects a higher proportion of the incomes of the wealthy. A tax system that does this is essential if governments are to counter the tendencies of markets to concentrate most of the wealth in the hands of a small minority. But the wealthy can use their influence over governments to ensure that the tax laws that are claimed to do this are, in practice, ineffective and unenforceable. Typically in modern countries, the wealthy with their accountants and lawyers can find and exploit loop holes in the tax laws faster than governments close them. Increasingly, modern governments have used this as a justification for moving towards flat rate taxation systems such as consumption taxes. But there is no technical reason why governments cannot reform their legal system in ways that ensure that the wealthy pay the tax it is claimed they should. However, it is not in the interests of governments to do this.</p>
<p>The usefulness to the wealthy of a legal system that can be manipulated by costly lawyers and accountants points to a more general way in which the economically powerful can bias market systems in their favour. If the legal system that enforces the framework of laws that govern markets is very expensive to use, and if persons are more likely to get a favourable result the more money they spend, the legal system will be less effective at regulating and controlling the behaviour of the wealthy. If the economically powerful are able to escape the framework of laws, they will no longer be restricted to pursuing their self-interest in ways that benefit the society. And they will have a competitive advantage over the majority who cannot escape the laws.</p>
<p>A legal system also will be biased toward the economically powerful if the law is extremely complex, there are many opportunities for appeal, the outcome of each step in the legal process is uncertain and unpredictable, and the best legal advice and representation is very costly. Each of these characteristics make it easier for those with the most financial resources to achieve a favourable result from the legal system, and harder for the majority of citizens to do so. With such a system, the economically powerful do not have to bias the legal process in their favour by risky bribery of the judiciary. Instead, the complexity and expense of the system will ensure that only they can afford to do the things that are likely to deliver a favourable result.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#:~:text=More%20directly%2C%20economically,a%20favourable%20result.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The benefits to the economically powerful of co-opting the power of governments and other rulers in these ways are enormous. Throughout history, alliances with rulers have always been the royal road to riches for those who would be wealthy. It has been far easier to accumulate and preserve great wealth in this way than by continually out-competing others in a fair and vigorous market.</p>
<p>Somewhat paradoxically, the same self-interest that makes markets so efficient also motivates the economically powerful to use the power of governments to undermine markets. As we have seen, participants in a market do not have to care about the interests of others to want to strive to produce goods and services that satisfy the needs of others. Because the market enables them to capture the benefits of their effects on others, self-interested participants will be driven to satisfy others, even though they care only about their own interests. The market can organise complex cooperation even though participants have no interest in being cooperative or in making the market system work. Participants just pursue their own narrow interests wherever they lie, wherever that takes them.</p>
<p>But this strength of the market system is also the source of its greatest weakness. Individuals and corporations that are ruthlessly self-interested will flourish in a market system and will benefit others as they benefit themselves. But when they accumulate sufficient economic power to manipulate governments, they will do so. The fact that this will prevent the market from efficiently exploiting the benefits of cooperation will be immaterial to them. They will not give a dam. Cooperation and the interests of others are not their concern in their business activities. They will not be interested at all in whether or not they undermine the market. Their only consideration in planning where to direct their energies is how to gain the most benefits for themselves. If this is achieved best by manipulating market rules, that is what they will do. Whether they put their energies and talents into following the rules that regulate the market, or by circumventing or biasing the rules, depends only on which alternative produces the greatest returns to themselves.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#_ednref10:~:text=The%20benefits%20to,returns%20to%20themselves.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Individuals and groups who have the capacity to use mental models to understand how their society is manipulated by the wealthy are able to see that it is in their interests to put a stop to it. But to end the manipulation, they have to acquire sufficient power to overcome the power of the ruler and of those who support him. Throughout history, citizens have usually been able to achieve this only when large numbers of them have been willing to band together to overthrow the ruler by force. But individuals have not generally been prepared to risk their lives in this way unless they had little to lose and unless they believed that the revolution could install new rulers and perhaps a new way of organising the society that would significantly advance their interests.</p>
<p>These conditions were not often met. It is in the interests of rulers and those who benefit from their rule to manage the society in a way that makes successful revolt unlikely. A ruler could ensure that poverty would not be experienced by sufficient numbers of the society to threaten his rule. And the ruler could promote ideologies and beliefs that suggested that his rule was the best or even the only practicable way of organising an acceptable society, despite any poverty, misery, and inequality it produced[11]. To the extent that these beliefs were promoted successfully, the mental models of members of society would not enable them to foresee any better way of organising society. And the more widely these beliefs were accepted, the greater the inequalities in wealth that could be suffered without risking revolution. The ruler and his associates could take a greater share of the wealth of the society without endangering their continued power.</p>
<p>But the task of promoting these beliefs became more difficult as members of many human societies developed an improved ability to model and understand more complex processes and systems. As humans accumulated knowledge and shared it through books and education, more individuals were able to mentally model how their society functioned, and could see how it might be organised differently. Increasingly, the members of many societies were able to see that there was no basis for the doctrines that were used by their rulers to justify their absolute power. Their rule was not divinely sanctioned, and they were not infallible. And more and more could see reasonable ways in which their rulers could be controlled to ensure they ruled in the interests of the majority. Revolts and threats of revolts progressively resulted in more effective restrictions on those who managed and governed many human societies. Increasingly, these restrictions realigned the interests of the ruler with those of the ruled, and made it more difficult for narrower interests to manipulate the power of the ruler for their own ends.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#_ednref10:~:text=Individuals%20and%20groups,their%20own%20ends.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Of course, in democratic societies as in any other human society, it will be in the interests of the economically powerful to do what they can to get governments to advance the interests of the wealthy. The economically powerful will benefit enormously if they can find ways to do this. But a government in a democratic society can serve the interests of the wealthy only if it can still maintain the support of a majority. If this is to occur, the majority must be convinced that a government that serves the interests of the wealthy is in fact serving the interests of the majority. To achieve this, the wealthy must influence the ideas and beliefs used by the majority to build their mental models of how the society functions. The mental models of the majority must lead them to conclude that the actions of such a government is in their interests.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this is no easy task. But the economically powerful are in a special position to be able to influence the ideas and beliefs that members of a society use in their mental models. Their wealth gives them control over most of the resources of the society. Most of the newspapers, television stations, and other media are owned by wealthy individuals and corporations. The economically powerful are major funders of universities and research institutes, and can determine the reputation of a university by deciding the employability of its graduates. Most of the members of modern societies are dependent directly or indirectly on the economically powerful for continued employment. Individuals who have and promote radically different views on how society should be organised have always had difficulty in obtaining well-paid employment in democratic as well as communist countries. IBM does not employ anybody in a senior position who uses his ‘personal’ time to campaign actively against multi-national companies, warning how they corrupt governments and undermine free markets. And political parties must obtain substantial financial contributions from wealthy individuals and corporations if they are to organise the large-scale election campaigns that are essential for electoral success in large modern nation states. These essential contributions will dry up if a political party promotes ideas and beliefs that offend the economically powerful.</p>
<p>The use of these opportunities to influence the nature of the ideas and beliefs that are treated as respectable in a society does not require any coordinated conspiracy on the part of the economically powerful. Any detailed cooperation amongst the wealthy as a group is undermined by free riding and cheating just as it is within any other large group of self-interested individuals. But the wealthy have a common interest in defending the enormously unequal distribution of wealth that has enabled them to accumulate and retain their riches. And they can exercise a substantial degree of influence without any significant self-sacrifice or investment of resources. It requires little extra investment for the wealthy to use their existing economic power to influence public debate. In the ways described, the economically powerful can determine the ideas and beliefs that are repeated and treated seriously in the mass media, that attract research funding, that are supported by expert opinion from universities and research institutes, are adopted by political parties, and are publicly supported by citizens who wish to remain in well-paid employment. And they can determine which ideas and beliefs will be quickly dismissed, ridiculed and, if necessary, demonised.</p>
<p>This manipulation of public ideas and beliefs is able to take advantage of the fact that most members of modern societies have not yet developed an effective capacity for systemic modelling. They cannot form complex mental models that enable them to predict how their society functions and how it would change under different conditions. Most members of modern societies have a limited capacity to evaluate for themselves even the simple models that are continually repeated and promoted in the public media. They have even less ability to develop for themselves more complex and more accurate models of how their economic system operates and how it could be improved. The simple economic models that are promoted through the public media serve the same function as the religious and moral beliefs that were used by rulers in earlier times to retain the support of their citizens. Just like a belief that the ruler is a god, or is chosen by the gods, the simple models allow the governors to pay less regard to the interests of the governed.</p>
<p>The economically powerful will ensure that simple models that advance their interests are repeated publicly and treated as authoritative. Typically these models show by simple chains of cause and effect that actions which favour those with economic power also help the less wealthy. They show that actions that would disadvantage the wealthy would also disadvantage the majority. In most democratic nation states at the turn of the 20th century, citizens are continually presented with simple models of these kinds. They are told that the way to reduce unemployment and to increase the living standards of the majority is to reduce minimum wages and working conditions, decrease social security benefits, and provide incentives to business through subsidies and tax concessions.</p>
<p>Citizens are continually shown how globalisation has made it impossible to collect much tax off large corporations and the wealthy without damaging the economy. This would cause a flight of capital that would increase unemployment and reduce living standards. They are told that countries cannot now afford the welfare and social security systems that in the 20th century have prevented the misery and the poverty that unmanaged capitalism produced for many in the 19th century. As the need arises, simple models are rapidly developed and promoted to show that anything done to directly help the poor will in fact harm them, the only way to help the poor is to help the rich, and anything that harms the rich will hurt the poor. And whatever crisis emerges in the society and its economic system, whatever its cause, simple models are soon developed to show that the crisis arose because workers’ wages are too high, or because welfare schemes are too generous.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to develop simple models of this type that have a surface plausibility. In a complex society most actions have a multitude of effects, some of which will advantage a particular group, some of which will not. Any action that advantages the wealthy will probably also have some effects that advantage the poor, as well as some that harm the poor. It is a simple matter to construct models that highlight only the causal chains that suit a particular argument. Such a model will not be wrong because of what it contains, but because of what it leaves out. The logical and causal connections used by the model will be valid. But minds that cannot model the complexity that has been left out of the simple model will not be able to see that the model is inadequate and manipulative.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/16.htm#_ednref10:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20in,inadequate%20and%20manipulative.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;The only actions of governments that can survive global competition will be those that make their producers more competitive in the market. All other management activities, including those that are needed to correct the deficiencies of the market, will be undermined. Unchecked, this would eventually return us to the unmanaged markets of the nineteenth century, and the widespread misery, poverty and inequality that they produced.</p>
<p>The only way in which this process can be stopped is by some form of global governance. Individuals, corporations and nations are powerless to prevent the disintegration of society that unmanaged markets will produce. Even if nobody in the world wants it, unmanaged global markets will continue to undermine national government. Anything a nation does to counter the process will simply make business within the country less competitive. Only global governance can end the competition between national governments that is eroding their ability to correct the deficiencies of the market. Global governance is essential to establish and enforce minimum global standards for wages, working hours, and social security. Only the power of global governance can prevent countries from undercutting these minimum standards and continuing the downward spiral into environmental and social disintegration that is being produced by unmanaged global competition. Global governance can establish minimum standards of living to provide a floor from which business competes in all countries of the world.</p>
<p>Just as the misery produced by unmanaged markets in the nineteenth century made the modern welfare state inevitable, the misery produced by unmanaged global markets will make global governance inevitable. The only unanswered question is how much misery will be produced before global governance is established.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/17.htm#:~:text=The%20only%20actions,governance%20is%20established.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But the majority of people on the planet do not yet have the knowledge or the ability to form mental models of how global markets operate and how various alternative forms of global and national governance would interact with those market systems. And the economically powerful are using their influence over public ideas to reinforce simpler and less adequate models. These models point to the evils rather that the benefits of national and global governance. It is in the immediate interests of the wealthy to support the dismantling of the social security and other programs of national governments. They do not need these programs. Their wealth enables them to satisfy their own needs, and to avoid the effects of social disintegration. But governments currently make them contribute to the funding of the programs through their taxes. The wealthy have the most to lose from attempts by governments to redistribute income and to correct other failings of markets. In many industrialised countries, the wealthy have pursued their interests by using the harmful effects of global competition to gain support for dismantling the welfare state even more quickly than the market would have required.</p>
<p>In the long run, however, the economically powerful will see that effective global governance is as essential to their interests as were effective systems of national governance earlier this century. Large-scale social unrest is as inevitably a consequence of unmanaged global markets as it was of the unmanaged market systems of the nineteenth century. And this social disintegration will eventually threaten the interests of the economically powerful, as it did earlier this century. Eventually, it will be clear to all that global governance is essential to correct the disadvantages of the global market.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/17.htm#:~:text=But%20the%20majority,the%20global%20market.">source</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But, as we have seen, our existing systems of governance will not do this efficiently and effectively. Our existing forms of government are incompetent. Where governments have competed directly with markets in the organisation of economic activity, governments have proved inadequate. The same deficiencies in government that make it inferior to the market also limit its ability to organise the features of society that markets cannot. As we have seen, governments lack the information they need to manage a complex society effectively. They also must rely on incompetent bureaucracies to design and implement their policies. And their interests are often not aligned with the interests of the society as a whole.</p>
<p>Management is essential to produce an effective, cooperative planetary society. But our current forms of government are seriously limited in their ability to discover and adapt the management that is needed. If humanity is to fulfil its evolutionary potential, it must discover new and better processes for establishing the various levels of governance. The development of a managed planetary society is not enough. The next great evolutionary challenge for humanity will be to invent a new form of governance that will overcome the serious flaws in our existing processes.</p>
<p>We need a system that is as superior to current governance as is the market. We need a system for establishing and evolving governance that is as dynamic and evolvable as the market. It must be superior at discovering better forms of governance, and at adapting them as circumstances change. Highly evolvable management is essential if we are to have a highly evolvable human society.&quot; - <a href="http://users.tpg.com.au/users/jes999/17.htm#:~:text=But%2C%20as%20we,evolvable%20human%20society.">source</a></p>

<p>&quot;Taken together, these collective actions of producers and consumers operate a supra-individual change-and-test mechanism that can discover better goods and services. The mechanism can do this even though no individual within the market knows which products will prove to be better. As a result, the market is more effective at matching goods and services to the needs of citizens than any group of central planners, or any producer acting alone. And the entire process operates through individuals pursuing only their own immediate interests.</p>
<p>Is it possible to establish similar processes to produce and adapt the functions currently performed by government? Could governance be established by supra-individual change-and-test processes that continually search for and implement better governance?

<!-- The global digital / unified / singular firehose -->
<p>One way to look at Headjack is as a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> messaging network where accounts, message types, tags, application sources &amp; <a href="data_legos.html#event-streams">anything within documents</a> can be treated as topics to subscribe to - a multidimensional notification highway.

<p>When compared to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/intro">Kafka</a>: it provides only logical addressing (allowing for the storage layer to evolve &amp; migrate data seamlessly) and delegates the data availability (storage &amp; retrievability) of the actual documents/events to the entities in the ecosystem (users/IDMs/applications/archives) on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery">best-effort</a> basis without guarantees (but with <a href="store_and_retrieve.html#how-to-retrieve-data-for-a-random-uri">multiple ways for retrieving data for a URI</a>).</p>

<p>In the Metaverse entities will connect &amp; interact with information under a common global namespace &amp; surf the web through competing applications &amp; views that present &amp; filter commonly addressable data in any way imaginable. It will be built on top of a layered stack of technologies &amp; open protocols and <u><strong>underneath everything sit Headjack's primitives: identity, authorization &amp; content addressing</strong></u>. All events can &amp; will be interlinked, tied to identity &amp; made easily referencable. Anything can be built &amp; made composable &amp; interoperable on top of these building blocks as long as they don't impose any constraints - no more walled gardens. Furthermore, the Metaverse is mostly about agency in creation - transaction, exchange &amp; finance are not at the forefront and will be handled by other layers &amp; protocols like generalized smart contract chains &amp; NFTs.</p>

<p>synthesis</p>
<p>this book perhaps holds the world record for number of quotes - it speaks through them.</p>
<p>The web is broken on many fronts - this chapter explores many problematic aspects and how they can be completely solved or at least improved. Headjack's paradigm is an architectural reset of the web &amp; opens doors to things which weren't possible before.</p>
<p>Not all combinations will be possible due to 3 reasons: complexity for users, a combinatorial explosion in computation and technical feasibility. But a meaningful set of never-before-seen functionality will emerge and it will have the capacity to evolve gradually to any other subset.</p>
<p>You don't have to agree with everything - even we're not 100% sold on all ideas presented here. But its worth exploring possibilities and expanding the frontier of possibility.</p>

<p>The same document may be published through different platforms and because of the host-certified web of today it will get multiple different URLs. Discussion around it becomes fragmented &amp; shallow in the different platforms with separate comment sections and there isn't a way to de-duplicate &amp; unify it.

<li>No clear rules for moderation &amp; censorship - the terms of service are ambiguous and an ever moving goal post. Platform accountability is practically non-existent:
<ul>
<li>account reach can be down-regulated through opaque techniques like <a href="https://shadowban.yuzurisa.com/">shadow banning</a></li>
<li>accounts can be removed subjectively (case in point: earlier Twitter accounts tracking Nancy Pelosi's public stock trades)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no way for users to &quot;fork&quot; a Reddit community if they no longer agree with the way moderation is happening - they have to recreate a new subreddit from scratch.</li>
<li>There is no market for solving certain types of spam such as financial scams - Twitter &amp; YouTube are riddled with templatized messages and their internal <a href="TODO.html#vertical-integration-vs-specialization--competition">vertically integrated</a> teams are unable to deal with yet another problem in a world-class manner.

<p>But this can be pushed a lot further - using public <a href="messages.html">message types</a> more specific preferences within one application (and compatible with others) could be signaled. The choice of recommendation algorithms, filtration criteria &amp; moderation levels could be displayed in account profiles throughout all applications either as badges or in some other way.

Aside from the scalability properties rollups can possess, they also solve both fundamental problems. Rollups don’t need their own validators, only a set of sequencers to produce blocks. The base layer provides the secure validator set. Rollups that share a settlement layer can build trust-minimized bridges between them because their state transitions can be easily verified through the settlement layer.

Why not a rollup? There is nothing to steal - there will not be 100x times TVL more than the mcap of the protocol

The more I think about it, the less need I see to try to attach my chain to Ethereum - it will not benefit from financial liquidity & interoperability since its focus is quite different and it will most likely require it's own token for PoS consensus

A big reason to want to attach to Ethereum is securely bridged financial liquidity so my use case will benefit a lot less from trying to integrate with Eth because of it's non-financial use case

No composability is broken if not linked to ethereum & is sharded - as is the case with financial blockchains

I think that because this is not a very financial use case that the incentive to link it strongly with Ethereum is smaller.

finance cares mostly about the present whereas an index is there to provide information about the past - different data availability & retrievability needs
the historical part is much more important - each block & the hashes that are contained in there - or they should enter the state...

- eth2 danksharding?

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3542/how-are-ethereum-addresses-generated

Ethereum uses a specific signature scheme called ECDSA on a specific elliptic curve called Secp256k1.
the address is the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key.

This ensures that most apps do not end up hosting ECDSA key pairs which create security and regulatory challenges if funds are sent to them on Ethereum.

<p>CHALLENGES !!!</p>
<!--

TODO:

mark concerns with some color or shape that are not just relevant to headjack but any decentralized solution

other protocols also suffer from this - how do you update an element identifiable with a hash?

Concern: might be prohibitively expensive to maintain different versions of feeds for the dame account based on different applications and what they “support”

concern: a complete mess of message types with overlapping functionality

The limiting factor: data processing & computation

IDMs as single points of failure

data problem: separate sets of indexes from different infrastructure companies? in case someone is spammy and infra company X doesn't want to work with them? We can still have some sort of federated queries.

Todo: how to combat brigading? Concern: might not be able to do it because not a single system
swarming

not all business models translate easily:
Starting today, Twitter will share ad revenue with creators for ads that appear in their reply threads
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621544497388875777

Concern: it will never be possible to display an accurate view count like twitter can (what about youtube?)

concern: harder to implement recommendation algorithms & feeds for public content and content that's shared only to some group (and there are different such groups) - currently Twitter has a gods-eye view and access to everything that's public and also shared only with those that have hidden their content for outsiders of their graph - in a much more fractured world this could be a lot messier & harder

not being able to hide the like counter - bad for mental health?

mistakes such as doing some action publicly when intended for a private action...

algorithmic interference - even if you've chosen a good algorithm, it may be using signals from others who are using worse algorithms and thus the worse algorithms are influencing the better one

what if an application generates too much data for the infrastructure companies to process and are relying on their own - how to unify queries & indexes across infrastructures?

<h1 id="data-problems"><a class="header" href="#data-problems">Data problems</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Proofs for individual documents for a URI might be quite big - if there are 1 million events by all users in a blob that a big application anchors with a single commit (realistic for something like Twitter if it anchors once every 10 seconds), then we'd need about 20 hashes (log(1000000)) in a binary Merkle tree in order to prove the authenticity of any individual element. Suppose an event is just a simple reaction - probably less than 100 bytes including everything necessary. With 32 byte hashes we would end up with 0.64kb just for the proof of inclusion in the blob with 1 million elements which is at least 6.4 times larger than the data itself.
<ul>
<li>This isn't a problem for infrastructure companies that store the entire data blobs or the applications that publish them as there's enormous overlap in the proofs for the elements witin a blob (so the proof overhead will be less that the entire blob itself and it can even be entirely skipped as the proofs can be re-generated), but entities like IDMs that want to cache individual elements for their users out of the aggregate blobs will have to store a lot more data.</li>
<li>A possible way to reduce the size of proofs is to use much wider trees (not binary but with a branching factor of up to 1024, or maybe even more!) with KZG vector commitments - they allow us to prove that an element is part of a set with a small constant size proof - without having to provide the hashes of all sister elements. Ethereum will be moving to a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/06/18/verkle.html">Verkle tree</a> structure for the same reasons - reducing the depth of the tree and the size of proofs for individual elements. 1 million elements can be represented with a tree with a branching factor of 1000 and depth 2 and only 2 KZG proofs would be required to prove the inclusion of any element. However, it's not clear what the performance costs would be when uzing KZG commitments (or their size) - <u><strong>this should be researched.</strong></u></li>

== stupid stuff START ==

what if messages contain always the hash of the newest block - the chain tip? If the message is signed by the application (so the user doesn't have to) and the hash of the chain tip is included then you can prove that this message was created at least at that point in time - not earlier. And then you can look for invalidations of the access tokens / permissions for that app to post on behalf of the user. Similar to Farcaster - the message was created and signed at some point (or later), but ..... fuck, this doesn't work :|

what if apps had to occasionally commit sets of messages that have been published in the past X number of blocks (with some IDs), such that we can later check if a message was forged much later (after an access token revocation) and "inserted" at a prior time? what if apps had a nonce that gets incremented for every message they publish - forever? ... fuck, this doesn't work :|

what if KZG vector commitments can help? with a tree with a branching factor of 1000 for 1B elements we'd need only 1 million KZG proofs

what if we separated the inclusion (merkle) proofs from the publishing of data? what if we just published the IPFS CID of the blob (which could have a tree structure & header & so on) and also the application nonce (new type of nonce), but the inclusion proofs were submitted separately in an even more compact way? any benefits in that?

what if apps maintain 2 separate sets of inclusion proofs - the original ones, & those that I'm thinking of in here?

<ul>
<li>Edits/updates or deleting a document will result in a different URI - the original URI/document are unaffected. This means that all infra &amp; apps will have to monitor the network for updates of elements but some might miss it because an update may come from anywhere - not necessarily from the original application that posted the event.
<ul>
<li>One option is whenever an edit/update/delete is made, the application that's used to generate it would have to explicitly notify the IDM of the user (and maybe also the original application) that there's been an update. The IDM may keep a compact map of document URIs that have had changes and point to the URI of the latest version of those documents (but no intermediate versions) without any proofs. All updates should always refer to the URI of the original version of an event. However, there are 3 problems with this: <strong>1)</strong> if the IDM doesn't check the authenticity of the edits/updates it may be fooled into thinking that the user has changed something, <strong>2)</strong> an application might not inform the IDM, <strong>3)</strong> this will lead to additional storage requirements for IDMs, and <strong>4)</strong> this will lead to a lot of traffic &amp; requests from all kinds of applications to IDMs just to check if there's been an update for a document before visualizing it. <u><strong>A better solution is needed.</strong></u></li>

<ul>
<li>State growth - Headjack keeps a lot of the history in its materialized state in order to guarantee historic data availability so that anyone can generate proofs for older events - not just the &quot;current view&quot; (which also constantly grows because of more and more accounts). However, most of this is compact integers (block ranges for ownership &amp; authorizations, nonce mappings, etc.) and growth will not be very high - should be well below that of Solana even with billions of accounts. If necessary, history older than some threshold (a decade?) could be pruned - older documents with already generated &amp; cached proofs will be self-authenticating and other services could provide archival nodes without pruned history as well.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Some applications might depend too much on specific indexes that can be maintained cost-effectively only by the biggest infrastructure companies and that way they may end up locked-in with nowhere else to go.</p>

<li>
<p>IDMs &amp; applications could lock-in users by not adhering to the standards for interoperable data &amp; messages by offering custom features, but this problem exists on the web today as well with other open protocols and a strong culture of checking if interoperability is maintained can counteract this.</p>

<p>Social graphs &amp; DMs are facilitated by <a href="IDM.html">IDMs</a> which resemble <a href="others_list.html#farcaster">Farcaster</a>'s managed hosts and <a href="others_list.html#bluesky">Bluesky</a>'s Personal Data Servers - a centralization point with some trust assumptions and potential for data breaches. However, this is the best tradeoff that would allow for true mass adoption and is still a massive improvement to the status quo. A big failure scenario is if an IDM that manages millions of accounts goes rogue or shuts down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those that have not bound a keypair to their accounts will effectively be stuck.</li>
<li>The chain could get congested by those who have keypairs and suddenly all at once start submitting on-chain transactions directly to move to another IDM but that problem can be alleviated through <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/an-off-chain-bls-aggregation-scheme-which-might-reduce-the-casper-finalization-to-1-min/5427">signature aggregation</a> if the signed payload is the same like for example if a big chunk of them move from IDM <code>666</code> to IDM <code>42</code> specifically.
<ul>
<li>If they haven't exported their off-chain data managed by their previous IDM it could be lost - social graph, DMs, preferences, etc.</li>
<li>However, these problems (loss from a &quot;trusted&quot; service going down and network congestion on rare events) will be shared by any solution that has &quot;trusted&quot; services that are required to reach any meaningful scale. Some users could run their own version of an IDM for their private data but they'll have to pay for more bytes on-chain which is not something that everyone could be doing at once.</li>

<p>Updates &amp; deletes to content may not be applied/displayed properly in all applications - there will always be those that don't honor edits or <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/adx/blob/main/architecture.md#purge-requests-hard-removal">purge requests</a>. However, this is a problem with almost any decentralized protocol and most established applications will be honoring these types of messages or else people will simply move to different ones. In the end, this will not be an issue on any meaningful scale as social forces will solve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data pointed to by a URI is not by itself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">self-authenticating</a> - it needs accompanying cryptographic Merkle proofs that only full blockchain nodes can generate. However, no solution provides fully self-authenticating content as keypairs might have changed - there will always be a need to consult with a <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically centralized</a> entity. Also archiving &amp; bookmarking services (or fully self-contained articles/books with no external dependencies) that don't want to rely on repetitive requests to the blockchain in the future may request these proofs initially and store them along with the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what happens if an event that's not anchored yet becomes illegitimate by an IDM unauthorizing an application before the content is anchored? Confusing for people...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the unlimited amount &amp; combinatorial explosion of customization &amp; preferences might be too expensive for the infrastructure to support them</p>

<p>changing something from public to private and the other way around</p>

<li>
<p>what happens if some new application is very spammy? should the infra just pay the costs for storage by default?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what if a specific application is very spammy and infrasturcture blacklists it, but some users use it and expect their creations &amp; edits to be visible elsewhere?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>concern: its impossible to have updated views &amp; indexes for every aggregate with a big enough different filtration criteria, but its important for any view to be possible, so that eventually it gets calculated &amp; surfaces</p>

having everything from a user in a tree with a root hash - easier replication

routing endpoints for accounts - advertised by their IDMs

giving different types of permissions to IDMs - for example the ability to change your name without a sig from you

2 types of edit commands: non-branching and branching
what if IDMs allow us to have pointers like HEAD in git?

friendship should be: you have a DM channel open - without a filter

apps can ask IDMs for state diffs for their users
what if idms had a protocol for being asked for "what's new since block X" - and them being able to give a merkle tree diff showing the changed elements and a list of the new elements (as URIs)

IDMs could be responsible for producing "streams" of the user activity - by simply referencing all activity from other applications (applications either need to notify the IDMs or IDMs need to monitor everything - for private data they probably need to be explicitly notified?)

Today, advertisers blast and drip communications to users in hope of capturing attention at the right time. Tomorrow, advertisers can place a price on the cost of a message and pass along an embedded financial incentive for users to read it. We can imagine dynamic inboxes in the future where value can be attached to messages, and mail/messaging apps can automatically push value-laden messages to the top of the inbox. Inboxes themselves can monetize out of these rules, and give users flexibility to select filters or configurations that work while allowing advertisers to target high-value users.

These are [accounts](accounts.md) that can grant the ability to applications to post on behalf of accounts that are under the control of the ACM in question.



Identity managers can still be compromised and wreck havok, but this is an improvement to the status quo
TODO: problem: what happens if an ACM with control of millions of accounts stops behaving properly?
- users without keypairs are screwed
- users with keypairs will be sending on-chain messages but those will be huge and will clog the network
    - possible solution: batch them off-chain into 1000 batches, construct BLS aggregate sigs, sign a msg & transmit that along with a bitmap for which keys participated in the batching to a block.
    Users will need to coordinate off-chain & decide from which block to revoke the access, which other ACM should be approved, etc. This can be used in other scenarios too.

- maybe they should not be properties of accounts but a separate map structure that just maps handles to IDs and on which block were they acquired? What would be traded - handles on IDs?

    maybe the protocol should lease whole TLDs to the highest bidders?


an improvement over DNS & the TTL (usually 30 minutes) for the nameservers
improvement also because records can be checked with a proof - not just blindly trusting a TLD/authoritative nameserver

handles can be sold without affecting the interest graph - handles are not accounts.
entire accounts can be also sold with the transition to a new keypair

gradually lowering the cost for new handles, such that it costs 10k$ initially for a handle, and going lower slowly.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack

UTF-8 support for handles opens handle users up to homograph attacks, not to mention case-sensitivity issues. This issue is of ongoing discussion both for the DSNP as well as in for ICANN domain names and other projects working with internationalization support.

**Register** 
Users acquire a name by making two transactions — the first is to commit a secret hash of the username, and the second is to reveal the secret and claim the username to the address. During the reveal phase it also:

commit-reveal scheme prevents frontrunning

- giving/leasing the names properly & orderly is a hard problem

https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/12/14/idn-is-crazy/

when having multiple names, an account should specify their preferred one - possibly as a message type


ens is not enough - one size fits all aint good


Off-chain namespaces for handles? Dot something to be off-chain?
Offchain name registry

names should have an index and that index can be reused in different "TLDs" - alex.eth & alex.com - alex can be identified by the same number so that TXs are small


Names can have an index and subdomains can refer to the names by idx - vbuterin should be in the state once even if rhere is a vbuterin.com and a vbuterin.eth - names are created once and reused by idx
