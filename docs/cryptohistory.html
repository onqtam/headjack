<p>The value of permanence &amp; self-authenticating documents - not host-centric/host-certified or anything else - truly self-authenticating!

The only way to make something truly self-authenticating in perpetuity is to timestamp it. Anchor it. Sequence a set inclusion commitment on-chain.</p>

<p>In the current web documents are <a href="host_centric.html#the-host-centric-web--its-decay">host-certified</a> and we refer to data by location instead of contents. Here we'll expand on problems with the status quo and list the benefits of building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">web of trust</a> at web-scale through <a href="host_vs_data_centric.html">data-centric</a> addressing &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-authenticating_document">self-authenticating</a> documents tied to identity.</p>
<!-- toc -->
<h1 id="authenticity"><a class="header" href="#authenticity">Authenticity</a></h1>
<p>We'll be able to computationally verify the authenticity of any document &amp; tie it to an identity as long as we also have the proofs for it - giving birth to the <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1459140902144729088">ledger of record</a> where argument from cryptography begins superseding argument from authority.</p>
<p>Anyone might have saved a specific document (&amp; updates to it) locally along with the necessary proofs for authenticity even if most infrastructure no longer stores/serves it. There is a <code>1 of N</code> guarantee which allows documents that someone wants buried to be passed around with proofs and resurface in the public at a later point - improving accountability.</p>
<!-- 
TODO:
In such an environment controversial and false claims are much easier to prove.
If even intranets and corps move to this addressing then whistpeblowing will be much more authentic. This is the mechanism for the biggest crimes to bubble up

The ability to do specific verifiable attribution to where a harm is coming from can increase our capacity to serve justice

> "Cryptographically verifiable history is the next step after written history" - [@balajis](https://youtu.be/VeH7qKZr0WI?t=10089)



We could establish global [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) through authenticity, reputation, and the ledger of record.

Another important aspect in improving coordination is to build applications that will help in forming common knowledge:

"The great privilege of the elites of the future will be to erase the computer information about them and assume their private identity again." - Marshall McLuhan

> "Common knowledge is often important for coordination. For example, a group of people might want to speak out about an issue, but only feel comfortable doing so if there’s enough of them speaking out at the same time that they have safety in numbers." [Vitalik](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html)


no mentioned "fact" shall remain unanchored/unreferenced - that's what stable URIs and intra-document addressing are for

<p>Headjack is a global <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control system</a> with different data availability tradeoffs - storage and retrievability are not guaranteed. If someone processes everything that's linked to the blockchain they'd be able to track the creation and changes of each document - both the edits from the original authors and the forks &amp; references from others, and also the sequence of authorizations that update who has authority to edit a document. All events are cryptographically sealed in time with on-chain commitments and the history cannot be tampered with.</p>
<p>We should be able to view the changes of any document with a diff view - similarly to what <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/18/the-wayback-machine-fighting-digital-extinction-in-new-ways/">The Internet Archive provides</a> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/diff/20170118202526/20170120040337/https://www.ice.gov/speeches">this as an example</a>) but with a lot more control and a wide range of different visualization tools - example: a slider for filtering/jumping through time <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/change-right-gutter-to-vertical-timeline-topic-controls/44096">like in Discourse</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;The public’s interest in seeing what’s changed—or at least being aware that a change has been made and why—is as legitimate as it is diffuse.

<p>We ought to rebuild everything on top of this <a href="cryptohistory.html#authenticity">ledger of record</a> - including Wikipedia (no more dead links!), open source code, science and peer review - under one global interlinked namespace where any public event is referencable so that others can comment on it.</p>

<p>In Headjack updates to URIs are broadcasted but the previous versions remain - applications ought to display the latest state but should allow browsing the entire history of changes - like using Git.</p>
<h1 id="deduplicating-documents--traceability"><a class="header" href="#deduplicating-documents--traceability">Deduplicating documents &amp; traceability</a></h1>
<p>An open paradigm with content addressing where data is shared between services would enable us to de-duplicate re-uploads as long as they are the same documents in terms of bytes because of the open nature of data - based on their hash. We'll be able to see when something first appeared &amp; the discussion will be much less fractured between platforms and posts - leading to greater depth.</p>
<p>We'll be able to more easily <a href="names_and_paths.html#addressing-within-content">address parts of documents</a> and share ranges of entire videos without having to re-upload them as separate clips which breaks the contextual link. If this becomes as easy as (or even easier than) it currently is to crop &amp; re-upload, then it will become the norm - we'll all prefer not losing the context. In this paradigm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake">deepfakes</a> will be easier to spot &amp; fight - tracing the source of content authentically to identity is important &amp; desirable.</p>
<p>TODO: regarding deepfakes - only official statements could be traced - unofficial leaks will still be unprovable</p>
<h1 id="verifiable-credentials"><a class="header" href="#verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a></h1>
<p>Entities can sign messages that attest facts about other accounts - the creation of such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a> doesn't have to happen on-chain - they can be issued off-chain with a message that's only anchored on-chain and has a URI. <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/06/12/nonfin.html#modifying-and-revoking-attestations"><code>&quot;issuance is common, revocation is rare&quot;</code></a> - later revocations &amp; updates can be handled in one of 2 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-chain revocation/updates: if the attestations are uniquely numbered with a counter from the issuer using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">nonce</a>, then the Headjack state can be extended to support a special <code>revocation list</code> field in which the chain can record revocations at specific blocks - then the validity of said attestations will be checkable with a single query to the blockchain state. For updates there would be a second list and in order to check the validity for an attestation after an update has been recorded for its nonce, users would need to fetch the off-chain anchored message corresponding to the update at the block at which it was flagged. The blockchain may charge periodic fees for state rent for these lists.</li>
<li>Fully off-chain: in which case there will be some liveness assumptions around the issuer for checking if an attestation has been revoked/updated.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>We don't need oracles, tokens, automatic on-chain settlement &amp; markets through smart contracts to build reputation systems for predictions &amp; promises - all we need is to immutably sequence predictive messages that are authentically linked to identity and plot the results - the open nature of the data would disincentivize platforms to display it incorrectly which is enough - we trust block explorers after all.</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/">Tipranks</a> platform as an example - we can generalize it for anyone in the world - not just for certified financial advisors. The reality is that millions of people are effectively guilty of shilling, despite some preficing it with the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenSpartan/status/1552968186605490176"><code>&quot;this is not financial advice&quot;</code></a>. We can self-regulate the crypto &amp; financial industries bottom-up in a decentralized way - steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>come up with the base set of extensible prediction message types</li>
<li>build the tools that plot predictions versus a price feed</li>
<li>demand that influencers use the specific types of messages for predictions</li>
<li>refuse to listen to accounts that don't use that format and build the habit to check track records before listening to someone - this can (and will) become a social norm</li>
<li>let the <a href="https://twitter.com/TSLAgang/status/1433896307702353921">chips fall where they may</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Message types can be in an extensible inheritance hierarchy and have &quot;fallback&quot; translation mechanisms defined in their on-chain schema for platforms that don't support specific leaf types. As an example: on-chain schema <code>42</code> can have the following template for serialization: <code>&quot;{asset} has an {probability} chance of being {above_or_below} {price} by {date}&quot;</code>, and thus a basic application that encounters <code>{message_type: &quot;42&quot;, asset: &quot;$BTC&quot;, date: &quot;2025.02.12&quot;, above_or_below: &quot;above&quot;, price: &quot;100000$&quot;, probability: &quot;80%&quot;}</code> could render <code>&quot;$BTC has an 80% chance of being above 100000$ by 2025.02.12&quot;</code>. Or there could be a message type with spline curves. This way the system can evolve even if applications move at different pace and there's no consensus on the evolution of messages - it will naturally happen. Rigidness and/or lack of consensus for such standards has been the bane for many open systems.</p>
<p>The argument that specialized message types are unnecessary because AI will eventually be able to classify things properly is mute - lets get something that is unambiguous and working now - structure is good. The use case for reputation goes beyond finance.</p>
<!-- Perhaps the reputation system can be abused - by making 100 accounts and building different prediction timelines throughout time and then using only the winners - this page should be treated just as a starting point and isn't trying to provide all the answers. -->

<p>&quot;Finally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust. Self-authenticated data can retain metadata, like who published something and whether it was changed. Reputation and trust-graphs can be constructed on top of users, content, and services. The transparency provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing">verifiable computation</a> provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced. We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.&quot; - <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol">bluesky</a></p>
